      <title>A new expression for the production term in the relativistic model of polyatomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new expression is here proposed for the production term Q in the Boltzmann Equation. This new expression satisfies the H-Theorem (non approximated) and, in the transition to Ordinary Thermodynamics gives a result which is independent on the number N of the moments which are used both if the Maxwellian Iteration or the Eckart method are used.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in single species Ising Models with Non-Reciprocal couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for incorporating non-reciprocal interactions into the Ising model with Glauber dynamics, without requiring multiple species. We then focus on a model with vision-cone type interactions. We solve it in a fully connected network (mean-field) and perform extensive numerical simulations of the model in the square lattice. We find that the breakdown of the spin-flip symmetry introduced by non-reciprocity induces a discontinuous phase transition on top of the usual continuous one, that eventually occurs at higher critical temperatures. Combining a static and dynamic scaling analysis, we measure the critical exponents associated to the continuous symmetry breaking transition, and find them to be identical to the ones of the Ising model in two dimensions (2D), with the exception of the exponent $\beta$ associated to the order parameter. The latter appears to increase as the non-reciprocity of the coupling increases, suggesting that, within our numerical precision, the model does not belong to the 2D Ising model universality class. The coarsening process is anisotropic, but still follows the usual dynamic scaling with an exponent compatible with the standard value with non-conserved order parameter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unified Approach to Power-Efficiency Trade-Off of Generic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the diverse functionalities of different thermal machines, their optimization relies on a case-by-case basis, lacking unified results. In this work, we propose a general approach to determine power-efficiency trade-off relation (PETOR) for any thermal machine. For cases where cycle (of duration $\tau$) irreversibility satisfies the typical $1/\tau$-scaling, we provide a unified PETOR which is applicable to heat engines, refrigerators, heat exchangers and heat pumps. It is shown that, some typical PETORs, such as those for low-dissipation Carnot cycles (including heat engine and refrigerator cycles) and the steady-state heat engines operating between finite-sized reservoirs are naturally recovered.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamical quantum phase transition in a $Z_3$ symmetric chiral clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quench dynamics in a $Z_3$ symmetric chiral clock model (CCM). The results reveal that chiral phases can lead to the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). By analyzing Lee-Yang-Fisher zeros' distribution in the complex plane, we uncover the relation between the chiral phase and the emergence of DQPT. In concrete terms, only by taking some special angles can DQPT be induced. We confirm the above relation by computing the non-analytic points in Loschmidt echo return rate function. Furthermore, through the analysis of the corresponding dynamical partition function, we reveal the mechanism of the emergent DQPT and deduce the analytical expression of dynamical partition function's zero points' coordinates. Based on the analytic expression, one can obtain all the angles that induce DQPT's emergence and predict more possible DQPT in the system.</description>

      <title>Self-congruent point in critical matrix product states: An effective field theory for finite-entanglement scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set up an effective field theory formulation for the renormalization flow of matrix product states (MPS) with finite bond dimension, focusing on systems exhibiting finite-entanglement scaling close to a conformally invariant critical fixed point. We show that the finite MPS bond dimension $\chi$ is equivalent to introducing a perturbation by a relevant operator to the fixed-point Hamiltonian. The fingerprint of this mechanism is encoded in the $\chi$-independent universal transfer matrix's gap ratios, which are distinct from those predicted by the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory. This phenomenon defines a renormalization group self-congruent point, where the relevant coupling constant ceases to flow due to a balance of two effects; When increasing $\chi$, the infrared scale, set by the correlation length $\xi(\chi)$, increases, while the strength of the perturbation at the lattice scale decreases. The presence of a self-congruent point does not alter the validity of the finite-entanglement scaling hypothesis, since the self-congruent point is located at a finite distance from the critical fixed point, well inside the scaling regime of the CFT. We corroborate this framework with numerical evidences from the exact solution of the Ising model and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of an effective lattice model.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

      <title>Robustness of near-thermal dynamics on digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10794v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of gate errors on quantum circuits is crucial to determining the potential applications of quantum computers, especially in the absence of large-scale error-corrected hardware. We put forward analytical arguments, corroborated by extensive numerical and experimental evidence, that Trotterized quantum circuits simulating the time-evolution of systems near thermal equilibrium are substantially more robust to both quantum gate errors and Trotter (discretization) errors than is widely assumed. In Quantinuum's trapped-ion computers, the weakly entangling gates that appear in Trotterized circuits can be implemented natively, and their error rate is smaller when they generate less entanglement; from benchmarking, we know that the error for a gate $\exp[-i (Z\otimes Z) \tau]$ decreases roughly linearly with $\tau$, up to a small offset at $\tau = 0$. We provide extensive evidence that this scaling, together with the robustness of near-thermal dynamics to both gate and discretization errors, facilitates substantial improvements in the achievable accuracy of Trotterized dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We make heavy use of a new theoretical tool -- a statistical ensemble of random product states that approximates a thermal state, which can be efficiently prepared with low noise on quantum computers. We outline how the random product state ensemble can be used to predict, optimize, and design Hamiltonian simulation experiments on near-thermal quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum and addendum: Long-range multi-scalar models at three loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We correct the computation of one Feynman diagram in the three-loop beta functions for the long-range quartic multi-scalar model, originally presented in (2020 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 445008) [arXiv:2007.04603]. The correction requires the use of a different method than in the original paper, and we give here full details about the method. We then report the updated numerics for critical exponents of the Ising model, vector model, cubic model and bifundamental model. Mathematica files for the numerical evaluation of the corrected diagram are provided in ancillary.</description>

      <title>Young Researchers School 2024 Maynooth: Lectures on CFT, BCFT and DCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The material of these notes was presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT) with emphasis on the topics relevant to the remaining classes at this school. This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraints are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-thermodynamics approach to the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be enhanced although it falls off for larger values of the coupling strength. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for hierarchically organized states within the energy landscape. This leads to a non-homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove the well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slows during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent energy barriers and transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rates, providing analytical solutions to relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential for both foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics, as well as for applications including quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient thermal state preparation of a given many-body Hamiltonian depends on the spectrum of Lindbladian defined via jump operators. In this work we provide a systematic framework allowing construction of an optimal Lindbladian resulting in fast thermal state preparation for a considered Hamiltonian. Importantly, the optimal Lindbladian respects the symmetries of the target equilibrium state. We demonstrate the potential of our framework and optimization with the kinetic Ising model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, showcasing efficient thermal state preparation.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Topological Order under Coherent Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phases of matter under local decoherence have recently garnered significant attention due to the ubiquitous presence of noise in current quantum processors. One of the key issues is understanding how topological quantum memory is affected by realistic coherent noises, such as random rotation noise and amplitude damping noise. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic error threshold of the two-dimensional toric code, a paradigmatic topological quantum memory, under these coherent noises by employing both analytical and numerical methods based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism. A connection between the mixed-state phase of the decohered toric code and a non-Hermitian Ashkin-Teller-type statistical mechanics model is established, and the mixed-state phase diagrams under the coherent noises are obtained. We find remarkable stability of mixed-state topological order under random rotation noise with axes near the $Y$-axis of qubits. We also identify intriguing extended critical regions at the phase boundaries, highlighting a connection with non-Hermitian physics. The upper bounds for the intrinsic error threshold are determined by these phase boundaries, beyond which quantum error correction becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with "ultrafast" dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into local and incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states play a critical role in quantum information processing. While random quantum circuits typically provide pseudo-random states, deep thermalization introduces quantum measurement to generate genuinely random states. However, the requirement of large ancillae in conventional deep thermalization poses a challenge to scale up the system size. We introduce holographic deep thermalization to substantially reduce the required ancillae to a system-size independent constant. Our circuit design trades space with time, via adopting a sequential application of an scrambling-measure-reset process on a small number of ancillae. Via tuning the ancilla size and number of time steps, holographic deep thermalization allows a continuous trade-off between the total quantum circuit size and the ancilla size. In the case of finite-size systems, we further enhance the performance of holographic deep thermalization via generative quantum machine learning, which leads to constant-factor advantages in the convergence towards Haar random. The theoretical predictions are verified with IBM Quantum noisy simulations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self-Organization in Fixed-Magnetization Particle Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical sorting is a fundamental task for programmable matter, inspired by the spontaneous formation of interfaces and membranes in nature. The task entails particles of different types, present in fixed densities, sorting into corresponding regions of a space that are themselves organized. By analyzing the Gibbs distribution of a general fixed-magnetization model of equilibrium statistical mechanics, we prove that particles moving stochastically according to local affinities solve the hierarchical sorting task. The analysis of fixed-magnetization models is notoriously difficult, and approaches that have led to recent breakthroughs in sampling the low-temperature regime only work in the variable-magnetization setting by default. To overcome this barrier, we introduce a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models. The core technique identifies a special class of configurations that contribute comparably to the two partition functions, which then serves as a bridge between the fixed- and variable-magnetization settings. Our main result is an estimate of the Gibbs distribution that unifies existing and new results for models at fixed magnetization, including the Ising, Potts, and Blume--Capel models, and leads to stochastic distributed algorithms for hierarchical sorting and other self-organizing tasks, like compression and separation.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Spectral Gap Certificates for Frustration-Free Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating spectral gaps of quantum many-body Hamiltonians is a highly challenging computational task, even under assumptions of locality and translation-invariance. Yet, the quest for rigorous gap certificates is motivated by their broad applicability, ranging from many-body physics to quantum computing and classical sampling techniques. Here we present a general method for obtaining lower bounds on the spectral gap of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit. We formulate the gap certification problem as a hierarchy of optimization problems (semidefinite programs) in which the certificate -- a proof of a lower bound on the gap -- is improved with increasing levels. Our approach encompasses existing finite-size methods, such as Knabe's bound and its subsequent improvements, as those appear as particular possible solutions in our optimization, which is thus guaranteed to either match or surpass them. We demonstrate the power of the method on one-dimensional spin-chain models where we observe an improvement by several orders of magnitude over existing finite size criteria in both the accuracy of the lower bound on the gap, as well as the range of parameters in which a gap is detected.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that should be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Pinning on the Yielding Transition of Amorphous Solid under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03874v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of a quantum thermoelectric circuit theory in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of the said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. Additionally, we have been able to develop a model of a quantum thermal step transformer. We also construct a novel model of a thermal adder circuit, paving the way to develop thermal integrated circuits. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a quasi-ergodic steady state in a dissipative Tavis-Cummings array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an atom-photon interacting system described by Tavis Cummings Hubbard (TCH) model, we demonstrate the emergence of a quasi-steady state in a dissipative environment that exhibits intriguing ergodic behavior. The TCH model undergoes a dissipative transition from normal to superradiant phase hosting a gapped Higgs and gapless Goldstone modes. However, in a large region of the phase diagram, the instability of the Goldstone mode leads to the disappearance of the stable superradiant phase. In this regime, the decorrelator dynamics reveals light cone spreading of the perturbations and positive Lyapunov exponent, indicating enhanced fluctuations. Remarkably, a quasi-steady state emerges under quench dynamics in this unstable regime; in this state, a class of collective quantities such as site averaged photon number and atomic excitations approach a steady value, in spite of large temporal fluctuations in corresponding microscopic variables. This quasi-steady state describes an incoherent fluid of photons with significant phase fluctuation. The phase space dynamics reveals a fascinating ergodic behavior in presence of dissipation, leading to the characterization of the dynamical variables into two distinct classes. The first class includes site-averaged photon numbers and atomic excitations; these exhibit a stationary distribution regardless of the initial condition indicating ergodic behavior. The second class of variables, particularly those related to phase in contrast, retain information about the initial conditions, resulting in a violation of ergodicity for finite size system. Additionally, the dynamical variables of the ergodic class exhibit fascinating collective scarring phenomenon as the peak of their distribution is attracted towards the unstable steady state, analogous to the single particle quantum scar. We discuss the relevance of our findings in the current experiments.</description>

      <title>Second law of thermodynamics: Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may happen spontaneously, either continuously (with an energy barrier) or cyclically (with time-dependent entropy barriers). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, it breaks the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiple quantum harmonic oscillators in the Tsallis statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied multiple quantum harmonic oscillators in the Tsallis statistics of entropic parameter $q$ in the cases that the distributions are power-like, separately applying the conventional expectation value, the unnormalized $q$-expectation value, and the normalized $q$-expectation value  (escort average). We obtained the expressions of the energy and the Tsallis entropy, using the Barnes zeta function. For the same oscillators, we obtained the expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, the average level of the oscillators, and the heat capacity. Numerically, we calculated the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity for various $N$ and $q$, using the expansion of the Barnes zeta function with the Hurwitz zeta function, where $N$ is the number of independent oscillators. The parameter $q$ is less than one in the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value. The parameter $q$ is greater than one in both sets of the Tsallis statistics, each of which is defined with a different $q$-expectation value. These limitations of $q$ arise from the requirements that the distributions are power-like. It was shown from the requirements for the Barnes zeta function that $q$ is greater than $N/(N+1)$ for the conventional expectation value and that $q$ is less than $(N+1)/N$ for both of the $q$-expectation values. In the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value, the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity decrease with $q$. These quantities per oscillator increase with $N$. In the Tsallis statistics with the unnormalized $q$-expectation value, the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity increase with $q$ at low temperature, while decrease with $q$ at high temperature. These quantities per oscillator increase with $N$ at low temperature, while decrease with $N$ at high temperature. The heat capacity is the Schottky-type. The quantities are affected by the zero-point energy. In the Tsallis statistics with the normalized $q$-expectation value, the $N$ dependence of the energy per oscillator and that of the heat capacity per oscillator are quite weak, and the $q$ dependence of the energy and that of the heat capacity are also weak, when the equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, is adopted. The Tsallis entropy per oscillator decreases with $N$ and the Tsallis entropy decreases with $q$.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the pseudo transitions of the Blume-Capel model on two-dimensional finite-size lattices. By employing the Wang-Landau sampling method and microcanonical inflection point analysis, we identified the positions of phase transitions as well as higher-order phase transitions. Through Metropolis sampling and canonical ensemble analysis, we obtained the corresponding geometric characteristics of the system at these transition points. The results indicate the presence of a third-order independent phase transition in the system. However, when the crystal field parameter $D$ exceeds 1.965, crossing the tricritical point, no third-order dependent phase transition is observed. Furthermore, the positions of the third-order phase transition obtained from both microcanonical and canonical analyses are consistent and mutually corroborative. We speculate that third-order dependent transitions may only occur in second-order phase transitions and not in first-order transitions.</description>

      <title>Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network</title>

Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>One point functions in large $N$ vector models at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing Krylov Complexity in Scalar Field Theory with General Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity characterizes the operator growth in the quantum many-body systems or quantum field theories. The existing literatures have studied the Krylov complexity in the low temperature limit in the quantum field theories. In this paper, we extend and systematically study the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy in a scalar field theory with general temperatures. To this end, we propose a new method to calculate the Wightman power spectrum which allows us to compute the Lanczos coefficients and subsequently to study the Krylov complexity (entropy) in general temperatures. We find that the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity (entropy) in the high temperature limit will behave somewhat differently from those studies in the low temperature limit. We give an explanation of why the Krylov complexity does not oscillate in the high-temperature region. Moreover, we uncover the transition temperature that separates the oscillating and monotonic increasing behavior of Krylov complexity.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>

Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical instanton theory for reaction rates at any temperature: How a rigorous real-time derivation solves the crossover temperature problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instanton theory relates the rate constant for tunneling through a barrier to the periodic classical trajectory on the upturned potential energy surface whose period is $\tau=\hbar/(k_{\rm B}T)$. Unfortunately, the standard theory is only applicable below the "crossover temperature", where the periodic orbit first appears. This paper presents a rigorous semiclassical ($\hbar\to0$) theory for the rate that is valid at any temperature. The theory is derived by combining Bleistein's method for generating uniform asymptotic expansions with a real-time modification of Richardson's flux-correlation function derivation of instanton theory. The resulting theory smoothly connects the instanton result at low temperature to the parabolic correction to Eyring transition state theory at high-temperature. Although the derivation involves real time, the final theory only involves imaginary-time (thermal) properties, consistent with the standard version of instanton theory. Therefore, it is no more difficult to compute than the standard theory. The theory is illustrated with application to model systems, where it is shown to give excellent numerical results. Finally, the first-principles approach taken here results in a number of advantages over previous attempts to extend the imaginary free-energy formulation of instanton theory. In addition to producing a theory that is a smooth (continuously differentiable) function of temperature, the derivation also naturally incorporates hyperasymptotic (i.e. multi-orbit) terms, and provides a framework for further extensions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>

Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a potential route towards scalably detecting SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely-related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>
