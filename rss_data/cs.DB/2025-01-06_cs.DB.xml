      <title>Revisiting Data Analysis with Pre-trained Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data analysis focuses on harnessing advanced statistics, programming, and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from vast datasets. An increasing volume and variety of research emerged, addressing datasets of diverse modalities, formats, scales, and resolutions across various industries. However, experienced data analysts often find themselves overwhelmed by intricate details in ad-hoc solutions or attempts to extract the semantics of grounded data properly. This makes it difficult to maintain and scale to more complex systems. Pre-trained foundation models (PFMs), grounded with a large amount of grounded data that previous data analysis methods can not fully understand, leverage complete statistics that combine reasoning of an admissible subset of results and statistical approximations by surprising engineering effects, to automate and enhance the analysis process. It pushes us to revisit data analysis to make better sense of data with PFMs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of systematic approaches to optimizing data analysis through the power of PFMs, while critically identifying the limitations of PFMs, to establish a roadmap for their future application in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Budgeted Spatial Data Acquisition: When Coverage and Connectivity Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data is undoubtedly becoming a commodity like oil, land, and labor in the 21st century. Although there have been many successful marketplaces for data trading, the existing data marketplaces lack consideration of the case where buyers want to acquire a collection of datasets (instead of one), and the overall spatial coverage and connectivity matter. In this paper, we take the first attempt to formulate this problem as Budgeted Maximum Coverage with Connectivity Constraint (BMCC), which aims to acquire a dataset collection with the maximum spatial coverage under a limited budget while maintaining spatial connectivity. To solve the problem, we propose two approximate algorithms with detailed theoretical guarantees and time complexity analysis, followed by two acceleration strategies to further improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments are conducted on five real-world spatial dataset collections to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>
