      <title>Boundary Delocalization and Spectral Packets for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a boundary delocalization principle for high-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result excludes persistent boundary concentration at the level of individual eigenmodes when compared to short spectral packets of sublinear length. Quantitatively, we compare boundary energies of single eigenfunctions to packet sums over frequency windows of size N_k = o(k), without asserting any asymptotic gain in magnitude. The main mode-to-packet estimate relies only on the Rellich identity. For the multi-mode bias exclusion we additionally use the boundary local Weyl law to obtain a packet zero-mean cancellation estimate. This mode-to-packet comparison is independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and is stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>

      <title>Magnetic spectral inverse problems on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish positive results for two spectral inverse problems in the presence of a magnetic potential. Exploiting the principal wave trace invariants, we first show that on closed Anosov manifolds with simple length spectrum, one can recover an electric and a magnetic (up to a natural gauge) potential from the spectrum of the associated magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. This extends a particular instance of a recent positive result on the spectral inverse problem for the Bochner Laplacian in negative curvature, obtained by M.Ceki\'c and T.Lefeuvre (2023). Similarly, we prove that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (or Steklov operator) determines at the boundary both a magnetic potential, up to gauge, and an electric potential, provided the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. Under this assumption, one can actually show that the magnetic Steklov spectrum determines the full Taylor series at the boundary of any smooth magnetic field and electric potential. As a simple consequence, in this case, both an analytic magnetic field and an analytic electric potential are uniquely determined by their Steklov spectrum.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dependence of non-zero Steklov eigenvalues on smooth perturbations of the domain boundary. We prove that these eigenvalues are generically simple under such boundary perturbations. This result complements our previous work on metric perturbations, thereby establishing generic simplicity Steklov eigenvalues under both fundamental geometric variations.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of the $D_{\log}^{(\lambda, N)}$ Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recent Connes-Consani-Moscovici $D_{\log}^{(\lambda, N)}$ operators, whose spectra are currently hypothesized to approach the zeros of $\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2} +is\right)$ as $\lambda, N \rightarrow \infty$. It turns out that when considering different standard notions of error, the dissonance between the spectra and Riemann $\zeta$ zeros either appears to or can be proven to be inverse logarithmic in nature, which elegantly fits the distribution of prime numbers.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Analysis of Protein Stability and Solubility Changes upon Mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genetic mutations frequently disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, acting as primary drivers for a wide spectrum of diseases. Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes.</description>

      <title>A Complete Proof of the Simon--Lukic Conjecture for Higher-Order Szeg\H{o} Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of Simon-Lukic conjecture for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. For a probability measure $d\mu = w(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{2\pi} + d\mu_s$ with Verblunsky coefficients $\alpha=\{\alpha_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$, distinct singular points $(\theta_k)_{k=1}^{\ell}$, and multiplicities $(m_k)_{k=1}^{\ell}$, we establish the equivalence between the entropy condition \[ \int_0^{2\pi} \prod_{k=1}^{\ell} [1 - \cos(\theta - \theta_k)]^{m_k} \log w(\theta) \frac{d\theta}{2\pi} &gt; -\infty \] and the decomposition condition \[ \exists \beta^{(1)}, \ldots, \beta^{(\ell)} : \alpha = \sum_{k=1}^\ell \beta^{(k)} \,\, \text{with} \,\, (S - e^{-i\theta_k})^{m_k} \beta^{(k)} \in \ell^2, \,\, \beta^{(k)} \in \ell^{2m_k + 2}. \]
  The proof synthesizes unitary transformations, discrete Sobolev-type inequalities, higher-order Szeg\H{o} expansions, and a novel algebraic decomposition technique. Our resolution affirms that spectral theory is fundamentally local-global behavior emerges from the superposition of local resonances, each governed by its intrinsic scale.</description>

      <title>Directional Ballistic Transport in Quantum Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with potentials that are periodic in some directions and compactly supported in the others. Such systems are known to produce surface states that are weakly confined near the support of the potential. We show that a natural set of surface states exhibits directional ballistic transport, characterized by ballistic transport in the periodic directions and its absence in the others. To prove this, we develop a Floquet theory that captures the analytic variation of surface states. The main idea consists of reformulating the eigenvalue problem for surface states as a Fredholm problem via the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Quantum mixing on large Schreier graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum ergodicity describes the delocalization of most eigenfunctions of Laplace-type operators on graphs or manifolds exhibiting chaotic classical dynamics. Quantum mixing is a stronger notion, additionally controlling correlations between eigenfunctions at different energy levels. In this work, we study families of finite Schreier graphs that converge to an infinite Cayley graph and establish quantum mixing under the assumption that the limiting Cayley graph has absolutely continuous spectrum. The convergence of Schreier graphs is understood in the Benjamini-Schramm sense or in the sense of strong convergence in distribution. Our proofs rely on a new approach to quantum ergodicity, based on trace computations, resolvent approximations and representation theory. We illustrate our assumptions on several examples and provide applications to Schreier graphs associated with free products of groups and right-angled Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Computation Beyond The Reflexive Regime: Endpoint Solvability Complexity Index And Type-2 Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms. Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem \[ \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F) :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr), \] with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).
  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.
  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable reduction source for future SCI lower bounds. Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger Operators, Integral Curvature, and the Euler Characteristic of Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new connections between integral curvature bounds and the Euler characteristic of closed Riemannian manifolds through the perspective of Schr\"odinger-type operators. Central to our approach is the twisted Dirac operator \(\mathcal{D}_{\theta}\), whose index equals \(\chi(M)\). Under integral smallness conditions on the negative part of a potential \(V\) and a Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequality, we show that a suitable scaling of \(\theta\) forces the kernel of \(\mathcal{D}_{t\theta}\) to vanish, thereby implying \(\chi(M)=0\).
  Applying this framework to geometrically natural potentials yields several topological consequences. In even dimensions, sufficiently small integral bounds on partial sums of curvature operator eigenvalues force \(\chi(M)\) either to vanish or to have a sign determined by the middle dimension. For four-manifolds, a small \(L^{p}\)-norm of the negative Ricci curvature relative to the diameter guarantees \(\chi(M)\ge 0\). Moreover, when \(\chi(M)\neq 0\) we obtain a Li--Yau type lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the rough Laplacian on \(1\)-forms in terms of the diameter and an integral curvature quantity. Subsequently, we provide an explicit lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $1$-forms under almost nonnegative curvature conditions, thereby giving an affirmative answer to Yau's Problem 79.</description>

      <title>On the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let
  $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=R^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T=T^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula
  for the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graph $\Gamma$, investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of spanning trees of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity. In addition,
  we show that $F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau(\Gamma)x^n$ is a rational function with integer coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We study the Brownian loop measure on hyperbolic surfaces for Brownian motion with a constant killing rate. We compute the mass of Brownian loops with killing in a free homotopy class and then relate the total mass of loops in all essential homotopy classes to the Selberg zeta function when the surface is geometrically finite. As an application, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of different notions of regularized determinants of Laplacian, in both the compact and infinite-area cases.</description>

      <title>On the splitting of Neumann eigenvalues in perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of splitting of eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian under singular domain perturbations. We consider a domain perturbed by the excision of a small spherical hole shrinking to an interior point. Our main result establishes that the splitting of multiple eigenvalues is a generic property: if the center of the hole is located outside a set of Hausdorff dimension $N-1$ and the radius is sufficiently small, multiple eigenvalues split into branches of lower multiplicity. The proof relies on the validity of an asymptotic expansion for the perturbed eigenvalues in terms of the scaling parameter. Such an asymptotic formula is of independent interest and generalizes previous results; notably, in dimension $N\geq 3$, it is valid for holes of arbitrary shape.</description>

      <title>Principal $p-$frequency estimates on non-compact manifolds with negative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a lower bound for the principal $p-$frequency $\lambda_{1,p}(\Omega)$ on a bounded domain $\Omega$ in a non-compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n.$ Under the assumption that the Ricci curvature satisfies $\operatorname{Ric} \geq (n-1)K$ with $K&lt;0,$ we prove that $\lambda_{1,p}(\Omega) &gt; \bar{\lambda}_{D,K,n}$, where $D$ is the diameter of $\Omega$ and $\bar{\lambda}_{D,K,n}$ is explicitly defined as the first eigenvalue of an associated one-dimensional ordinary differential equation model that incorporates both $D$ and $K.$ Moreover, the estimate is sharp. This work extends previous results for the case $K=0$ to the geometrically more complex setting of negative Ricci curvature, and providing a new quantitative connection between the eigenvalue, the diameter of domains, and the curvature lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <title>Hadamard-type formulas for real eigenvalues of canonically symplectic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give first-order asymptotic expansions for the resolvent and Hadamard-type formulas for the eigenvalue curves of one-parameter families of canonically symplectic operators. We allow for parameter dependence in the boundary conditions, bounded perturbations and trace operators associated with each off-diagonal operator, and give formulas for derivatives of eigenvalue curves emanating from the discrete eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator in terms of Maslov crossing forms. We derive the Hadamard-type formulas using two different methods: via a symplectic resolvent difference formula and asymptotic expansions of the resolvent, and using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction and the implicit function theorem. The latter approach facilitates derivative formulas when the eigenvalue curves are viewed as functions of the spectral parameter. We apply our abstract results to derive a spectral index theorem for the linearised operator associated with a standing wave in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a compact star graph.</description>

      <title>Equivalent spectral theory for fundamental graph cut problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop equivalent spectral graph theory for several fundamental graph cut problems including maxcut, mincut, Cheeger cut, anti-Cheeger cut, dual Cheeger problem and their useful variants. A specified strategy for achieving an equivalent eigenproblem is proposed for a general graph cut problem via the set-pair Lov\'asz extension and the Dinkelbach scheme. For a class of 2-cut and 3-cut problems, we reveal the intrinsic difference-of-submodularity for the fractional formulations and show that their set-pair Lov\'asz extensions yield equivalent difference-of-convex structures. Building on the Dinkelbach scheme, we finally establish a unified research roadmap for nonlinear spectral theory that provides a one-to-one correspondence between certain eigenpairs and the optimal graph cut problems. The finer structure of the eigenvectors, the Courant nodal domain theorem and the graphic feature of eigenvalues are studied systematically in the setting of these new nonlinear eigenproblems.</description>

      <title>The Born approximation for the fixed energy Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born approximation of a potential in the context of the Calder\'on inverse problem is an object that can be formally defined in terms of spectral data of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the corresponding Schr\"odinger operator. In this article, we prove, in the case of radial potentials in the Euclidean ball and any fixed energy, that the Born approximation is well-defined as a compactly supported radial distribution, and that the Calder\'on problem can be reformulated as recovering a potential from its Born approximation. In addition, we show that the Born approximation depends locally on the potential and captures exactly its singularities, and that the functional that maps the Born approximation to the potential is H\"older continuous. We also prove that the Born approximation converges to the potential in the high-energy limit. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the Fourier transform of the Born approximation at any fixed energy, and illustrate how it can be used as the basis of an accurate procedure to approximate a potential from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Recovery of Sturm-Liouville operators from partial boundary spectral data and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem on a finite interval from partial knowledge of spectral data. Specifically, we show that the potential can be uniquely reconstructed from the knowledge of a fraction of Dirichlet eigenvalues together with the normal derivatives of the corresponding eigenfunctions at both endpoints. We present two novel applications of our spectral result in inverse coefficient determination problems for evolutionary PDEs that include passive wave-based imaging of a medium and active imaging for the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with unknown internal sources. Our results yield finite time measurement bounds for such inverse coefficient determination problems. A central innovation is the use of Kahane's interpolation theorem to analyze endpoint time traces of solutions, enabling the recovery without requiring analyticity assumptions or infinite-time data, as in previous approaches. Finally, in the appendix, we present a spectral interpolation theorem for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On eigenvalues of the Landau Hamiltonian with a periodic electric potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Landau Hamiltonian $\widehat H_B+V$ on $L^2({\mathbb R}^2)$ with a periodic electric potential $V$. For every $m\in {\mathbb N}$ we prove that there exist nonconstant periodic electric potentials $V\in C^{\infty }({\mathbb R}^2;{\mathbb R})$ with zero mean values that analytically depend on a small parameter $\varepsilon \in {\mathbb R}$ such that the Landau level $(2m+1)B$ is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian (of infinite multiplicity) where $B&gt;0$ is a strength of a homogeneous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Upper and Lower Bounds for The Quantum Dynamics of One-Dimensional Divergence-Type Random Jacobi Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum transport for the discrete one-dimensional random Jacobi operator of divergence-gradient type. For strictly positive and bounded random variables, we analyze the q-moments of the position operator and establish both upper and lower power-law bounds on their growth. Our approach relies on the asymptotic behavior of the integrated density of states and the Lyapunov exponent near the critical energy 0, previously obtained by Pastur and Figotin. A key ingredient in our analysis is the large deviation-type estimates explored via the phase formalism, which play a central role in deriving bounds on the growth of the transfer matrices.</description>
