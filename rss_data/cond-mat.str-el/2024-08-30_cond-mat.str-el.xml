      <title>Order and disorder in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states at filling factor 3/4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states have been observed at filling factor $\nu=3/4$ in three platforms. General theoretical analysis of topological orders at $\nu=3/4$ revealed that four types of non-Abelian states with Ising anyons have ground state degeneracy $12$ on the torus. The properties of $\nu=3/4$ states can be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are treated as particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the second one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment at effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer quantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type states. For the specific case of bilayer graphene, numerical calculations demonstrate that strong Landau level mixing could generate a gapped state at $\nu=3/4$ with 12 fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. Its chiral graviton spectral functions has one low energy peak with negative chirality and one high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member of the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter states.</description>

      <title>Exchange kernel $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ of electron liquid from the variational principle of McLachlan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By minimizing, in the $L_2$ norm, the difference between the left- and the right-hand sides of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the variational principle of McLachlan (McLVP) [A. McLachlan, Molecular Physics {\bf 8}, 39 (1964)] provides a powerful tool for the generation of equations of motion. If the trial wave function is the Slater determinant, McLVP produces a temporally and spatially nonlocal exchange potential [V. U. Nazarov, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 87}, 165125 (2013)]. We study the performance of the corresponding wave-vector and frequency-dependent exchange kernel $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ of the homogeneous electron liquid. While the McLVP-based $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ lacks correlations by construction, we find that it accurately accounts for exchange, reproducing features in the quantum Monte Carlo data, which the known constraint-based kernels miss. We argue that the complementary use of the McLVP- and the constraint-based exchange-correlation kernels will enhance the performance of the linear response time-dependent density functional theory of the electron liquid.</description>

      <title>Influence of anti-ferromagnetic ordering and electron correlation on the electronic structure of MnTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation and long-range magnetic ordering have a significant impact on the electronic structure and physical properties of solids. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of ilmenite MnTiO$_{3}$ using room temperature photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical approaches within density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$ and DFT+dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Mn 2$p$ (Ti 2$p$) core level photoemission spectra, confirming Mn$^{2+}$ (Ti$^{4+}$) oxidation state, exhibit multiple satellites which are very similar to that of MnO (TiO$_{2}$), suggesting similar strength of various interactions in this system. Valence band spectra collected at different photon energies suggest dominant Mn 3$d$ character in the highest occupied band with a wide insulating gap. DFT(+$U$) correctly predicts the experimentally observed anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) insulating ground state for MnTiO$_3$ where the requirement of a large $U$ to reproduce the experimental values of magnetic moment and band gap signifies the importance of electron correlation. Magnetically disordered paramagnetic (PM) phase could be well captured within DFT+DMFT, which provides an excellent agreement for the experimental band gap, paramagnetic moment, valence band spectra as well as dominant Mn 3$d$ character in the highest occupied band. The calculated spectral function remains largely unaffected and exhibits sharper features in the magnetically ordered AFM phase. We show that the electronic structure of MnTiO$_{3}$ in both the PM and AFM phases can be accurately described within DFT+DMFT.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the J1-J2 Heisenberg second-order topological quantum magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competing interactions in quantum magnets lead to a variety of emergent states, including ordered phases, nematic magnets and quantum spin liquids. Among them, topological quantum magnets represent a promising platform to create topological excitations protected by the bulk many-body excitation gap. Here we establish the phase diagram of a breathing frustrated antiferromagnetic J1-J2-Heisenberg model, featuring both ordered states and a higher-order topological quantum magnet state. Using exact many-body methods based on neural network quantum states and tensor networks, we determine the existence of a first order phase transition between stripe order and the topological quantum magnet and the second order phase transition between the Neel order and quantum magnet phase, further corroborated by calculations of the many-body gap. Using an auxiliary fermion parton formalism, we show the emergence of topological spinon corner modes stemming from the breathing order parameter of the parent Heisenberg model. Our results establish the breathing frustrated square lattice Heisenberg model as a paradigmatic system to engineer topological quantum magnetism, as recently realized in Ti lattices at MgO.</description>

      <title>Chiral-Split Magnon in Altermagnetic MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a newly discovered magnetic class named after the alternating spin polarizations in both real and reciprocal spaces. Like the spin-splitting of electronic bands, the magnon bands in altermagnets are predicted to exhibit alternating chiral splitting. In this work, by performing inelastic neutron scattering on $\alpha$-MnTe, we directly verified the chiral splitting in altermagnetic magnon dispersions. The lifted degeneracy of chirality is further explained by a symmetric-exchange origin. In addition, the $g$-wave magnetism was identified in MnTe.</description>

      <title>Anomalous amplitude mode dynamics below the expected charge-density-wave transition in 1$T$-VSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A charge-density-wave (CDW) is characterized by a dynamical order parameter consisting of a time-dependent amplitude and phase, which manifest as optically-active collective modes of the CDW phase. Studying the behaviour of such collective modes in the time-domain, and their coupling with electronic and lattice order, provides important insight into the underlying mechanisms behind CDW formation. In this work, we report on femtosecond broadband transient reflectivity experiments on bulk 1$T$-VSe$_2$ using near-infrared excitation. At low temperature, we observe coherent oscillations associated with the CDW amplitude mode and phonons of the distorted lattice. Across the expected transition temperature at 110 K, we confirm signatures of a rearrangement of the electronic structure evident in the quasiparticle dynamics. However, we find that the amplitude mode instead softens to zero frequency at 80 K, possibly indicating an additional phase transition at this temperature. In addition, we demonstrate photoinduced CDW melting, associated with a collapse of the electronic and lattice order, which occurs at moderate excitation densities, consistent with a dominant electron-phonon CDW mechanism.</description>

      <title>Evolution of two-magnon bound states in a higher-spin ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy: A complete solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-magnon bound states in quantum spin chains have been long studied and attracted much recent attentions. For a higher-spin ferromagnetic XXZ chain with single-ion anisotropy, several features regarding the evolution of the low-lying two-magnon bound states with varying wave number were observed in the literature. However, most of these observations are only qualitatively understood due to the lack of analytical tools. By combining a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz, we achieve a complete solution of the two-magnon problem in such a system. We identify parameter regions that support different types of two-magnon bound states, with the boundaries defined by algebraic equations. We discover for the first time a narrow region in which two single-ion bound states coexist. We show that the phase diagrams for distinct wave numbers are similar to each other, which enables us to map the evolution of the bound states to the rectilinear movement of a representative point for given parameters in a rescaled phase diagram. This dynamic picture provides quantitative interpretations of the observed features.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of moir\'e skyrmion phases in twisted multiferroic NiI$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals materials provide a flexible platform to engineer new forms of unconventional magnetism. Here we demonstrate the emergence of electrically tunable topological moir\'e magnetism in twisted bilayers of the spin-spiral multiferroic NiI$_2$. We establish a rich phase diagram featuring uniform spiral phases, a variety of $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices, and nematic spin textures ordered at the moir\'e scale. The emergence of these phases is driven by the local stacking and the resulting modulated frustration in the spin spiral stemming from the moir\'e pattern. Notably, when the spin-spiral wavelength is commensurate with the moir\'e length scale by an integer $k$, multi-walled skyrmions become pinned to the moir\'e pattern. We show that the strong magnetoelectric coupling displayed by the moir\'e multiferroic allows the electric control of the $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices by an out-of-plane electric field, which couples to the moir\'e-induced electric polarization. While adiabatic changes in the electric field preserve the topology of the spin configurations, abrupt variations can trigger transitions between different skyrmion lattice ground states. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for skyrmionics based on twisted van der Waals multiferroics, potentially enabling a new generation of ultrathin topologically-protected spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands in hyperbolic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands (TFBs) provide a promising platform to investigate intriguing fractionalization phenomena, such as the fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Most of TFB models are established in two-dimensional Euclidean lattices with zero curvature. In this work, we systematically explore TFBs in a class of two-dimensional non-Euclidean lattices with constant negative curvature, {\emph i.e.,} the hyperbolic analogs of the kagome lattice. Based on the Abelian hyperbolic band theory, TFBs have been respectively found in the heptagon-kagome, the octagon-kagome, the nonagon-kagome and the decagon-kagome lattices by introducing staggered magnetic fluxes and the next nearest-neighbor hoppings. The flatness ratios of all hyperbolic TFB models are more than 15, which suggests that the hyperbolic FCIs can be realized in these TFB models. We further demonstrate the existence of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI state with open boundary conditions when hard-core bosons fill into these hyperbolic TFB models.</description>

      <title>Canonical strong coupling spin wave expansion of Kondo lattice magnets. I. Effective Hamiltonian via canonical transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic strong coupling spin wave expansion of itinerant Kondo lattice magnets, magnets in which local moment spins are Kondo coupled to itinerant charge degrees of freedom. The strong coupling expansion is based on a canonical Schrieffer-Wolff transformation of the Hamiltonian, which is performed after $1/S$ expansion of the local moments and determined iteratively by requiring that spin-flip terms are removed at each order. We demonstrate that the canonical transformation can be viewed as an order-by-order diagonalization of the quantum Kondo coupling -- the dominant term in the strong coupling regime. A consequence is that the transformed electron operators correspond to electrons in a state of total spin $S\pm 1/2$ with the local moments, and the transformed boson operators describe spin wave excitations of the total local spin. We show that the electron degrees of freedom can be thought of as tightly bound spin polarons. We further show that the strong coupling spin wave expansion is readily extended to include the effects of spin-orbit coupling or electron pairing.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Heisenberg toy models: Comparison of exact results and spin wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of exactly solvable Kondo-Heisenberg toy models in one dimension, with the goal of comparing the exact low-energy excitations of the ferromagnetic ground state to the approximate solution obtained from spin wave theory. In doing so we employ a recently introduced strong coupling $1/S$ spin wave expansion, which effectively describes excitations of the total spin $S\pm 1/2$ on a given site (i.e., sum of local moment and electron spin). We further make use of the fact that the ground state of Kondo lattice models with quantum spins and a single electron is a ferromagnet, and that the magnetic excitations of the ferromagnet can be exactly determined. We demonstrate that the energies and eigenstates of the spin waves are in full agreement with the exact solution order-by-order in $1/S$ and $t/J_K$, the strong coupling expansion parameter. In the specific case of antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling, when the exact ground state wave function describes spin polaron, we show that the electron operators of the spin wave formalism precisely correspond to the spin polaron states. More broadly, the study of Kondo-Heisenberg toy models is shown to provide insight into the fundamental distinction between itinerant Kondo magnets and Heisenberg magnets.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Moments in the Chern Bands of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has elements in common with two paradigmatic examples of strongly correlated physics: quantum Hall physics and Hubbard physics. On one hand, TBG hosts flat topological Landau-level-like bands which exhibits quantum anomalous Hall effects. On the other hand, these bands have concentrated charge density and show signs of extensive entropy resembling local moments. The combination of these features leads to a question: can decoupled moments emerge in an isolated topological band, despite the lack of exponentially localized Wannier states? In this work, we answer the question affirmatively by proposing a minimal model for these bands in TBG that combines topology and charge concentration at the AA sites, leading to analytic wavefunctions that closely approximate those of the BM model with realistic parameters. Importantly, charge concentration also leads to Berry curvature concentration at $\Gamma$, generating a small parameter $s$ that yields analytic tractability. We show that, rather surprisingly, the model hosts nearly decoupled flavor moments without any extra degrees of freedom. These moments are non-local due to topology-enforced power-law tails, yet have parametrically small overlap. We further develop a diagrammatic expansion in which the self energy can be computed exactly to leading order in $s^2$ in the fluctuating moment regime. At charge neutrality, we find a "Mott semimetal", with large flavor entropy and a Mott gap everywhere in the BZ except for the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. Away from neutrality, the Mott semimetal gaps out in a spectrally imbalanced manner, with one Mott band having zero $Z_k$ at the $\Gamma$ point. The model accurately reproduces results from finite temperature thermodynamic measurements, leads to new experimental predictions, and resolves the problem of the emergence of Hubbard physics in isolated topological bands.</description>

Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity from repulsive interactions in twisted WSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ raises intriguing questions concerning the origin and the properties of superconducting states realized in bands with non-trivial topological properties and repulsive electron-electron interactions. Using a continuum band structure model, we analyze a mechanism for Coulomb interaction-driven superconductivity in twisted bilayers of WSe$_2$. We discuss the symmetries and the phenomenological properties of the resulting superconducting phases and their evolution with interlayer potential difference, tunable via an out of plane electric field. The pairing strength is a non-monotonic function of interlayer potential, being larger at intermediate values due to mixing of singlet and triplet pairing. In contrast, at larger interlayer potential, the pairing tendency is suppressed due to enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The superconducting state is chiral in a large regime of parameters and undergoes a transition to a nodal nematic superconductor at a critical potential difference. The chiral state, characterized by an intervalley-symmetric superposition of triplet and singlet pairs, is classified as a topological superconductor within the Altland-Zirnbauer class C. At zero interlayer potential difference, the superconducting state is instead of class D, which hosts Majorana zero modes, making it a promising candidate for applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable optical properties due to the diverse number of strongly bound excitons, which can be fine-tuned by alloying. Despite a flurry of research activity in characterizing these excitons, a comprehensive and profound understanding of their behavior with temperature is lacking. Here, we report the rich spectrum of excitonic features within bulk van der Waals alloy Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ and Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$Se$_2$ single crystals through temperature-dependent reflectance spectroscopy and first-principle calculations. We observed Rydberg excitons and interlayer excitons in both the single crystals. Notably, we provide the first experimental evidence of highly energetic A$^\prime$ and B$^\prime$ excitons in Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ at room temperature. The strong carrier-phonon scattering significantly broadens the A$^\prime$, B$^\prime$ and interlayer excitons at room temperature in bulk Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ single crystal compared to its selenide. Our findings, supported by density functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, signify the crucial role of carrier-phonon interactions. These results open pathways for next-generation optoelectronic devices and quantum technologies operating at high temperature.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Sliding Wigner crystals in bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AB-stacked bilayer graphene has emerged as a fascinating yet simple platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena of correlated electrons. Unexpectedly, an insulating phase has recently been observed when a large electric displacement field is applied and the charge carrier density is tuned to the vicinity of an ultra-low-density van Hove singularity. This phase exhibits features consistent with Wigner crystallization, including a characteristic temperature dependence and non-linear current bias behavior. However, more direct evidence for the emergence of an electron crystal in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero magnetic field remains elusive. Here we explore the low-frequency noise generated by the depinning and sliding of the Wigner crystal lattice. The current bias and frequency dependence of these noise spectra align well with findings from previous experimental and theoretical studies on the quantum electron solids. Our results offer a compelling transport signature of Wigner crystallization in AB-stacked bilayer graphene at zero and finite magnetic fields, paving the way for further substantiating an anomalous Hall crystal in its original form.</description>

      <title>The antiferromagnetic $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the ${\text{C}}_{60}$ fullerene geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.12083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the quantum-mechanical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with spins positioned on vertices of the truncated icosahedron using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG). This describes magnetic properties of the undoped C$_{60}$ fullerene at half filling in the limit of strong on-site interaction $U$. We calculate the ground state and correlation functions for all possible distances, the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, as well as thermodynamic properties, namely the specific heat and spin susceptibility.
  We find that unlike smaller C$_{20}$ or C$_{32}$ that are solvable by exact diagonalization, the lowest excited state is a triplet rather than a singlet, indicating a reduced frustration due to the presence of many hexagon faces and the separation of the pentagonal faces, similar to what is found for the truncated tetrahedron. This implies that frustration may be tuneable within the fullerenes by changing their size.
  The spin-spin correlations are much stronger along the hexagon bonds and exponentially decrease with distance, so that the molecule is large enough not to be correlated across its whole extent. The specific heat shows a high-temperature peak and a low-temperature shoulder reminiscent of the kagome lattice, while the spin susceptibility shows a single broad peak and is very close to the one of C$_{20}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids represent exotic states of spin systems characterized by long-range entanglement and emergent fractionalized quasiparticles. It is generally believed that disorder is hostile to quantum spin liquids. In our study, we investigated the magnetic properties of a kagome system, YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_{y}$]. Within this system, some of the hexagons exhibit alternate bonds along the Cu-O-Cu exchange paths, while others remain uniform. We found that a long-range antiferromagnetic order emerges when uniform hexagons dominate. Conversely, a possible quantum-spin-liquid state arises when the number of alternate-bond hexagons exceeds about 2/3. Therefore, the alternate-bond hexagons, typically considered as disorders, actually serve as the building blocks of the quantum spin liquid in this system. Notably, the low-temperature properties of the quantum spin liquid are directly associated with the height of the out-of-plane yttrium ions, which may be linked to changes in superexchange energies. Our results suggest that understanding the magnetic ground states in this system lies beyond the theoretical framework of the Heisenberg model constructed on the kagome lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing first-principles modelling and many-body methods, the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 chain compound NaVOPO$_4$ are explored. The extensive first-principles calculations establish an intricate three-dimensionally coupled model that consists of weakly alternating $J$-$J^{\prime}$ antiferromagnetic chains running along cris-cross directions between two consecutive $ab$ planes, connected via two subleading couplings, a ferromagnetic exchange along the $c$ direction ($J_c$) and a weaker antiferromagnetic exchange ($J_a$) along the body diagonal direction. The exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalized group study has been carried out on a two-dimensional spin model with $J$-$J^{\prime}$-$J_c$ and effective $J_d$ couplings, constructed based on the full model, for numerical ease. The $J_c$-$J_d$ phase diagram is found to host a {\it disorder} phase with a finite spin gap for comparable values of $J_c$ and $J_d$, arising out of the competing nature of these two interactions, other than two ordered phases. The calculated thermodynamic properties of this model provide a fair description of experimentally measured data. The predominant manifestation of $J_c$ and $J_d$ in the disorder phase happens in the stabilisation of a multi-magnon condensed phase, upon gap closing by application of an external magnetic field. We further explore the effect of tensile uniaxial strain, which is found to drive the system from gapful to gapless ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored 4-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of two harmonically trapped atoms in the presence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum (SOAM) coupling. The two-body energy spectrum is numerically calculated by utilizing the exact diagonalization method. We analyze how the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted under the interplay between the interatomic interaction and SOAM coupling. The exact numerical results show excellent agreement with that of perturbation theory in the weak-interaction limit as well as that in the absence of SOAM coupling. The properties of correlations between the two atoms are also discussed with respect to the interaction strength. The findings in this paper may provide valuable insights into few-body physics subjected to SOAM coupling and the possible experimental detection of spectrum functions in many-body systems, such as radiofrequency spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: In a quantum Hall interferometer, the dependence of the signal on source-drain voltage is controlled by details of the edge physics, such as the velocities of edge modes and the interaction between them and with screening layers. Such dependence of the signal has been seen in recent experiments at various integer and fractional filling factors, including $\nu=2$ and $\nu=2/5$, where two edge modes are present. Here we study theoretically the current-voltage curves for various values of the relative edge velocities, interaction strength, and the temperature, in a model containing two edge modes. We consider separate cases in which the inner mode or the outer mode is weakly backscattered at the tunneling contacts. When the inner mode is completely reflected and the outer mode is partially transmitted, we find striking features at very low temperatures related to resonance of excitations of the closed inner channel. Fluctuations in the charge of the closed inner mode, caused by sparse tunneling events, lead to an exponential suppression of the interference visibility at high voltages, in agreement with experiments.</description>

Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine "applying" the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $\frac{h}{J} = \frac{J_z}{J_x}$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature and an extensive ground state entropy. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually \guillemotleft anticommuting\guillemotright $\;$ sets of $local$ conserved quantities for $H$. Such a structure will be shown to be not unnatural in the class of bond-dependent Hamiltonians. In the above quantum Ising model inspired example of $H$, this is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed. Thus this is more general and forms the basis for an exact statement on the existence of extensive ground state entropy in any dimension. Furthermore this structure can be used to prove spin liquidity non-perturbatively in the ground state manifold. Higher-dimensional quantum spin liquid constructions based on this are given which may evade a quasiparticle description.</description>
