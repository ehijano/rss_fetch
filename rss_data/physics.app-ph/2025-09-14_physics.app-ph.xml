      <title>Image detection-based high-throughput sorting of particles using traveling surface acoustic waves in microscale flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large particle sorters have potential applications in sorting microplastics and large biomaterials (&gt;50 micrometer), such as tissues, spheroids, organoids, and embryos. Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of cells and particles (&lt;50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput sorting of larger biomaterials and particles (&gt;50 micrometer) has been more limited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness of the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density) that can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or particles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with a contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface acoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and particles (&lt;50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (&lt;1 ms), high biocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally, TSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based detection technique. In this work, a high-throughput image-detection based large particle microfluidic sorting technique is implemented. The technique is used to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles (ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size). All particles in flow were first optically interrogated for size, followed by actuations using momentum transfer from TSAW pulses, if they satisfied the size cutoff criterion. The effect of control parameters such as duration and power of TSAW actuation pulse, inlet flow rates, and sample dilution on sorting efficiency and throughput was observed. At the chosen conditions, this sorting technique can sort on average ~4.9-34.3 particles/s (perform ~2-3 actuations/s), depending on the initial sample composition and concentration.</description>

      <title>Coupled CFD-DEM model for dry powder inhalers simulation: validation and sensitivity analysis for the main model parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of computational techniques in the design of dry powder inhalers (DPI), as well as in unravelling the complex mechanisms of drug aerosolization, has increased significantly in recent years. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to study the air flow, inside the DPI, during the patient inspiratory act while discrete element methods (DEM) are used to simulate the dispersion and aerosolization of the drug product powder particles. In this work we discuss the possibility to validate a coupled CFD-DEM model for the NextHaler DPI device against previously published experimental data. The approximations and assumptions made are deeply discussed. The comparison between computational and experimental results is detailed both for fluid and powder flows. Finally, the potential and possible applications of a calibrated DPI model are discussed as well as the missing elements necessary to achieve a fully quantitatively predictive computational model.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for spin torque oscillator tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of automatic synchronisation of the spintronic oscillator (STO) by means of reinforcement learning (RL). A numerical solution of the macrospin Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation is used to simulate the STO and we train the two types of RL agents to synchronise with a target frequency within a fixed number of steps. We explore modifications to this base task and show an improvement in both convergence and energy efficiency of the synchronisation that can be easily achieved in the simulated environment.</description>

      <title>Morphogenetic mechanical metamaterials: Emerging tensor properties from self-organized structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how living organisms spontaneously develop complex functional structures inspires innovative approaches in engineering design. Here, we introduce a decentralized generative model based on morphogenesis to autonomously grow mechanical structures with controlled tensorial properties. By adapting Turing's reaction-diffusion concept through anisotropic diffusion, our approach enables the local emergence of microstructures exhibiting tailored stiffness and anisotropy, achieving target orthotropic tensors without adjoint or topology optimization loops. The synthesis of these structures relies on a database linking morphogenetic parameters to effective elastic tensors obtained through homogenization techniques. We experimentally demonstrate this concept through a mechanical cloaking example, validating our method's capability to independently control local anisotropy and rigidity, and effectively conceal structural defects from mechanical fields. This approach not only addresses key limitations of traditional topology optimization methods but also opens new bio-inspired pathways for scalable and robust mechanical metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Control of nanomechanical resonances by an electron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of mechanical resonators to physical quantities such as acceleration, pressure, mass and temperature enables them to underpin sensing and metrology applications. Here, we observe that the resonance frequency of a nanomechanical resonator depends strongly on charging. We show that repulsion between an electron beam and charge accumulated on a nanomechanical cantilever yields a stiffening that increases its resonance frequency, providing a mechanism for controlling resonators and sensing charge. For a cantilever of microscale length and nanoscale cross-section interacting with the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope, we observe a resonance shift on the order of 1% per nanocoulomb.</description>

      <title>An overview of PBPK and PopPK Models: Applications to Radiopharmaceutical Therapies for Analysis and Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review discusses the current applications, advantages, and limitations of PBPK and PopPK models in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). PBPK models simulate radiopharmaceutical kinetics by integrating prior physiological and drug parameter information, whereas PopPK models leverage population data to enhance individual dose estimation accuracy. Future directions include developing hybrid models, incorporating artificial intelligence, and establishing regulatory guidelines to promote their clinical adoption. Ultimately, these modeling strategies aim to enable precise, personalized RPT dosing, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and safety.</description>

      <title>Magnonic Combinatorial Memory for High-density Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an urgent need to enhance the storage density of memory devices to accommodate the exponentially increasing amount of data generated by humankind. In this work, we describe Magnonic Combinatorial Memory (MCM), where the bits of information are stored in the signal propagation paths in the network. The number of paths among the elements of the network is much larger compared to the number of elements, which makes it possible to enhance the data storage density compared to conventional memory devices. MCM is an active ring circuit consisting of electric and magnonic parts. The electric part includes a broadband amplifier, phase shifters, and frequency filters. The magnonic part is a mesh of frequency-dependent elements. Signal propagation path(s) in the mesh depend on the amplitude/phase matching between the electric and magnetic parts. The operation of the MCM is described based on the network model, where information is encoded in the S-parameters of the network elements as well as in the element arrangement in the network. We present experimental data for MCM with a four-terminal magnonic element. The element consists of a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 (YIG) film and magnets on top of the film. There are four micro antennas aimed to convert electromagnetic waves into spin waves and vice versa. One of the antennas is used as an input port while the other three are the output ports. Experimental data show the prominent dependence of the element S-parameters on the magnet arrangement. The number of possible arrangements scales factorially with the number of magnets. There is a number of bits that can be encoded into one magnet arrangement. The results demonstrate a robust operation of MCM with an On/Off ratio for path detection exceeding 50 dB at room temperature. Physical limits and practical constraints of MCM are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Certifiable Machine Learning-Based Pipeline to Predict Fatigue Life of Aircraft Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures. Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety. Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human resources.</description>

      <title>Noncontact friction in ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators near dielectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties. The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature, setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction (NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.</description>

      <title>LPCVD based Plasma Damage Free in situ etching of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using Solid Source Gallium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a novel in situ etching technique for $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ using solid-source metallic Ga in a LPCVD system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and patterned (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates as a function of temperature, Ar carrier gas flow, and Ga source-to-substrate distance. The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of $\sim$2.25~$\mu$m/hr on (010) substrates at 1050~$^\circ$C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and (-102), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and (-102) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or (-102) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding.</description>
