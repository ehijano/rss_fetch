      <title>An Explicit Theta Lift to Siegel Paramodular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/L$ be a real quadratic extension of number fields. We construct an explicit map from an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GL}(2,E)$ which contains a Hilbert modular form with $\Gamma_0$ level to an irreducible automorphic representation of $\mathrm{GSp}(4,L)$ which contains a Siegel paramodular form and exhibit local data which produces a paramodular invariant vector for the local theta lift at every finite place, except when the local extension has wild ramification.</description>

      <title>Entropy of Cohen-Lenstra measures: the $u$-aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\rm \mathbf{H}}(\nu^{u}_{\rm CL})$ be the entropy of the Cohen-Lenstra measure on finite abelian $p$-groups associated to an integral unit-rank $0 \le u \in \mathbb{N}$. In this note, we show that $0 &lt; {\rm \mathbf{H}}(\nu^{u}_{\rm CL}) &lt; \infty$ for all $u$, ${\rm \mathbf{H}}(\nu^{u}_{\rm CL})$ is a strictly decreasing function of $u \ge 0$, and ${\rm \mathbf{H}}(\nu^{u}_{\rm CL}) \xrightarrow{u \to \infty} 0$. In particular, this shows that the groupoid measure is an entropy maximizer in the class of Cohen-Lenstra measures of varying integral unit-rank on finite abelian $p$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an arithmetic analogue of the quantum local systems on the moduli of curves, and study its basic structure. Such an arithmetic local system gives rise to a uniform way of assigning a Galois cohomology class of the first geometric \'etale cohomology of a smooth proper curve over a number field.</description>

      <title>A cluster theory approach from mutation invariants to Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and classify the sign-equivalent exchange matrices. We give a Diophantine explanation for the differences between rank 2 cluster algebras of finite type and affine type based on \cite{CL24}. We classify the positive integer points of the Markov mutation invariant and its variant. As an application, several classes of Diophantine equations with cluster algebraic structures are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Control and its applications in additive combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new quantitative bounds on the additive structure of sets obeying an $L^3$ 'control' assumption, which arises naturally in several questions within additive combinatorics. This has a number of applications - in particular we improve the known bounds for the sum-product problem, the Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and the additive growth of convex sets.</description>

      <title>On the factorization of twisted $L$-values and $11$-descents over $C_5$-number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Galois module structure of the Tate-Shafarevich group of elliptic curves. For a Dirichlet character $\chi$, we give an explicit conjecture relating the ideal factorization of $L(E,\chi,1)$ to the Galois module structure of the Tate-Shafarevich group of $E/K$, where $\chi$ factors through the Galois group of $K/\mathbb{Q}$. We provide numerical evidence for this conjecture using the methods of visualization and $p$-descent. For the latter, we present a procedure that makes performing an $11$-descent over a $C_5$ number field practical for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with complex multiplication. We also expect that our method can be pushed to perform higher descents (e.g. $31$-descent) over a $C_5$ number field given more computational power.</description>

      <title>Refinements of Van Hamme's (E.2) and (F.2) supercongruences and two supercongruences by Swisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1997, Van Hamme proposed 13 supercongruences on truncated hypergeometric series. Van Hamme's (B.2) supercongruence was first confirmed by Mortenson and received a WZ proof by Zudilin later. In 2012, using the WZ method again, Sun extended Van Hamme's (B.2) supercongruence to the modulus $p^4$ case, where $p$ is an odd prime. In this paper, by using a more general WZ pair, we generalize Hamme's (E.2) and (F.2) supercongruences, as well as two supercongruences by Swisher, to the modulus $p^4$ case. Our generalizations of these supercongruences are related to Euler polynomials. We also put forward a relevant conjecture on $q$-congruences for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the family of monic integer polynomials of degree $n &gt; 1$ with prime coefficients. We determine the asymptotic density of polynomials in the family with squarefree discriminant as $n$ goes to infinity. We also determine the number of irreducible polynomials $f(x)$ in the family such that $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(f(x))$ is the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f(x))$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study spectral gaps of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus. We show that for any fixed $k\geq 1$, as the genus goes to infinity, the maximum of $\lambda_k-\lambda_{k-1}$ over any thick part of the moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces approaches the limit $\frac{1}{4}$.</description>

      <title>On finitely many base $q$ expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given some integer $m \geq 3$, we find the first explicit collection of countably many intervals in $(1,2)$ such that for any $q$ in one of these intervals, the set of points with exactly $m$ base $q$ expansions is nonempty and moreover has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our method relies on an application of a theorem proved by Falconer and Yavicoli, which guarantees that the intersection of a family of compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ has positive Hausdorff dimension under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Disintegration results for fractal measures and applications to Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove disintegration results for self-conformal measures and affinely irreducible self-similar measures. The measures appearing in the disintegration resemble self-conformal/self-similar measures for iterated function systems satisfying the strong separation condition. As an application of our results, we prove the following Diophantine statements:
  1. Using a result of Pollington and Velani, we show that if $\mu$ is a self-conformal measure in $\mathbb{R}$ or an affinely irreducible self-similar measure, then there exists $\alpha&gt;0$ such that for all $\beta&gt;\alpha$ we have $$\mu\left(\left\{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}:\max_{1\leq i\leq d}|x_{i}-p_i/q|\leq \frac{1}{q^{\frac{d+1}{d}}(\log q)^{\beta}}\textrm{ for i.m. }(p_1,\ldots,p_d,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^{d}\times \mathbb{N}\right\}\right)=0.$$
  2. Using a result of Kleinbock and Weiss, we show that if $\mu$ is an affinely irreducible self-similar measure, then $\mu$ almost every $\mathbf{x}$ is not a singular vector.</description>

      <title>Evaluating modular equations for abelian surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.10094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design efficient algorithms to evaluate modular equations of Siegel and Hilbert type for abelian surfaces over number fields or finite fields using complex approximations. Their output is provably correct when the associated graded ring of modular forms over Z is explicitly known; this includes the Siegel case, and the Hilbert case for the quadratic fields of discriminant 5 and 8. As part of the proofs, we establish new correctness and complexity results for certain key numerical algorithms on period matrices in genus 2, namely the reduction algorithm to the fundamental domain, the AGM method, and computing big period matrices and RM structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field. An extension $L/K$ is "weakly totally ramified" if the residue extension is purely inseparable. We sharpen a result of Ax by showing that any Galois-invariant disk in the algebraic closure of $K$ contains an element that generates a separable weakly totally ramified extension. As an application, we prove that elliptic curves and dynamical systems on $\mathbb{P}^1$ achieve semistable reduction over a separable weakly totally ramified extension of the base field. We also obtain several arithmetic consequences for torsion points on elliptic curves and preperiodic points for dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Salem numbers less than 1.324</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A certain number of lists of small Salem numbers, some of which are certified as complete, are available online. Notably, the website of M. J. Mossinghoff features a list of 47 Salem numbers smaller than 1.3 ([3]), as well as complete lists of Salem numbers of fixed degrees that are smaller than various bounds ([2]). The objective of this work is to advance the understanding of Salem numbers by providing a list of Salem numbers smaller than a threshold of 1.324 through the implementation of a method based on integer linear programming and uniform sampling of root separators. Beyond the intrinsic interest of the newly detected Salem numbers, the rediscovery of already known Salem numbers through this alternative method could offer valuable insights into the potential completeness of already existing lists for degrees where it has not yet been proven.</description>

      <title>First-order definitions of rings of integral functions over algebraic extensions of function fields and undecidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study questions of definability and decidability for infinite algebraic extensions ${\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ and their subrings of $\mathcal{S}$-integral functions. We focus on fields ${\bf K}$ satisfying a local property which we call $q$-boundedness. This can be considered a function field analogue of prior work of the first author which considered algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. One simple consequence of our work states that if ${\bf K}$ is a $q$-bounded Galois extension of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, then for infinitely many non-constant $u$ the integral closure $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p[u]$ inside ${\bf K}$ is first-order definable in ${\bf K}$. Under the additional assumption that the constant subfield of ${\bf K}$ is infinite, it follows that both $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}$ have undecidable first-order theories, and that $\mathbb{F}_p[w]$ is definable in ${\bf K}$ for every non-constant $w$ in ${\bf K}$. Our primary tools are norm equations and the Hasse Norm Principle, in the spirit of Rumely. Our paper has an intersection with a recent arXiv preprint by Mart\'inez-Ranero, Salcedo, and Utreras, although our definability results are more extensive and undecidability results are much stronger.</description>

      <title>Euclidean algorithms are Gaussian over imaginary quadratic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distributional analysis of Euclidean algorithms was carried out by Baladi and Vall\'{e}e. They showed the asymptotic normality of the number of division steps and associated costs in the Euclidean algorithm as a random variable on the set of rational numbers with bounded denominator based on the transfer operator methods. We extend their result to the Euclidean algorithm over appropriate imaginary quadratic fields by studying dynamics of the nearest integer complex continued fraction map, which is piecewise analytic and expanding but not a full branch map. By observing a finite Markov partition with a regular CW-structure, which enables us to associate the transfer operator acting on a direct sum of spaces of $C^1$-functions, we obtain the limit Gaussian distribution as well as residual equidistribution.</description>

      <title>A family of level-transitive groups with positive fixed-point proportion and positive Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a method to calculate the fixed-point proportion of any iterated wreath product acting on a $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the method applies to a generalization of iterated wreath products acting on a $d$-regular tree, which are not groups. As an application of this generalization, a family of groups of finite type of depth $2$ acting on a $d$-regular tree with $d \geq 3$ and $d \neq 2 \pmod{4}$ is constructed. These groups are self-similar, level-transitive, have positive Hausdorff dimension, and exhibit a positive fixed-point proportion. Unlike other groups with a positive fixed-point proportion known in the literature, the fixed-point proportion of this new family can be calculated explicitly. Furthermore, the iterated Galois group of the polynomial $x^d + 1$ with $d \geq 2$ appears in this family, so its fixed-point proportion is calculated.</description>
