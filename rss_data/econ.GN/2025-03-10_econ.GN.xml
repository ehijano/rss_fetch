      <title>Aggregation Model and Market Mechanism for Virtual Power Plant Participation in Inertia and Primary Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The declining inertia provision from synchronous generators in modern power systems necessitates aggregating distributed ener-gy resources (DERs) into virtual power plants (VPPs) to unlock their potential in delivering inertia and primary frequency re-sponse (IPFR) through ancillary service markets. To facilitate DER participation in the IPFR market, this paper proposes a DER aggregation model and market mechanism for VPP partici-pating in IPFR. First, an energy-IPFR market framework is de-veloped, in which a VPP acts as an intermediary to coordinate heterogeneous DERs. Second, by taking into account the delay associated with inertia, an optimization-based VPP aggregation method is introduced to encapsulate the IPFR process involving a variety of DERs. Third, an energy-IPFR market mechanism with VPP participation is introduced, aiming to minimize social costs while considering the frequency response delay characteristics of the participants. Finally, the performance of the proposed ap-proaches is verified by case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system.</description>

      <title>GATE: An Integrated Assessment Model for AI Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the economic impacts of artificial intelligence requires integrating insights from both computer science and economics. We present the Growth and AI Transition Endogenous model (GATE), a dynamic integrated assessment model that simulates the economic effects of AI automation. GATE combines three key ingredients that have not been brought together in previous work: (1) a compute-based model of AI development, (2) an AI automation framework, and (3) a semi-endogenous growth model featuring endogenous investment and adjustment costs. The model allows users to simulate the economic effects of the transition to advanced AI across a range of potential scenarios. GATE captures the interactions between economic variables, including investment, automation, innovation, and growth, as well as AI-related inputs such as compute and algorithms. This paper explains the model's structure and functionality, emphasizing AI development for economists and economic modeling for the AI community. The model is implemented in an interactive sandbox, enabling users to explore the impact of AI under different parameter choices and policy interventions. The modeling sandbox is available at: www.epoch.ai/GATE.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Biases in AI: ChatGPT's Political Economy Perspectives and Human Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the political and ideological positioning of ChatGPT, a leading large language model (LLM), by comparing its responses to political economy questions from the European Social Survey (ESS). The questions concern environmental sustainability, civil rights, income inequality, and government size. ChatGPT's self-assessed placement on a left-right political spectrum is compared to the ideological stances of individuals providing similar answers in the ESS dataset. Results highlight a significant left-oriented bias in ChatGPT's answers, particularly on environmental and civil rights topics, diverging from its same self-declared center-left stance. These findings underscore the need for transparency in AI systems to prevent potential ideological influences on users. We conclude by discussing the implications for AI governance, debiasing strategies, and educational use.</description>

      <title>Skill and spatial mismatches for sustainable development in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural change is necessary for all countries transitioning to a more environmentally sustainable economy, but what are the likely impacts on workers? Studies often find that green transition scenarios result in net positive job creation numbers overall but rarely provide insights into the more granular dynamics of the labour market. This paper combines a dynamic labour market simulation model with development scenarios focused on agriculture and green manufacturing. We study how, within the context of a green transition, productivity shifts in different sectors and regions, with differing environmental impacts, may affect and be constrained by the labour market in Brazil. By accounting for labour market frictions associated with skill and spatial mismatches, we find that productivity shocks, if not well managed, can exacerbate inequality. Agricultural workers tend to be the most negatively affected as they are less occupationally and geographically mobile. Our results highlight the importance of well-targeted labour market policies to ensure the green transition is just and equitable.</description>

      <title>Maximum Hallucination Standards for Domain-Specific Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate yet credible-sounding content, known as hallucinations. This inherent feature of LLMs poses significant risks, especially in critical domains. I analyze LLMs as a new class of engineering products, treating hallucinations as a product attribute. I demonstrate that, in the presence of imperfect awareness of LLM hallucinations and misinformation externalities, net welfare improves when the maximum acceptable level of LLM hallucinations is designed to vary with two domain-specific factors: the willingness to pay for reduced LLM hallucinations and the marginal damage associated with misinformation.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity in a Spot Gig Work Platform: 2019-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides new evidence on spot gig work platforms for unemployed workers searching for occupations with minimal educational or experience requirements in Japan. Using proprietary data from a private online spot work matching platform, Timee, it examines trends in key variables such as the numbers of unemployed users, vacancies, hires, and labor market tightness. The study compares these trends with part-time worker data from the public employment platform, Hello Work. The private platform shows a significant market expansion from December 2019 to December 2023. Applying a novel nonparametric approach, the paper finds greater variability in efficiency and higher elasticity, with elasticity with respect to the number of users fluctuating from below 0.7 to above 1.5, and elasticity with respect to the number of vacancies often exceeding 1.0, which is higher than Hello Work. Lastly, the study highlights less geographical heterogeneity of the spot work compared to Hello Work.</description>
