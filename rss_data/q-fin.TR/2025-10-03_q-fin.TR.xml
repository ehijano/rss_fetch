      <title>Mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model revisited: a systematic derivation from an exact BBGKY hierarchy for the zero-intelligence limit-order book model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Santa Fe model is an established econophysics model for describing stochastic dynamics of the limit order book from the viewpoint of the zero-intelligence approach. While its foundation was studied by combining a dimensional analysis and a mean-field theory by E. Smith et al. in Quantitative Finance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical foundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic arguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we revisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of kinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We study the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically derive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation. By applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for the order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in conventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed expression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several implications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\mu\to 0$ and $\mu\to \infty$ asymptotics, where $\mu$ is the market-order submission intensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\mu$, while its validity is partially limited for large $\mu$. (2)The ``method of image'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-M\'ezard-Potters in Quantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\mu$, serving as a mathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out an error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant due to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.</description>

      <title>Rolling intrinsic for battery valuation in day-ahead and intraday markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are a cornerstone of the energy transition, as their ability to shift electricity across time enables both grid stability and the integration of renewable generation. This paper investigates the profitability of different market bidding strategies for BESS in the Central European wholesale power market, focusing on the day-ahead auction and intraday trading at EPEX Spot. We employ the rolling intrinsic approach as a realistic trading strategy for continuous intraday markets, explicitly incorporating bid--ask spreads to account for liquidity constraints. Our analysis shows that multi-market bidding strategies consistently outperform single-market participation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that maximum cycle limits significantly affect profitability, indicating that more flexible strategies which relax daily cycling constraints while respecting annual limits can unlock additional value.</description>
