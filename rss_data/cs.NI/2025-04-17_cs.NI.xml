      <title>Beam Misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating beam misalignment in 3GPP mmWave NR systems implementing analog beamforming. Our approach captures the interaction between user mobility, beam sweeping mechanisms, and deployment configurations, focusing on long-term average performance metrics. Specifically, we model the beam misalignment rates at both the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) as Poisson processes and derive expressions for the expected misalignment duration, misalignment fraction, and overall beamforming gain. The framework accounts for practical constraints in NR such as Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB) periodicity, TDD frame structures, and SSB overhead. Through numerical evaluation based on 3GPP mmWave parameters, we identify key trade-offs between beam counts, user mobility, and SSB timing, providing actionable design insights for robust and efficient beam management in future high-frequency networks.</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm of User-Centric Wireless Communication Driven by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of wireless communications seeks to deeply integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with user-centric communication networks, with the goal of developing AI-native networks that more accurately address user requirements. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers significant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that leverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap between human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication systems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication that innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language (NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is the primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user intent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters. Subsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to retrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time database. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization problem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to this optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system to fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider user-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic semantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth to meet user requirements. Additionally, two LLMs are employed to analyze user requests and generate SQL statements, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Communication Optimization for Decentralized Learning atop Bandwidth-limited Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is a promising machine learning paradigm for bringing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to the network edge. Running DFL on top of edge networks, however, faces severe performance challenges due to the extensive parameter exchanges between agents. Most existing solutions for these challenges were based on simplistic communication models, which cannot capture the case of learning over a multi-hop bandwidth-limited network. In this work, we address this problem by jointly designing the communication scheme for the overlay network formed by the agents and the mixing matrix that controls the communication demands between the agents. By carefully analyzing the properties of our problem, we cast each design problem into a tractable optimization and develop an efficient algorithm with guaranteed performance. Our evaluations based on real topology and data show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the total training time by over $80\%$ compared to the baseline without sacrificing accuracy, while significantly improving the computational efficiency over the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Network-Integrated Decoding System for Real-Time Quantum Error Correction with Lattice Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing real-time decoders for surface codes are limited to isolated logical qubits and do not support logical operations involving multiple logical qubits. We present DECONET, a first-of-its-kind decoding system that scales to thousands of logical qubits and supports logical operations implemented through lattice surgery. DECONET organizes compute resources in a network-integrated hybrid tree-grid structure, which results in minimal latency increase and no throughput degradation as the system grows. Specifically, DECONET can be scaled to any arbitrary number of $l$ logical qubits by increasing the compute resources by $O(l \times log(l))$, which provides the required $O(l)$ growth in I/O resources while incurring only an $O(log(l))$ increase in latency-a modest growth that is sufficient for thousands of logical qubits. Moreover, we analytically show that the scaling approach preserves throughput, keeping DECONET backlog-free for any number of logical qubits. We report an exploratory prototype of DECONET, called DECONET/HELIOS, built with five VMK-180 FPGAs, that successfully decodes 100 logical qubits of distance five. For 100 logical qubits, under a phenomenological noise rate of 0.1%, the DECONET/HELIOS has an average latency of 2.40 {\mu}s and an inverse throughput of 0.84 {\mu}s per measurement round.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) from Concept to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is one of the paradigm changes in cybersecurity, from the traditional perimeter-based model to perimeterless. This article studies the core concepts of ZTA, its beginning, a few use cases and future trends. Emphasising the always verify and least privilege access, some key tenets of ZTA have grown to be integration technologies like Identity Management, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and real-time analytics. ZTA is expected to strengthen cloud environments, education, work environments (including from home) while controlling other risks like lateral movement and insider threats. Despite ZTA's benefits, it comes with challenges in the form of complexity, performance overhead and vulnerabilities in the control plane. These require phased implementation and continuous refinement to keep up with evolving organisational needs and threat landscapes. Emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will further automate policy enforcement and threat detection in keeping up with dynamic cyber threats.</description>

      <title>LO2: Microservice API Anomaly Dataset of Logs and Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Microservice-based systems have gained significant attention over the past years. A critical factor for understanding and analyzing the behavior of these systems is the collection of monitoring data such as logs, metrics, and traces. These data modalities can be used for anomaly detection and root cause analysis of failures. In particular, multi-modal methods utilizing several types of this data at once have gained traction in the research community since these three modalities capture different dimensions of system behavior. Aim. We provide a dataset that supports research on anomaly detection and architectural degradation in microservice systems. We generate a comprehensive dataset of logs, metrics, and traces from a production microservice system to enable the exploration of multi-modal fusion methods that integrate multiple data modalities. Method. We dynamically tested the various APIs of the MS-based system, implementing the OAuth2.0 protocol using the Locust tool. For each execution of the prepared test suite, we collect logs and performance metrics for correct and erroneous calls with data labeled according to the error triggered during the call. Contributions. We collected approximately 657,000 individual log files, totaling over two billion log lines. In addition, we collected more than 45 million individual metric files that contain 485 unique metrics. We provide an initial analysis of logs, identify key metrics through PCA, and discuss challenges in collecting traces for this system. Moreover, we highlight the possibilities for making a more fine-grained version of the data set. This work advances anomaly detection in microservice systems using multiple data sources.</description>

      <title>Strategic Client Selection to Address Non-IIDness in HAPS-enabled FL Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of federated learning (FL) in non-terrestrial networks (NTN) that are supported by high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) offers numerous advantages. Due to its large footprint, it facilitates interaction with a large number of line-of-sight (LoS) ground clients, each possessing diverse datasets along with distinct communication and computational capabilities. The presence of many clients enhances the accuracy of the FL model and speeds up convergence. However, the variety of datasets among these clients poses a significant challenge, as it leads to pervasive non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. The data non-IIDness results in markedly reduced training accuracy and slower convergence rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel weighted attribute-based client selection strategy that leverages multiple user-specific attributes, including historical traffic patterns, instantaneous channel conditions, computational capabilities, and previous-round learning performance. By combining these attributes into a composite score for each user at every FL round and selecting users with higher scores as FL clients, the framework ensures more uniform and representative data distributions, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of non-IID data. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed client selection strategy in enhancing FL model accuracy and convergence rate, as well as reducing training loss, by effectively addressing the critical challenge of data non-IIDness in large-scale FL system implementations.</description>

      <title>FODT: Fast, Online, Distributed and Temporary Failure Recovery Approach for MEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) can reduce the latency of cloud computing successfully. However, the edge server may fail due to the hardware of software issues. When the edge server failure happens, the users who offload tasks to this server will be affected. How to recover the services for these affected users quickly and effectively is challenging. Moreover, considering that the server failure is continuous and temporary, and the failed server can be repaired, the previous works cannot handle this problem effectively. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the fast, online, distributed, and temporary failure recovery algorithm (FODT) for MEC. In FODT, when edge sever failure happens, only the affected APs recalculate their user-server allocation strategies and the other APs do not change their strategies. For the affected access points (Aps), the strategies before server failure are reused to reduce complexity and latency. When the failed server is repaired, the influenced APs reuse the strategies before server failure to offload task to this server. Based on this approach, the FODT can achieve better performance than previous works. To the best of knowledge, the FODT is the first failure recovery algorithm, and when compared with previous research, it has higher failure recovery efficiency and lower complexity with acceptable approximate ratio.</description>

      <title>ChaosEater: Fully Automating Chaos Engineering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaos Engineering (CE) is an engineering technique aimed at improving the resiliency of distributed systems. It involves artificially injecting specific failures into a distributed system and observing its behavior in response. Based on the observation, the system can be proactively improved to handle those failures. Recent CE tools implement the automated execution of predefined CE experiments. However, defining these experiments and improving the system based on the experimental results still remain manual. To reduce the costs of the manual operations, we propose ChaosEater, a system for automating the entire CE operations with Large Language Models (LLMs). It predefines the agentic workflow according to a systematic CE cycle and assigns subdivided operations within the workflow to LLMs. ChaosEater targets CE for Kubernetes systems, which are managed through code (i.e., Infrastructure as Code). Therefore, the LLMs in ChaosEater perform software engineering tasks to complete CE cycles, including requirement definition, code generation, debugging, and testing. We evaluate ChaosEater through case studies on both small and large Kubernetes systems. The results demonstrate that it stably completes reasonable single CE cycles with significantly low time and monetary costs. The CE cycles are also qualitatively validated by human engineers and LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent and adaptive cyber defense systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.</description>
