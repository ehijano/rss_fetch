      <title>Deformations of the Riemann hierarchy and the geometry of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann hierarchy is the simplest example of rank one, ($1$+$1$)-dimensional integrable system of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs. It corresponds to the dispersionless limit of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy. In the language of formal variational calculus, we address the classification problem for deformations of the Riemann hierarchy satisfiying different extra requirements (general deformations, defomations as systems of conservation laws, Hamiltonian deformations, and tau-symmetric deformations), under the natural group of coordinate transformations preserving each of those requirements. We present several results linking previous conjectures of Dubrovin--Liu--Yang--Zhang (for the tau-symmetric case) and of Arsie--Lorenzoni--Moro (for systems of conservation laws) to the double ramification hierarchy construction of integrable hierarchies from partial CohFTs and F-CohFTs. We prove that, if the conjectures are true, DR hierarchies of rank one are universal objects in the space of deformations of the Riemann hierarchy. We also prove a weaker version of the DLYZ conjecture and that the ALM conjecture implies (the main part of) the DLYZ conjecture. Finally we characterize those rank one F-CohFTs which give rise to Hamiltonian deformations of the Riemann hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Solvable Structures for Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate solvable structures associated to Hamiltonian equations. For a completely integrable Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom, we construct a canonical solvable structure consisting of $2n$ Hamiltonian vector fields. We derive explicit expressions for the corresponding Pfaffian forms, whose integration provides solutions to the Hamiltonian equations. We show that the upper $n$ forms give the action varibles, while the lower $n$ forms yield the angle variables of the system. This offers a novel interpretation of the Arnold--Liouville theorem in terms of solvable structures. We ilustrate the theory by deriving explicit solutions and action--angle variables for $n$ harmonic oscillators and the Calogero--Moser system.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymmetry via pseudodifferential projections: the massless Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on closed manifolds was proposed in a recent series of papers by the first author and collaborator. They showed that information on spectral asymmetry can be encoded within and recovered from a negative order pseudodifferential operator -- the asymmetry operator -- constructed from appropriately defined pseudodifferential (spectral) projections. In this manuscript we apply these techniques to the study of the massless Dirac operator; in particular, we compute the principal symbol of the asymmetry operator, accounting for the underlying gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>The Spear and the Ring: Emergent Structures in Magnetic Colloidal Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study from a mathematical point of view the nanoparticle model of a magnetic colloid, presented by G. Klughertz. Our objective is to obtain properties of stable stationary structures that arise in the long-time limit for the magnetic nanoparticles dynamics following this model. In this article, we present a detailed study of two specific structures using techniques from the calculus of variations. The first, called the spear, consists of a chain of aligned particles interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential. We establish existence and uniqueness results, derive bounds on the distances between neighboring particles, and provide a sharp asymptotic description as the number of particles tends to infinity. The second structure, the ring, features particles uniformly distributed along a circle. We prove its existence and uniqueness and derive an explicit formula for its radius.</description>

      <title>Twisted Baker-Akhiezer function from determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General description of eigenfunctions of integrable Hamiltonians associated with the integer rays of Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra, is provided by the theory of Chalykh Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAF) defined as solutions to a simply looking linear system. Solutions themselves are somewhat complicated, but much simpler than they could. It is because of simultaneous partial factorization of all the determinants, entering Cramer's rule. This is a conspiracy responsible for a relative simplicity of the Macdonald polynomials and of the Noumi-Shirashi functions, and it is further continued to all integer DIM rays. Still, factorization is only partial, moreover, there are different branches and abrupt jumps between them. We explain this feature of Cramer's rule in an example of a matrix that defines BAF and exhibits a non-analytical dependence on parameters. Moreover, the matrix is such that there is no natural expansion around non-degenerate approximations, which causes an unexpected complexity of formulas.</description>

      <title>Braided Majorana qubits as a minimal setting for Topological Quantum Computation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I point out that a possible minimal setting to realize Kitaev's proposal of a Topological Quantum Computation which offers topological protection from decoherence could in principle be realized by braided Majorana qubits. Majorana qubits and their braiding were introduced in Nucl. Phys. B 980, 115834 (2022) and further analyzed in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 435203 (2024). Braided Majorana qubits implement a Gentile-type parastatistics with at most $s-1$ excited states accommodated in a multiparticle sector (the integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$ labels quantum group reps at roots of unity). It is argued that braided Majorana qubits could play, for topological quantum computers, the same role as standard bits for ordinary computers and as qubits for "ordinary" quantum computers.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation in a gravity field for Maxwell molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we consider the linear inelastic Boltzmann equation in presence of a uniform and fixed gravity field, in the case of Maxwell molecules. We first obtain a well-posedness result in the space of finite, non-negative Radon measures. In addition, we rigorously prove the existence of a stationary solution under the non-equilibrium condition which is induced by the presence of the external field. We further show that this stationary solution is unique in the class of the finite, non-negative Radon measures with finite first order moment, and that all the solutions in this class converge towards the stationary solution in the weak topology of the measures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Clustering of Conditional Mutual Information via Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional mutual information (CMI) has recently attracted significant attention as a key quantity for characterizing quantum correlations in many-body systems. While it is conjectured that CMI decays rapidly in finite-temperature Gibbs states, a complete and general proof remains elusive. Previous work addressed this problem in the high-temperature regime using cluster expansion techniques [T. Kuwahara, K. Kato, F.G.S.L. Brand\~ao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 220601 (2020)]; however, flaws in the proof have been pointed out, and the method does not provide a uniformly convergent expansion at arbitrarily high temperatures. In this work, we demonstrate that the cluster expansion approach indeed fails to converge absolutely, even at any high-temperatures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach to proving the spatial decay of CMI. Our method leverages the connection between CMI and quantum recovery maps, specifically utilizing the Fawzi-Renner theorem. We show that such recovery maps can be realized through dissipative dynamics, and by analyzing the locality properties of these dynamics, we establish the exponential decay of CMI in high-temperature regimes. As a technical contribution, we also present a new result on the perturbative stability of quasi-local Liouvillian dynamics. Our results indicate that, contrary to common intuition, high-temperature Gibbs states can exhibit nontrivial mathematical structure, particularly when multipartite correlations such as CMI are considered.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results for timelike Liouville field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouville field theory has long been a cornerstone of two-dimensional quantum field theory and quantum gravity, which has attracted much recent attention in the mathematics literature. Timelike Liouville field theory is a version of Liouville field theory where the kinetic term in the action appears with a negative sign, which makes it closer to a theory of quantum gravity than ordinary (spacelike) Liouville field theory. Making sense of this "wrong sign" requires a theory of Gaussian random variables with negative variance. Such a theory is developed in this paper, and is used to prove the timelike DOZZ formula for the $3$-point correlation function when the parameters satisfy the so-called "charge neutrality condition". Expressions are derived also for the $k$-point correlation functions for all $k\ge 3$, and it is shown that these functions approach the correct semiclassical limits as the coupling constant is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and mathematically simple. Our work provides new insight into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to quantizing Markov chains. The approach is based on the Markov chain coupling method, which is frequently used to prove fast mixing. Given a particular coupling, e.g., a grand coupling, we construct a completely positive and trace preserving map. This quantum map has a unique fixed point, which corresponds to the quantum sample (qsample) of the classical Markov chain's stationary distribution. We show that the convergence time of the quantum map is directly related to the coupling time of the Markov chain coupling.</description>

      <title>Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations as Electrostatic Equilibria: A Generalized Thomson Problem in Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variational framework in which Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVTs) arise as local minimizers of a generalized electrostatic energy functional. By modeling interior point distributions in a convex domain as repelling charges balanced against a continuous boundary charge, we show that the resulting equilibrium configurations converge to CVT structures. We prove this by showing that CVTs minimize both the classical centroidal energy and the electrostatic potential, establishing a connection between geometric quantization and potential theory. Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic annealing scheme for global CVT optimization, rooted in Boltzmann statistics and random walk dynamics. By introducing a scheme for varying time steps (faster or slower cooling) we show that the set of minima of the centroid energy functional (and therefore the electrostatic potential) can be recovered. By recovering a set of generator locations corresponding to each minimum we can create a lattice continuation that allows for a customizable framework for individual minimum seeking.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</description>

      <title>Sharp connectivity bounds for the vacant set of random interlacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider percolation of the vacant set of random interlacements at intensity $u$ in dimensions three and higher, and derive lower bounds on the truncated two-point function for all values of $u&gt;0$. These bounds are sharp up to principal exponential order for all $u$ in dimension three and all $u \neq u_\ast$ in higher dimensions, where $u_*$ refers to the critical parameter of the model, and they match the upper bounds derived in the article arXiv:2503.14497. In dimension three, our results further imply that the truncated two-point function grows at large distances $x$ at a rate that depends on $x$ only through its Euclidean norm, which offers a glimpse of the expected (Euclidean) invariance of the scaling limit at criticality. The rate function is atypical, it incurs a logarithmic correction and comes with an explicit pre-factor that converges to $0$ as the parameter $u$ approaches the critical point $u_*$ from either side. A particular challenge stems from the combined effects of lack of monotonicity due to the truncation in the super-critical phase, and the precise (rotationally invariant) controls we seek, that measure the effects of a certain "harmonic humpback" function. Among others, their derivation relies on rather fine estimates for hitting probabilities of the random walk in arbitrary direction $e$, which witness this invariance at the discrete level, and preclude straightforward applications of projection arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of grand angular momentum is widely used in the study of N-body problems quantum mechanically. Here, we applied it to a classical analysis of N-body problems. Utilizing the tree representation for Jacobi and hyperspherical coordinates, we found a decomposition of its magnitude into magnitudes of one-body angular momenta in three dimensions. We generalized some results from the two-body case and derived a general expression for the scattering angle in N-body problems.</description>

      <title>The torus plateau for the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus of volume $r^d$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$ and for large $r$, in the vicinity of the infinite-volume critical point $\beta_c$. We prove that for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ (with a suitable constant) the susceptibility is bounded above and below by multiples of $r^{d/2}$. Additionally, again for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$, the two-point function has a ``plateau'': it decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ when $|x|$ is small relative to the volume, but for larger $|x|$, it levels off to a constant value of order $r^{-d/2}$. We also prove that at $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ the renormalised coupling constant is nonzero, which implies a non-Gaussian limit for the average spin. The proof relies on near-critical estimates for the infinite-volume two-point function obtained recently by Duminil-Copin and Panis, and builds upon a strategy proposed by Papathanakos. The random current representation of the Ising model plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

      <title>Moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of unitary matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda_X(s)=\det(I-sX^{\dagger})$ be the characteristic polynomial of a Haar distributed unitary matrix $X$. It is believed that the distribution of values of $\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular interest is the behavior of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros (all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present several identities for the moments of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for $s \in \mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|s|=1$. Additionally, we prove, for positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k} \mathrm{dX}$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\int_{U(N)} |\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} \mathrm{dX}$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio, $f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$ is prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a second order non-linear Painl\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give some formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in the simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the zeros of $\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of Timoshenko beam, the material parameters are inherently prescribed on the material moving frame. In this regard, we derive the strong and weak formulations of the dynamics under finite transformation in Lagrangian coordinates. Accordingly, analytical mechanics tools are used to deduce a new Hamiltonian formulation of the model which proves to be remarkably simple and synthetic.</description>

      <title>Free cumulants and freeness for unitarily invariant random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of the asymptotic description of random tensors that are local-unitary invariant, that is, invariant by conjugation by tensor products of independent unitary matrices. We consider both the mixed case of a tensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a factorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the random tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.
  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of certain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to relabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the expectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size moment-cumulants formulas.
  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that scale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a Wishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants associated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas involving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases involve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the distribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a sum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary discussion of higher orders is provided.
  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order tensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic moments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic construction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative probability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of these spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor freeness of the subspaces they generate.</description>

      <title>Loop group methods for the non-abelian Hodge correspondence on a 4-punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-abelian Hodge correspondence is a real analytic map between the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles and the deRham moduli space of irreducible flat connections mediated by solutions to the self-duality equations. In this paper we construct self-duality solutions for strongly parabolic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb C)$ Higgs fields on a $4$-punctured sphere with parabolic weights $t \sim 0$ using complex analytic methods. We identify the rescaled limit hyper-K\"ahler moduli space $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ to be the completion of the nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)$ modulo a $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ action, equipped with the Eguchi-Hanson metric. Our methods and computations are based on the twistor approach to the self-duality equations using Deligne and Simpson's $\lambda$-connections interpretation. By construction we can compute the Taylor expansions of the holomorphic symplectic form $\varpi_t$ on $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ which turn out to have closed form expressions in terms of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs). The geometric properties of $\mathcal M_t$ lead to some identities of certain MPLs which we believe deserve further investigations.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entropies for one-dimensional quantum systems with mixed boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general method for calculating R\'enyi entropies in the ground state of a one-dimensional critical system with mixed open boundaries, for an interval starting at one of its ends. In the conformal field theory framework, this computation boils down to the evaluation of the correlation function of one twist field and two boundary condition changing operators in the cyclic orbifold. Exploiting null-vectors of the cyclic orbifold, we derive ordinary differential equations satisfied by these correlation functions. In particular, we obtain an explicit expression for the second R\'enyi entropy valid for any diagonal minimal model, but with a particular set of mixed boundary conditions. In order to compare our results with numerical data for the Ising and three-state Potts critical chains, we also identify and compute the leading finite size corrections.</description>

      <title>The free energy of the large-$N$ fermionic Chern$\small-$Simons theory in the 'temporal' gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the computational evidence for the Bose$\small-$Fermi duality of fundamental fields coupled to $U(N)$ Chern$\small-$Simons theories originates in large-$N$ calculations performed in the light-cone gauge. This gauge is ill-suited to computations in curved spacetimes, like the evaluation of the partition function on $\Sigma_g\times S^1$ for arbitrary genus $g$. In this paper, we use another gauge, the 'temporal' gauge, to set up the computation of this partition function. In the large-$N$ limit, and the special case $\Sigma_g=\mathbb{R}^2$, we take the computation through to the end by setting up and solving the gap equations, generalizing tricks explored in arXiv:1410.0558 to finite temperature. Our final results are in perfect agreement with earlier light-cone gauge results, providing a consistency check of both the formalism developed in this paper as well as previously performed light-cone gauge computations. In a follow-up paper, we will report on using our formalism to explicitly compute the partition function on $S^2 \times S^1$ for a finite-sized sphere.</description>

      <title>The dynamical $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length $ L $, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0 &lt; \alpha \le 1 $, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. This result arises from a general relation among dynamical $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and Lieb-Robinson bounds. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of $\alpha$ close enough to $ 1 $. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial pure states with low entanglement of $ O(\log L) $. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. We establish that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order $ \log L $. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on $ \alpha $-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed decomposition of Wigner's particles, defined as unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\'e group, in terms of unitary representations of its Lorentz subgroup. As pointed out before us, this decomposition only involves Lorentz representations belonging to the principal continuous series, and further underpins the connection between scattering amplitudes and conformal correlation functions discussed in the context of celestial holography. We provide very explicit formulae for the decomposition of particles of arbitrary mass and (half-)integer spin and for any spacetime dimension. We emphasise that this decomposition is unique and comes with a specific inner product on the corresponding Hilbert space. We also confirm that unitary translations mix Lorentz representations within the principal continuous series only, as required. Implications to the celestial holography program are indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate integrals of non-holomorphic modular functions over the fundamental domain of the torus with modular parameter $\tau$ analytically. It proceeds in two steps: first the integral is transformed to a Lorentzian contour by the same strategy that leads to the Lorentzian inversion formula in CFT, and then we apply a two-dimensional version of the Rademacher expansion. This computes the integral in terms of an expansion sensitive to the singular behaviour of the integrand near all the Lorentzian cusps $\tau \to i \infty$, $\bar{\tau} \to x \in \mathbb{Q}$. We apply this technique to a variety of examples such as the evaluation of string one-loop partition functions, where it leads to the first analytic formula for the cosmological constants of the bosonic string and the $\mathrm{SO}(16) \times \mathrm{SO}(16)$ string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors (featuring ideal fluids, scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic fields), independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>A new non-autonomous version of Hirota's discrete KdV equation and its discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV (dKdV) equation is an integrable autonomous partial difference equation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that reduces to the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in a continuum limit. In this paper, we introduce a new non-autonomous version of the dKdV equation. Furthermore, we show that the new equation is integrable and admits discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions described by $q$-Painlev\'e equations of $A_J^{(1)}$-surface types ($J=3,4,5,6$).</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Refinement Transform: A Novel Uncountably Infinite Transform Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel and general class of continuous transforms based on hierarchical Voronoi based refinement schemes. The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle. Despite the complexity of the underlying geometry, the coefficient spectrum reveals structure, offering insight even in highly irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>
