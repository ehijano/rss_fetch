      <title>Streamer-like red line diffuse auroras driven by time domain structures and ECH waves associated with a plasma injection and braking ion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auroral streamers are important meso-scale processes of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, typically studied using imagers sensitive to energetic (&gt;1 keV) electron precipitation, such as all-sky imagers (ASIs). This paper reports streamer-like red-line auroras, representing low-energy (&lt;1 keV) precipitation, observed poleward of a black aurora and an auroral torch. These red-line auroras were associated with a magnetospheric electron injection and braking ion flows. Observations were made using the THEMIS spacecraft and ground-based imagers, including the ASI, REGO, and meridian scanning photometer (MSP) at Fort Smith. We identify plasma sheet electron pitch-angle scattering by time-domain structures (TDSs) and electron cyclotron harmonics (ECH) waves as the driver of these red-line auroras, because of (1) a strong correlation (~0.9) between observed red-line intensities and precipitating fluxes; (2) consistent red-line intensities from auroral transport code forward modeling, and (3) consistent precipitation characteristic energies from MSP optical inference and quasi-linear estimates.</description>

      <title>Disparities in Magnetic Cloud Observations Between Two Spacecraft Having Small Radial and Angular Separations Near 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18919</link>

Abstract: Studies for inferring the global characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from its multipoint local in situ observations have been undertaken earlier, but there are limited studies utilizing measurements from multiple spacecraft with sufficiently small radial and angular separations. In the present study, we investigate a magnetic cloud (MC) region of a CME observed in situ during 2023 September 24-26, at STEREO-A and Wind spacecraft near 1 AU, which had radial and angular separations of 0.03 AU and 3.4 degrees, respectively. We examine the disparities in the estimates of the arrival times of CME substructures, the MC axis, and its orientation between the two spacecraft. We also propose an approach for identifying the MC axis's arrival and have compared it with the arrival of the size/time center to understand the non-isotropic compression of the MC along its angular extent. Using minimum variance analysis (MVA), we note that the orientation of the MC is slightly out-of-ecliptic at Wind but not at STEREO-A. We also compare the magnetic field parameters over the start to end of the MC at both spacecraft and note a significant non-coherency in the MC towards its trailing portion. Our analysis confirms that MC has a stronger rear side compression at STEREO-A than at Wind, with its trailing edge arriving later at Wind. Our study highlights substantial differences in CME characteristics even at mesoscales across the angular extent, and therefore, one needs to analyze several such cases to better understand the flux rope structure.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of solar eruption, extreme-ultraviolet wave propagation, and wave-induced prominence dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of a horizontal extent of 1100 Mm, while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source \texttt{MPI-AMRVAC 3.1} code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form a flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasi-circular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing the equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors: the fast EUV wave slightly decelerates as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence-hosting flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</description>
