      <title>Branch-and-Cut for Computing Approximate Equilibria of Mixed-Integer Generalized Nash Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables constitute an important class of games in which each player solves a mixed-integer optimization problem, where both the objective and the feasible set is parameterized by the rivals' strategies. However, such games are known for failing to admit exact equilibria and also the assumption of all players being able to solve nonconvex problems to global optimality is questionable. This motivates the study of approximate equilibria. In this work, we consider an approximation concept that incorporates both multiplicative and additive relaxations of optimality. We propose a branch-and-cut (B&amp;C) method that computes such approximate equilibria or proves its non-existence. For this, we adopt the idea of intersection cuts and show the existence of such cuts under the condition that the constraints are linear and each player's cost function is either convex in the entire strategy profile, or, concave in the entire strategy profile and linear in the rivals' strategies. For the special case of standard Nash equilibrium problems, we introduce an alternative type of cut and show that the method terminates finitely, provided that each player has only finitely many distinct best-response sets. Finally, on the basis of the B&amp;C method, we introduce a single-tree binary-search method to compute best-approximate equilibria under some simplifying assumptions. We implemented these methods and present numerical results for a class of mixed-integer flow games.</description>

      <title>Non-Monotonicity in Fair Division of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating the vertices of a graph among $n$ agents, where the value of a bundle is determined by its cut value -- the number of edges with exactly one endpoint in the bundle. This model naturally captures applications such as team formation and network partitioning, where valuations are inherently non-monotonic: the marginal values may be positive, negative, or zero depending on the composition of the bundle. We focus on the fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and explore its compatibility with several efficiency concepts such as Transfer Stability (TS) that prohibits single-item transfers that benefit one agent without making the other worse-off. For general graphs, our results uncover a non-monotonic relationship between the number of agents $n$ and the existence of allocations satisfying EF1 and transfer stability (TS): such allocations always exist for $n=2$, may fail to exist for $n=3$, but exist again for all $n\geq 4$. We further show that existence can be guaranteed for any $n$ by slightly weakening the efficiency requirement or by restricting the graph to forests. All of our positive results are achieved via efficient algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fair and consistent extensions of the Shapley value for games with externalities. Based on the restriction identified by Casajus et al. (2024, Games Econ. Behavior 147, 88-146), we define balanced contributions, Sobolev's consistency, and Hart and Mas-Colell's consistency for games with externalities, and we show that these properties lead to characterizations of the generalization of the Shapley value introduced by Macho-Stadler et al. (2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339-356), that parallel important characterizations of the Shapley value.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Dynamics in Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games - Part II: Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic game with a large population of players who choose actions from a finite set in continuous time. Each player has a state in a finite state space that evolves stochastically with their actions. A player's reward depends not only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states and actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in traffic networks. In Part I, we introduced an evolutionary model and a new solution concept - the mixed stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which coincides with the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model under meaningful families of revision protocols. In this second part, we investigate the evolutionary stability of MSNE. We derive conditions on both the structure of the MSNE and the game's payoff map that ensure local and global stability under evolutionary dynamics. These results characterize when MSNE can robustly emerge and persist against strategic deviations, thereby providing insight into its long-term viability in large population dynamic games.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Fixed-Price Bilateral Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine fixed-price mechanisms in bilateral trade through the lens of regret minimization. Our main results are twofold. (i) For independent values, a near-optimal $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{2/3})$ tight bound for $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ fixed-price mechanisms with two-bit/one-bit feedback. (ii) For correlated/adversarial values, a near-optimal $\Omega(T^{3/4})$ lower bound for $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ fixed-price mechanisms with two-bit/one-bit feedback, which improves the best known $\Omega(T^{5/7})$ lower bound obtained in the work [BCCF24] and, up to polylogarithmic factors, matches the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3 / 4})$ upper bound obtained in the same work. Our work in combination with the previous works [CCCFL24mor, CCCFL24jmlr, AFF24, BCCF24] (essentially) gives a thorough understanding of regret minimization for fixed-price bilateral trade.
  En route, we have developed two technical ingredients that might be of independent interest: (i) A novel algorithmic paradigm, called $\textit{{fractal elimination}}$, to address one-bit feedback and independent values. (ii) A new $\textit{lower-bound construction}$ with novel proof techniques, to address the $\textsf{Global Budget Balance}$ constraint and correlated values.</description>

      <title>Nash Social Welfare with Submodular Valuations: Approximation Algorithms and Integrality Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of allocating items to agents with submodular valuations with the goal of maximizing the weighted Nash social welfare (NSW). The best-known results for unweighted and weighted objectives are the $(4+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Garg, Husic, Li, V\'egh, and Vondr\'ak~[STOC 2023] and the $(233+\epsilon)$ approximation given by Feng, Hu, Li, and Zhang~[STOC 2025], respectively.
  In this work, we present a $(3.56+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for weighted NSW maximization with submodular valuations, simultaneously improving the previous approximation ratios of both the weighted and unweighted NSW problems. Our algorithm solves the configuration LP of Feng, Hu, Li, and Zhang~[STOC 2025] via a stronger separation oracle that loses an $e/(e-1)$ factor only on small items, and then rounds the solution via a new bipartite multigraph construction. Some key technical ingredients of our analysis include a greedy proxy function, additive within each configuration, that preserves the LP value while lower-bounding the rounded solution, together with refined concentration bounds and a series of mathematical programs analyzed partly by computer assistance.
  On the hardness side, we prove that the configuration LP for weighted NSW with submodular valuations has an integrality gap of at least $(2^{\ln 2}-\epsilon) \approx 1.617 - \epsilon$, which is larger than the current best-known $e/(e-1)-\epsilon \approx 1.582-\epsilon$ hardness~[SODA 2020]. For additive valuations, we show an integrality gap of $(e^{1/e}-\epsilon)$, which proves the tightness of the approximation ratio in~[ICALP 2024] for algorithms based on the configuration LP. For unweighted NSW with additive valuations, we show an integrality gap of $(2^{1/4}-\epsilon) \approx 1.189-\epsilon$, again larger than the current best-known $\sqrt{8/7} \approx 1.069$-hardness~[Math. Oper. Res. 2024].</description>

      <title>Introspectively Envy-Free and Efficient Allocation of Indivisible Mixed Manna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of allocations that are fair and efficient, simultaneously, is a central inquiry in fair division literature. A prominent result in discrete fair division shows that the complementary desiderata of fairness and efficiency can be achieved together when allocating indivisible items with nonnegative values; specifically, for indivisible goods and among agents with additive valuations, there always exists an allocation that is both envy-free up to one item (EF1) and Pareto efficient (PO). While a recent breakthrough extends the EF1 and PO guarantee to indivisible chores (items with negative values), the question remains open for indivisible mixed manna, i.e., for indivisible items whose values can be positive, negative, or zero. The current work makes notable progress in resolving this central question.
  For indivisible mixed manna and additive valuations, we establish the existence of allocations that are PO and introspectively envy-free up to one item (IEF1). In an IEF1 allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our result generalizes the aforementioned existence guarantee for chores. Our techniques can be adopted to obtain an alternative proof for the existence of EF1 and PO allocations of indivisible goods. Hence, along with the result for mixed manna, we provide a unified approach for establishing the EF1 and PO guarantee for indivisible goods and indivisible chores. We also utilize our result for indivisible items to develop a distinct proof of the noted EF and PO guarantee for divisible mixed manna. Our work highlights an interesting application of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division and develops multiple, novel structural insights and algorithmic ideas.</description>

      <title>Optimal Allocations under Strongly Pigou-Dalton Criteria: Hidden Layer Structure &amp; Efficient Combinatorial Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate optimal social welfare allocations of $m$ items to $n$ agents with binary additive or submodular valuations. For binary additive valuations, we prove that the set of optimal allocations coincides with the set of so-called \emph{stable allocations}, as long as the employed criterion for evaluating social welfare is strongly Pigou-Dalton (SPD) and symmetric. Many common criteria are SPD and symmetric, such as Nash social welfare, leximax, leximin, Gini index, entropy, and envy sum. We also design efficient algorithms for finding a stable allocation, including an $O(m^2n)$ time algorithm for the case of indivisible items, and an $O(m^2n^5)$ time one for the case of divisible items. The first is faster than the existing algorithms or has a simpler analysis. The latter is the first combinatorial algorithm for that problem. It utilizes a hidden layer partition of items and agents admitted by all stable allocations, and cleverly reduces the case of divisible items to the case of indivisible items.
  In addition, we show that the profiles of different optimal allocations have a small Chebyshev distance, which is 0 for the case of divisible items under binary additive valuations, and is at most 1 for the case of indivisible items under binary submodular valuations.</description>

      <title>Proximal Regret and Proximal Correlated Equilibria: A New Tractable Solution Concept for Online Learning and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning and computation of equilibria are central problems in game theory, theory of computation, and artificial intelligence. In this work, we introduce proximal regret, a new notion of regret based on proximal operators that lies strictly between external and swap regret. When every player employs a no-proximal-regret algorithm in a general convex game, the empirical distribution of play converges to proximal correlated equilibria (PCE), a refinement of coarse correlated equilibria. Our framework unifies several emerging notions in online learning and game theory-such as gradient equilibrium and semicoarse correlated equilibrium-and introduces new ones. Our main result shows that the classic Online Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm achieves an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound on proximal regret, revealing that GD, without modification, minimizes a stronger regret notion than external regret. This provides a new explanation for the empirically superior performance of gradient descent in online learning and games. We further extend our analysis to Mirror Descent in the Bregman setting and to Optimistic Gradient Descent, which yields faster convergence in smooth convex games.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Collaboration with Misaligned Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-life settings, algorithms play the role of assistants, while humans ultimately make the final decision. Often, algorithms specifically act as curators, narrowing down a wide range of options into a smaller subset that the human picks between: consider content recommendation or chatbot responses to questions with multiple valid answers. Crucially, humans may not know their own preferences perfectly either, but instead may only have access to a noisy sampling over preferences. Algorithms can assist humans by curating a smaller subset of items, but must also face the challenge of misalignment: humans may have different preferences from each other (and from the algorithm), and the algorithm may not know the exact preferences of the human they are facing at any point in time. In this paper, we model and theoretically study such a setting. Specifically, we show instances where humans benefit by collaborating with a misaligned algorithm. Surprisingly, we show that humans gain more utility from a misaligned algorithm (which makes different mistakes) than from an aligned algorithm. Next, we build on this result by studying what properties of algorithms maximize human welfare when the goals could be either utilitarian welfare or ensuring all humans benefit. We conclude by discussing implications for designers of algorithmic tools and policymakers.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Variational Inequalities under the Minty Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving variational inequalities (SVIs) is a foundational problem at the heart of optimization. However, this expressivity comes at the cost of computational hardness. As a result, most research has focused on carving out specific subclasses that elude those intractability barriers. A classical property that goes back to the 1960s is the Minty condition, which postulates that the Minty VI (MVI) problem admits a solution.
  In this paper, we establish the first polynomial-time algorithm -- that is, with complexity growing polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\log(1/\epsilon)$ -- for solving $\epsilon$-SVIs for Lipschitz continuous mappings under the Minty condition. Prior approaches either incurred an exponentially worse dependence on $1/\epsilon$ or made restrictive assumptions. To do so, we introduce a new variant of the ellipsoid algorithm whereby separating hyperplanes are obtained after taking a gradient descent step from the center of the ellipsoid. It succeeds even though the set of SVIs can be nonconvex and not fully dimensional. Moreover, when our algorithm is applied to an instance with no MVI solution and fails to identify an SVI solution, it produces a succinct certificate of MVI infeasibility. We also show that deciding whether the Minty condition holds is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete, thereby establishing that the disjunction of those two problems is polynomial-time solvable even though each problem is individually intractable.
  We provide several extensions and new applications of our main results. Most notably, we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithms for i) globally minimizing a (potentially nonsmooth) quasar-convex function, and ii) computing Nash equilibria in multi-player harmonic games. Finally, in two-player general-sum concave games, we give the first polynomial-time algorithm that outputs either a Nash equilibrium or a strict coarse correlated equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Edge-weighted Online Stochastic Matching Under Jaillet-Lu LP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The online stochastic matching problem was introduced by [FMMM09], together with the $(1-\frac1e)$-competitive Suggested Matching algorithm. In the most general edge-weighted setting, this ratio has not been improved for more than one decade, until recently [Yan24] beat the $1-\frac1e$ bound and [QFZW23] further improved it to $0.650$. Both works measure the online competitiveness against the offline LP relaxation introduced by Jaillet and Lu [JL14]. The same LP has also played an important role in other settings as it is a natural choice for two-choice online algorithms.
  In this paper, we prove an upper bound of $0.663$ and a lower bound of $0.662$ for edge-weighted online stochastic matching under Jaillet-Lu LP. We propose a simple hard instance and identify the optimal online algorithm for this specific instance which has a competitive ratio of $&lt;0.663$. Despite the simplicity of the instance, we then show that a near-optimal algorithm for it, which has a competitive ratio of $&gt;0.662$, can be generalized to work on all instances without any loss.
  As our algorithm is generalized from a real near-optimal algorithm instead of manually combining trivial strategies, it has two natural advantages compared with previous works: (1) its matching strategy varies from time to time; (2) it utilizes global information about offline vertices. On the other hand, the upper bound suggests that more powerful LPs and multiple-choice strategies are needed if we want to further improve the ratio by $&gt;0.001$.</description>
