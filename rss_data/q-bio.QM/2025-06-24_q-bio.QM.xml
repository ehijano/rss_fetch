      <title>Single-Cell Proteomic Technologies: Tools in the quest for principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, proteomic analysis of single cells by mass spectrometry transitioned from an uncertain possibility to a set of robust and rapidly advancing technologies supporting the accurate quantification of thousands of proteins. We review the major drivers of this progress, from establishing feasibility to powerful and increasingly scalable methods. We focus on the tradeoffs and synergies of different technological solutions within a coherent conceptual framework, which projects considerable room both for throughput scaling and for extending the analysis scope to functional protein measurements. We highlight the potential of these technologies to support the development of mechanistic biophysical models and help uncover new principles.</description>

      <title>BrainSymphony: A Transformer-Driven Fusion of fMRI Time Series and Structural Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful, modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification, prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration). BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and powerful research in computational neuroscience.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Neighborhood Enrichment Score for Spatial Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neighborhood enrichment test is used to quantify spatial enrichment and depletion between spatial points with categorical labels, which is a common data type in spatial omics. Traditionally, this test relies on a permutation-based Monte Carlo approach, which tends to be computationally expensive for large datasets. In this study, we present a modified version of the test that can be computed analytically. This analytical version showed a minimum Pearson correlation of 0.95 with the conventional Monte Carlo-based method across eight spatial omics datasets, but with substantial speed-ups. Additional experiments on a large Xenium dataset demonstrated the method's ability to efficiently analyze large-scale data, making it a valuable tool for analyzing spatial omics data.</description>

      <title>AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>A practical identifiability criterion leveraging weak-form parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we define a practical identifiability criterion, (e, q)-identifiability, based on a parameter e, reflecting the noise in observed variables, and a parameter q, reflecting the mean-square error of the parameter estimator. This criterion is better able to encompass changes in the quality of the parameter estimate due to increased noise in the data (compared to existing criteria based solely on average relative errors). Furthermore, we leverage a weak-form equation error-based method of parameter estimation for systems with unobserved variables to assess practical identifiability far more quickly in comparison to output error-based parameter estimation. We do so by generating weak-form input-output equations using differential algebra techniques, as previously proposed by Boulier et al [1], and then applying Weak form Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamics (WENDy) to obtain parameter estimates. This method is computationally efficient and robust to noise, as demonstrated through two classical biological modelling examples.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Grad-CAM Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Virtual Screening (VS) has become an essential tool in drug discovery, enabling the rapid and cost-effective identification of potential bioactive molecules. Among recent advancements, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to model complex molecular structures using graph-based representations. However, the integration of explainable methods to elucidate the specific contributions of molecular substructures to biological activity remains a significant challenge. This limitation hampers both the interpretability of predictive models and the rational design of novel therapeutics. Results: We trained 20 GNN models on a dataset of small molecules with the goal of predicting their activity on 20 distinct protein targets from the Kinase family. These classifiers achieved state-of-the-art performance in virtual screening tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness on different targets. Building upon these models, we implemented the Hierarchical Grad-CAM graph Explainer (HGE) framework, enabling an in-depth analysis of the molecular moieties driving protein-ligand binding stabilization. HGE exploits Grad-CAM explanations at the atom, ring, and whole-molecule levels, leveraging the message-passing mechanism to highlight the most relevant chemical moieties. Validation against experimental data from the literature confirmed the ability of the explainer to recognize a molecular pattern of drugs and correctly annotate them to the known target. Conclusion: Our approach may represent a valid support to shorten both the screening and the hit discovery process. Detailed knowledge of the molecular substructures that play a role in the binding process can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the structure optimization, as well as in drug repurposing tasks.</description>

      <title>Multilevel classification framework for breast cancer cell selection and its integration with advanced disease models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms, enabling drug discovery, and developing personalized treatments, yet their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges in model selection and data reproducibility. This review aims at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the features of breast cancer types and commercially available human breast cancer cell lines, defining absolute criteria, i.e. objective features such as origin (e.g., MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and relative criteria, which contextualize functional behaviors like metastatic potential, drug sensitivity, and genomic instability. It then examines how the proposed framework could be applied to cell line screening in advanced and emerging disease models. By supporting better informed choices, this work aims to improve experimental design and strengthen the connection between in vitro breast cancer studies and their clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Modelling collective cell migration in a data-rich age: challenges and opportunities for data-driven modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling has a long history in the context of collective cell migration, with applications throughout development, disease and regenerative medicine. The aim of modelling in this context is to provide a framework in which to mathematically encode experimentally derived mechanistic hypotheses, and then to test and validate them to provide new insights and understanding. Traditionally, mathematical models have consisted of systems of partial differential equations that model the evolution of cell density over time, together with the dynamics of any associated biochemical signals or the underlying substrate. The various terms in the model are usually chosen to provide simplified, phenomenological descriptions of the underlying biology, and follow long-standing conventions in the field. However, with the recent development of a plethora of new experimental technologies that provide quantitative data on collective cell migration processes, we now have the opportunity to leverage statistical and machine learning tools to determine mathematical models directly from the data. This perspectives article aims to provide an overview of recently developed data-driven modelling approaches, outlining the main methodologies and the challenges involved in using them to interrogate real-world data relating to collective cell migration.</description>

      <title>Anatomical basis of sex differences in the electrocardiogram identified by three-dimensional torso-heart imaging reconstruction pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomy features. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. For post-MI women, the heart is positioned more posteriorly and vertically, than in men (with healthy women yet more vertical). Post-MI women exhibit less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS is associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women is striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women (but not in men). Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</description>

      <title>Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization -- their variance systematically decays as a power law, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, suggesting we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world. This work reveals a new fundamental principle of neural coding in human visual cortex and highlights the importance of examining neural representations across their full dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</description>
