      <title>Geometry and Geography of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are made up of many interacting components. Network science provides the tools to analyze and understand these interactions. Community detection is a key technique in network science for uncovering the structures that shape the behavior of these networks. This thesis introduces the Adaptive Cut, a novel method that improves clustering methods by employing multi-level cuts in hierarchical dendrograms. Overcoming the limitations of traditional single-level cuts-especially in unbalanced dendrograms-the Adaptive Cut provides a multi-level cut by optimizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo with simulated annealing. In addition, we propose the Balanceness score, an information-theoretic metric that quantifies dendrogram balance and predicts the benefits of multilevel cuts. Evaluations on over 200 real and synthetic networks show significant improvements in partition density and modularity. In the second part, our analysis shows that incorporating network geometry allows redefining administrative boundaries into non-contiguous regions that better reflect social and spatial dynamics. We also discuss the representation of hierarchical data in hyperbolic space through Poincare maps, which can represent tree-like structures in low dimension. In addition, we examine how geography constrains human mobility, an aspect often overlooked in scale-free characterizations of mobility. By incorporating geography via the pair distribution function from condensed matter physics, we separate geographic constraints from mobility choices. Analyzing datasets containing millions of individual movements, we identify a universal power law that spans five orders of magnitude, thereby bridging the divide between distance-based and opportunity-driven models of human mobility.</description>

      <title>Optimising for the long game: methodological challenges in energy system optimisation pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathways that describe the optimal evolution of energy systems across multiple decades are important in energy system research and policy literature, with net-zero and similar climate policies being common drivers behind them. While there are many studies on aspects such as spatial and operational resolution, model features, and model transparency, there has been little attention on the methodological considerations of formulating pathway studies in mathematical optimisation terms, and how these methods have evolved over time. To address this, we conduct a systematic review of optimal pathway literature at or above national level focusing on the following: i) the implications of model foresight choices, ii) end effects and related issues that may bias model outcomes, iii) trade-offs in model resolution, and iv) investment dynamics. We showcase how modellers have dealt with these aspects in a large sample of studies spanning multiple decades, and provide recommendations to both modellers and model users on identifying issues that can bias model results and how to improve upon them. In particular, we identify opportunities to better balance long-term anticipatory planning with high operational and spatial detail in models, and to improve the communication and systematic treatment of those mathematical design choices that potentially distort model decisions across time.</description>

      <title>Understanding Main Path Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main path analysis has long been used to trace knowledge trajectories in citation networks, yet it lacks solid theoretical foundations. To understand when and why this approach succeeds, we analyse directed acyclic graphs created from two types of artificial models and by looking at over twenty networks derived from real data.
  We show that entropy-based variants of main path analysis optimise geometric distance measures, providing its first information-theoretic and geometric basis. Numerical results demonstrate that existing algorithms converge on near-geodesic solutions. We also show that an approach based on longest paths produces similar results, is equally well motivated yet is much simpler to implement.
  However, the traditional single-path focus is unnecessarily restrictive, as many near-optimal paths highlight different key nodes. We introduce an approach using ``baskets'' of nodes where we select a fraction of nodes with the smallest values of a measure we call ``generalised criticality''. Analysis of large vaccine citation networks shows that these baskets achieve comprehensive algorithmic coverage, offering a robust, simple, and computationally efficient way to identify core knowledge structures. In practice, we find that those nodes with zero unit criticality capture the information in main paths in almost all cases and capture a wider range of key nodes without unnecessarily increasing the number of nodes considered. We find no advantage in using the traditional main path methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GHSL Population Grids Using Hexagon KH-9 Built-up Data: Refining 1970s Rural and Peri-Urban Distributions in Istanbul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of historical population distributions from the 1970s to the 1990s remains a significant limitation in global gridded population products due to coarse built-up data and limited census records. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to integrate declassified Hexagon KH-9 reconnaissance imagery into gridded population mapping. We enhance the GHS-POP framework by combining segmented built-up land cover from the HexaLCSeg dataset, derived from 1977 KH-9 imagery, with geocoded settlement-level census data to construct high-resolution historical population grids. Applied to Arnavutkoy and Cekmekoy in Istanbul for the period 1975-1990, we evaluate three dasymetric approaches, including a standard GHSL baseline, a Hexagon-enhanced workflow, and a fully integrated model incorporating local census records. Pixel-wise and zonal analyses show that GHSL misallocates populations to historically undeveloped regions, while the Hexagon-derived dataset substantially improves the representation of fragmented rural and peri-urban areas often missing from global products. Incorporating settlement-level LAU-2 census data further refines spatial population distribution. The results demonstrate that combining historical reconnaissance imagery with high-resolution census data improves the accuracy of historical population grids, and given the global coverage of declassified missions, this methodology offers significant potential for reconstructing historical population patterns in data-scarce regions worldwide.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Assessing Sustainability Conflicts in the Design of Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical devices improve healthcare outcomes but often involve sustainability conflicts across environmental, economic, and social pillars. Existing approaches typically prioritize one or two pillars and lack a unified framework to assess cross-domain conflicts. This paper presents a structured framework to identify and quantify sustainability conflicts in medical device design. It integrates life cycle analysis, cause-effect mapping, and multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate the impact of design choices across all three pillars. A case study of an oxygen concentrator illustrates the framework's application and generates a composite sustainability score based on identified trade-offs. The framework supports informed and data-driven design decisions while meeting regulatory and ethical requirements. This work addresses a key gap in sustainable medical device development by offering a repeatable and quantifiable approach to conflict assessment and resolution.</description>

      <title>An AI-Based Framework for Assessing Sustainability Conflicts in Medical Device Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing sustainable medical devices requires balancing environmental, economic, and social demands, yet trade-offs across these pillars are difficult to identify using manual assessment alone. Current methods depend heavily on expert judgment, lack standardisation, and struggle to integrate diverse lifecycle data, which leads to overlooked conflicts and inconsistent evaluations. This paper introduces an AI-driven framework that automates conflict detection. Machine learning and natural language processing are used to extract trade-offs from design decisions, while Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) quantifies their magnitude through a composite sustainability score. The approach improves consistency, reduces subjective bias, and supports early design decisions. The results demonstrate how AI-assisted analysis provides scalable, data-driven support for sustainability evaluation in medical device development.</description>

      <title>Determining social mechanisms for sequential decision-making in a virtual pedestrian route choice experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving groups are routinely faced with a choice of different routes as part of their daily lives, such as choosing between exits from a building. Differences in moving speeds and environmental constraints often lead to individuals being able to observe the choices of others ahead. This social information can inform their decision-making, but exactly how this is being used remains an open question. Previous theoretical studies on animal groups have demonstrated that simple heuristics are plausible and accurate mechanisms, with some further predicting that more recent decisions are more heavily weighted. Experiments with fish corroborate the importance of more recent decisions; however, experimental work is limited. Here, we conduct an online survey with human participants to identify which social decision-making mechanism individuals follow. Contrary to previous experimental work, we find little indication that recent decisions are weighted more heavily; instead, our results suggest that following the majority of previous decisions is the dominant behaviour. Furthermore, self-reported decision-making mechanisms correlate with our experimental findings despite their variability, suggesting that on average individuals can recognize their behavioural tendencies. Our findings give insight into social sequential decision-making, and provide an empirical foundation for integrating realistic social decision mechanisms into pedestrian movement models.</description>

      <title>Climate change impacts on net load under technological uncertainty in European power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Renewable energy sources play a major role in future net-zero energy systems. However, achieving energy system resilience remains challenging, since renewables depend on weather fluctuations, and future energy systems are subject to major design uncertainty. Existing literature mostly treats these types of uncertainty separately. Therefore, the assessment of uncertainties surrounding climate change and energy system design, and particularly their interactions, is insufficiently understood. To close this gap, we evaluate net load to assess energy system stress without relying on perfect foresight, while maintaining temporal and spatial correlations of the climate system. Net load is calculated from hourly historical and future climate model data translated to energy variables. To scope the extent of plausible energy systems, we consider eight different design scenarios inspired by the European Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) and different levels of transmission expansion. We find that climate change impacts on net load are highly sensitive to the energy system design, implying that energy systems can be designed so that they are either hindered or helped by climate change. Furthermore, within a system scenario, climate change can change the frequency and seasonality of high net load events and their technological and meteorological composition. Wind-dominated systems with currently electrified heating levels, for instance, feature a 30% increase of high net load events under climate change, mostly in summer and fall, while fully electrified net zero systems are impacted by high net load events in winter and spring, which decrease by 50% with climate change. Our work thus calls for a wider perspective on energy-climate stress that captures the non-linear interactions of climate change and system design uncertainty, thereby overcoming the current focus on cold Dunkelflauten.</description>

      <title>The Ideological Turing Test for Moderation of Outgroup Affective Animosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rising animosity toward ideological opponents poses critical societal challenges. We introduce and test the Ideological Turing Test, a gamified framework requiring participants to adopt and defend opposing viewpoints, to reduce affective animosity and affective polarization.
  We conducted a mixed-design experiment ($N = 203$) with four conditions: modality (debate/writing) x perspective-taking (Own/Opposite side). Participants engaged in structured interactions defending assigned positions, with outcomes judged by peers. We measured changes in affective animosity and ideological position immediately post-intervention and at 2-6 week follow-up.
  Perspective-taking reduced out-group animosity and ideological polarization. However, effects differed by modality (writing vs. debate) and over time. For affective animosity, writing from the opposite perspective yielded the largest immediate reduction ($\Delta=+0.45$ SD), but the effect was not detectable at the 4-6 week follow-up. In contrast, the debate modality maintained a statistically significant reduction in animosity immediately after and at follow-up ($\Delta=+0.37$ SD). For ideological position, adopting the opposite perspective led to significant immediate movement across modalities (writing: $\Delta=+0.91$ SD; debate: $\Delta=+0.51$ SD), and these changes persisted at follow-up. Judged performance (winning) did not moderate these effects, and willingness to re-participate was similar across conditions (~20-36%).
  These findings challenge assumptions about adversarial methods, revealing distinct temporal patterns: non-adversarial engagement fosters short-term empathy gains, while cognitive engagement through debate sustains affective benefits. The Ideological Turing Test demonstrates potential as a scalable tool for reducing polarization, particularly when combining perspective-taking with reflective adversarial interactions.</description>

      <title>Bibliometric benchmarking across astronomy journals: Knowledge-use cycle and PASJ in the global landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative bibliometric analysis of eight astronomy journals over 1996--2024, including \textit{Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan} (PASJ). Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we extract annual indicators of publication activity and scholarly impact, analyze time series, citation distributions, and citation age profiles, and benchmark PASJ within this landscape. The age profiles reveal a characteristic knowledge-use cycle: citations rise over $\sim$2--4 years, approach saturation by $\sim$10--12 years, underscoring limits of short-window impact metrics. Journals published by European and North American astronomical organizations sustain higher impact, whereas PASJ generally lies below the world baseline. In parallel, PASJ shows episodic above-baseline impact through facility- or mission-driven special issues and features that, given the journal's modest annual volume, can materially shift year-level metrics. These patterns point to two potential avenues for PASJ: well-timed, thoughtfully organized special issues and features that highlight high-impact results, and continued strengthening of international collaboration.</description>

      <title>The Morphemic Origin of Zipf's Law: A Factorized Combinatorial Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple structure based model of how words are formed from morphemes. The model explains two major empirical facts: the typical distribution of word lengths and the appearance of Zipf like rank frequency curves. In contrast to classical explanations based on random text or communication efficiency, our approach uses only the combinatorial organization of prefixes, roots, suffixes and inflections. In this Morphemic Combinatorial Word Model, a word is created by activating several positional slots. Each slot turns on with a certain probability and selects one morpheme from its inventory. Morphemes are treated as stable building blocks that regularly appear in word formation and have characteristic positions. This mechanism produces realistic word length patterns with a concentrated middle zone and a thin long tail, closely matching real languages. Simulations with synthetic morpheme inventories also generate rank frequency curves with Zipf like exponents around 1.1-1.4, similar to English, Russian and Romance languages. The key result is that Zipf like behavior can emerge without meaning, communication pressure or optimization principles. The internal structure of morphology alone, combined with probabilistic activation of slots, is sufficient to create the robust statistical patterns observed across languages.</description>

      <title>Intracavity-birefringence-enabled soliton states and wavelength control in the (C + L)-band fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact all-fiber nonlinear-polarization-evolution (NPE) fiber laser capable of outputting wavelength-manipulated multiple laser states in the C + L band. Leveraging the intracavity birefringence-induced filtering effect, without external spectral filters, the laser achieves wavelength-tunable conventional solitons (CSs) and soliton molecules (SMs) with a tuning range of 72.85 nm and 45.54 nm, respectively, by adjusting the polarization states and pump power. Furthermore, wavelength-switchable harmonic mode-locking (over 1 GHz) and dual-wavelength mode-locking can also be achieved in the C + L band. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental realization of wavelength-manipulated multiple soliton states covering the C + L band in a single-fiber-laser oscillator. Two examples of digital multi-letter encoding and transmission are further demonstrated on this platform by means of pump-driven wavelength/soliton states switching. By enabling controllable multi-state solitons and broad spectral tunability within a compact architecture, our work provides a promising source for spectrally diverse and temporally stable pulsed light sources that hold significant promise for applications in microscopy, bioimaging, and LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Citizen CATE 2024: Extending Totality During the 8 April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse with a Distributed Network of Community Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants ("citizen scientists") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.</description>

      <title>From Nodes to Edges: Edge-Based Laplacians for Brain Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional graph signal processing (GSP) methods applied to brain networks focus on signals defined on the nodes. Thus, they are unable to capture potentially important dynamics occurring on the edges. In this work, we adopt an edge-centric GSP approach to analyze edge signals constructed from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. Specifically, we describe structural connectivity through the lens of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian, processing signals defined on edges to capture co-fluctuation information between brain regions. We demonstrate that edge-based approaches achieve superior task decoding accuracy in static and dynamic scenarios compared to conventional node-based techniques, thereby unveiling unique aspects of brain functional organization. These findings underscore the promise of edge-focused GSP strategies for deepening our understanding of brain connectivity and functional dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called \emph{Fundamental Diagram of Traffic} (FDT), which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>DynamiX: Large-Scale Dynamic Social Network Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders cultivation.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>

      <title>Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of transformative impact on science, yet current systems remain fundamentally limited in enabling genuine scientific discovery. This perspective contends that progress turns on closing three mutually reinforcing gaps in abstraction, reasoning and empirical grounding. Central to addressing these gaps is recognizing complementary cognitive modes: thinking as slow, iterative hypothesis generation -- exploring counterfactual spaces where physical laws can be temporarily violated to discover new patterns -- and reasoning as fast, deterministic validation, traversing established knowledge graphs to test consistency with known principles. Abstractions in this loop should be manipulable models that enable counterfactual prediction, causal attribution, and refinement. Design principles -- rather than a monolithic recipe -- are proposed for systems that reason in imaginary spaces and learn from the world: causal, multimodal models for internal simulation; persistent, uncertainty-aware scientific memory that distinguishes hypotheses from established claims; formal verification pathways coupled to computations and experiments. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties make human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent architectural component. Evaluations must assess the system's ability to identify novel phenomena, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and efficiently guide experimental programs toward genuine discoveries.</description>

      <title>Journal Publications in Medicine: Ranking vs. Interdisciplinarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR.</description>

      <title>Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from international club football in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts seem to be close to a coin toss in top European club football.</description>
