      <title>The influence of cell phenotype on collective cell invasion into the extracellular matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) during collective cell invasion is crucial for advancements in tissue engineering, cancer therapies, and regenerative medicine. This study focuses on the roles of contact guidance and ECM remodelling in directing cell behaviour, with a particular emphasis on exploring how differences in cell phenotype impact collective cell invasion. We present a computationally tractable two-dimensional hybrid model of collective cell migration within the ECM, where cells are modelled as individual entities and collagen fibres as a continuous tensorial field. Our model incorporates random motility, contact guidance, cell-cell adhesion, volume filling, and the dynamic remodelling of collagen fibres through cellular secretion and degradation. Through a comprehensive parameter sweep, we provide valuable insights into how differences in the cell phenotype, in terms of the ability of the cell to migrate, secrete, degrade, and respond to contact guidance cues from the ECM, impacts the characteristics of collective cell invasion.</description>

      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For extensile active stresses, beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension first comes into alignment, then buckles via a classical bend instability. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested into a steady, flowing state by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber appear at yet larger extensile activity, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, the particles can surf along the bent environment of their own creation. More exotic states are also observed, including a oscillatory 'thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the first arrested state.</description>
