      <title>The SHERLOCK pipeline: new exoplanet candidates in the WASP-16, HAT-P-27, HAT-P-26, and TOI-2411 systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launches of NASA Kepler and TESS missions have significantly enhanced the interest in the exoplanet field during the last 15 years, providing a vast amount of public data that is being exploited by the community thanks to the continuous development of new analysis tools. However, using these tools is not straightforward, and users must dive into different codes, input-output formats, and methodologies, hindering an efficient and robust exploration of the available data. We present the SHERLOCK pipeline, an end-to-end public software that allows the users to easily explore observations from space-based missions such as TESS or Kepler to recover known planets and candidates issued by the official pipelines and search for new planetary candidates that remained unnoticed. The pipeline incorporates all the steps to search for transit-like features, vet potential candidates, provide statistical validation, conduct a Bayesian fitting, and compute observational windows from ground-based observatories. Its performance is tested against a catalog of known and confirmed planets from the TESS mission, trying to recover the official TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), explore the existence of companions that have been missed, and release them as new planetary candidates. SHERLOCK demonstrated an excellent performance, recovering 98% of the TOIs and confirmed planets in our test sample and finding new candidates. Specifically, we release four new planetary candidates around the systems WASP-16 (with P$\sim$10.46 d and R$\sim$2.20 $R_\oplus$), HAT-P-27 (with P$\sim$1.20 d and R$\sim$4.33 $R_\oplus$), HAT-P-26 (with P$\sim$6.59 d and R$\sim$1.97 $R_\oplus$), and TOI-2411 (with P$\sim$18.75 d and R$\sim$2.88 $R_\oplus$).</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of isotopes and compositional mixing in the inner protoplanetary disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass-independent isotopic signatures of planetary bodies have been widely used to trace the mixing and transport processes in planet formation. The observed isotopic variations among meteorites have been further linked to the modeled mass-weighted mean initial semimajor axes, assuming a spatial isotopic gradient in the inner protoplanetary disk. However, nucleosynthetic isotopic anomalies of nonvolatile elements and mass-independent oxygen isotopic variation ($\Delta ^{17}$O) show different relationships with distance from the Sun. Therefore, it is crucial to know whether isotopes were distributed systematically with heliocentric distance. In this study, we performed N-body simulations on compositional mixing during the collisional accretion and migration of planetary bodies to investigate the spatial distributions of Cr and O isotopes in the inner protoplanetary disk. The modeled mass-weighted mean initial semimajor axes of the parent bodies of noncarbonaceous (NC) meteorites and terrestrial planets were used to calculate the isotopic compositions of these bodies. Our simulations successfully reproduced the observed nucleosynthetic Cr isotopic anomaly among Earth, Mars, and the NC meteorite parent bodies, consistent with a spatial gradient of isotopic anomalies in the inner disk. Asteroids originating from different regions in the inner disk were transported to the main belt in our simulations, resulting in the Cr isotopic anomaly variation of the NC meteorite parent bodies. However, the $\Delta ^{17}$O distribution among the terrestrial planets and the NC meteorite parent bodies could not be reproduced assuming a $\Delta ^{17}$O gradient. The absence of a $\Delta ^{17}$O gradient reflects that the oxygen isotopic mass-independent fractionation might have altered the spatial distribution of the nucleosynthetic $\Delta ^{17}$O variation before protoplanets formed.</description>

      <title>Accretion regions of meteorite parent bodies inferred from a two-endmember isotopic mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diverse isotopic anomalies of meteorites demonstrate that the protoplanetary disk was composed of components from different stellar sources, which mixed in the disk and formed the planetary bodies. However, the origin of the accretion materials of different planetary bodies and the cosmochemical relationship between these bodies remain ambiguous. The noncarbonaceous (NC) planetary bodies originate from the inner solar system and have isotopic compositions distinct from those of the carbonaceous (CC) bodies. We combined Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Mo, and Ru isotopic anomalies to develop a quantitative two-endmember mixing model of the NC bodies. Correlations of the isotopic anomalies of different elements with different cosmochemical behaviors originate from the mixing of two common endmembers. Using this mixing model, we calculated the isotopic anomalies of NC bodies for all the considered isotopes, including the isotopic anomalies that are difficult to measure or have been altered by spallation processes. The mixing proportion between the two endmembers in each NC body has been calculated as a cosmochemical parameter, which represents the compositional relationship of the accretion materials between the NC bodies. Using the calculated mixing proportions, the feeding zones of the NC bodies could be estimated. The estimated feeding zones of NC bodies indicate a large population of interlopers in the main asteroid belt and an indigenous origin of Vesta. The feeding zones estimated in different planet formation scenarios indicate that the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn during formation of terrestrial planets were likely to be more circular than their current ones.</description>

      <title>Metal-silicate mixing in planetesimal collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impacts between differentiated planetesimals are ubiquitous in protoplanetary discs and may mix materials from the core, mantle, and crust of planetesimals, thus forming stony-iron meteorites. The surface composition of the asteroid (16) Psyche represents a mixture of metal and non-metal components. However, the velocities, angles, and outcome regimes of impacts that mixed metal and silicate from different layers of planetesimals are debated. Our aim is to investigate the impacts between planetesimals that can mix large amounts of metal and silicate, and the mechanism of stony-iron meteorite formation. We used smooth particle hydrodynamics to simulate the impacts between differentiated planetesimals with various initial conditions that span different outcome regimes. In our simulations, the material strength was included and the effects of the states of planetesimal cores were studied. Using a statistical approach, we quantitatively analysed the distributions of metal and silicate after impacts. Our simulations modelled the mass, depth, and sources of the metal-silicate mixture in different impact conditions. Our results suggest that the molten cores in planetesimals could facilitate mixing of metal and silicate. Large amounts of the metal-silicate mixture could be produced by low-energy accretional impacts and high-energy erosive impacts in the largest impact remnant, and by hit-and-run and erosive impacts in the second-largest impact remnant. After impact, most of the metal-silicate mixture was buried at depth, consistent with the low cooling rates of stony-iron meteorites. Our results indicate that mesosiderites potentially formed in an erosive impact, while pallasites potentially formed in an accretional or hit-and-run impact. The mixing of metal and non-metal components on Psyche may also be the result of impacts.</description>

      <title>First Comparative Exoplanetology Within a Transiting Multi-planet System: Comparing the atmospheres of V1298 Tau b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The V1298 Tau system (20-30Myr), is a benchmark young multi-planet system that provides the opportunity to perform comparative exoplanetology between planets orbiting the same star right after their formation.
  We present the first atmospheric comparison between two planets in the same transiting system: V1298 Tau b and V1298 Tau c. We derive constraints on the mass of planet b and c (&lt;20M$_\oplus$ at 3$\sigma$ confidence level and $17_{-6}^{+13} M_{\oplus}$ respectively) and atmospheric metallicity (logZ/Z$_\odot$=-2.04$_{-0.59}^{0.69}$, -0.16$_{-0.94}^{1.15}$ respectively) from atmospheric retrievals. The V1298 Tau planets, are likely to be similar in terms of mass at the current age, implying that both planets are potential sub-Neptune/super-Earth progenitors. However, planet c is expected to lose a higher fraction of its mass compared to planet b given its close proximity to the host star. Alternatively, the observed spectrum of planet c can be explained by atmospheric hazes, which is in contrast to planet b where efficient haze formation can be ruled out. Higher haze formation efficiency in planet c could be due to differences in atmospheric composition, temperature and higher UV flux incident compared to planet b.</description>

      <title>Crystalline forsterite to 160 GPa: the striking metastability of one of Universe's most abundant minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among Universe's most consequential events are large impacts generating rapidly-evolving extreme pressures and temperatures. Crystalline and amorphous forms of (Mg, Fe)2SiO4 are abundant and widespread, within planets and in space. The behavior of these minerals is expected to deviate form thermodynamic equilibrium in many of the processes that are critical to the formation and evolution of planets, particularly shock events. To further the understanding of the behavior of the silicate under extreme conditions, we statically compressed a crystal of forsterite up to 160.5 GPa, far beyond the compound's stability field, and probed its long-range ordering with synchrotron microdiffraction. We found that forsterite retains long-range ordering up to the highest pressure reached. Forsterite III, emerging at about 58 GPa, persists in compression to 160.5 GPa and in decompression down to about 13 GPa, for a rare combined occurrence of a metastable phase of nearly 150 GPa. These observations dispute earlier reports of pressure-induced amorphization and are a unique testimony of the resilience of the crystalline state in quasi hydrostatic compression. We confirm that highly disordered forsterite can be obtained from the decompression of forsterite III as suggested from the substantial loss of long-range ordering observed at 7 GPa after further decompression. Such kinetic pathway may explain how synthetic olivine glass have been obtained in shock experiments and could be a mechanism of generation of amorphous forsterite in cosmic dust. The 120 GPa Hugoniot discontinuity finds no correspondence in our data, marking a departure from the parallelism between static "cold compression" and dynamic compression.</description>

      <title>Inner dusty regions of protoplanetary discs -- III. The role of non-radial radiation pressure in dust dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore dynamical behaviour of dust particles that populate the surface of inner optically thick protoplanetary discs. This is a disc region with the hottest dust and of a great importance for planet formation and dust evolution, but we still struggle to understand all the forces that shape this environment. In our approach we combine results from two separate numerical studies - one is the wind velocity and density distributions obtained from magnetohydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs, and the other is a high-resolution multigrain dust radiation transfer. In our previous paper in the series, we described the methodology for utilising these results as an environmental input for the integration of dust trajectories driven by gravity, gas drag, and radiation pressure. Now we have two improvements - we incorporate time changes in the wind density and velocity, and we implement the non-radial radiation pressure force. We applied our analysis on Herbig Ae and T Tau stars. We confirm that the radiation pressure force can lead to dust outflow, especially in the case of more luminous stars. Additionally, it opposes dust accretion at the inner disc edge and reduces dust settling. These effects are enhanced by the disc wind, especially in the zone where the stellar and the disc magnetic fields meet. Our results suggest that dust grains can stay in the hottest disc region for an extended period and then can end up ejected into the outer disc regions.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of bright deposits in permanently shadowed craters on Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bright deposits in permanently shadowed craters on Ceres are thought to harbor water ice. However, the evidence for water ice presented thus far is indirect. We aim to directly detect the spectral characteristics of water ice in bright deposits present in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) in polar craters on Ceres. We analyzed narrowband images of four of the largest shadowed bright deposits acquired by the Dawn Framing Camera to reconstruct their reflectance spectra, carefully considering issues such as in-field stray light correction and image compression artifacts. The sunlit portion of a polar deposit known to harbor water ice has a negative (blue) spectral slope of $-58 \pm 12$ % $\mu$m$^{-1}$ relative to the background in the visible wavelength range. We find that the PSR bright deposits have similarly blue spectral slopes, consistent with a water ice composition. Based on the brightness and spectral properties, we argue that the ice is likely present as particles of high purity. Other components such as phyllosilicates may be mixed in with the ice. Salts are an unlikely brightening agent given their association with cryovolcanic processes, of which we find no trace. Our spectral analysis strengthens the case for the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters on Ceres.</description>

      <title>Super-Earth formation with slow migration from a ring in an evolving peaked disk compatible with terrestrial planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the origin of the radially concentrated solar system's terrestrial planets, planet formation from a ring of solids at about 1 au from the Sun with convergent/suppressed type I migration is preferred. On the other hand, many super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are found in the close-in region with orbital periods of 10-100 days, so that planet formation from rings in the 1-au region would require some degree of inward migration. One way to realize these different formation scenarios is to use different gas disk models. In this study we investigate whether different scenarios can be realized within a single framework. We consider a disk model that evolves via disk winds and develops a density peak, and study planet formation and orbital evolution using N-body simulations. Planets with masses less than an Earth mass formed from a low-mass ring resembling the solar system do not migrate inward even in the evolving disk and remain near 1-au orbits, maintaining a high radial mass concentration. On the other hand, planets with masses greater than an Earth mass formed from a massive ring slowly migrate inward above the outward migration region. As a result, the innermost planet can move to an orbit of about 10 days. The simulation results also reproduce the characteristics (e.g., mass distribution, eccentricity, orbital separation) of the solar system and super-Earth/sub-Neptune systems. Our model predicts that Earths and sub-Earths formed by migration from rings at near the 1-au region are less abundant in the close-in region.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of binary asteroid systems post rotational failure: a recipe for making atypically shaped satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary asteroid formation is a highly complex process, which has been highlighted with recent observations of satellites with unexpected shapes, such as the oblate Dimorphos by the NASA DART mission and the contact binary Selam by NASA's Lucy mission. There is no clear consensus on which dynamical mechanisms determine the final shape of these objects. In turn, we explore a formation pathway where spin-up and rotational failure of a rubble pile asteroid lead to mass-shedding and a wide circumasteroidal debris disk in which the satellite forms. Using a combination of smooth-particle hydrodynamical and N-body simulations, we study the dynamical evolution in detail. We find that a debris disk containing matter corresponding to a few percent of the primary asteroid mass extending beyond the fluid Roche limit can consistently form both oblate and bilobate satellites via a series of tidal encounters with the primary body and mergers with other gravitational aggregates. Principally, satellites end up prolate (elongated) and on synchronous orbits, accreting mainly in a radial direction while tides from the primary asteroid keep the shape intact. However, close encounters and mergers can break the orbital state, leading to orbital migration and deformation. Satellite-satellite impacts occurring in this regime have lower impact velocities than merger-driven moon formation in e.g. planetary rings, leading to soft impacts between differently sized, non-spherical bodies. The resulting post-merger shape of the satellite is highly dependent on the impact geometry. Only moons having experienced a prior mild or catastrophic tidal disruption during a close encounter with the primary asteroid can become oblate spheroids, which is consistent with the predominantly prolate observed population of binary asteroid satellites.</description>

      <title>Flows, Circulations, and Energy Transport in the Outer and Deep Atmospheres of Synchronous and Non-synchronous Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vertical enthalpy transport can explain the inflated radii of highly irradiated gaseous exoplanets. They have also shown that rotation can influence this transport, leading to highly irradiated, rapidly rotating, objects that are uninflated. Here we explore the underlying flows, including the impact of (non)synchronous rotation. We use DYNAMICO to run a series of long-timescale, HD209-like, atmospheric models at various surface rotation rates. For models that are tidally-locked, we consider rotation rates between $1/16^\mathrm{th}$ and $40$ times the rotation rate of HD209, whilst for non-synchronous models we consider the range $1/8^\mathrm{th}$ to $4$x. We find that our synchronous models fall into one of three $\Omega$-dependent regimes: at low $\Omega$, we find that the outer atmosphere dynamics are driven by a divergent day-night wind, driving weak vertical transport and the formation of a night-side hot-spot. At intermediate $\Omega$, we find classical hot Jupiter dynamics, whilst at high $\Omega$ we find a strong Coriolis effect that suppresses off-equator dynamics, including the jet-driving standing waves, thus also reducing vertical transport. As for non-synchronicity, when small, we find that it has little effect on dynamics. However as it grows, we find that temporal variations prevents the formation of the persistent structures that drive global dynamics. We find that rotation can significantly impact the atmospheric dynamics of irradiated exoplanets, including vertical advection, which may explain the scatter in the radius-irradiation relation. We have also identified a seemingly robust feature at slow rotation: a night-side hot-spot. As this may have important implications for both the phase curve and atmospheric chemistry, we suggest that this study be followed up with next-generation GCMs that robustly model radiation/chemistry.</description>

      <title>Statistics and Habitability of F-type Star--Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F-type star--planet systems represent an intriguing case for habitability studies. Although F-type stars spend considerably less time on the main-sequence than G, K, and M-type stars, they still offer a unique set of features, allowing for the principal possibility of exolife. Examples of the latter include the increased widths of stellar habitable zones as well as the presence of enhanced UV flux, which in moderation may have added to the origin of life in the Universe. In this study, we pursue a detailed statistical analysis of the currently known planet-hosting F-type stars by making use of the NASA Exoplanet Archive. After disregarding systems with little or no information on the planet(s), we identify 206 systems of interest. We also evaluate whether the stars are on the main-sequence based on various criteria. In one approach, we use the stellar evolution code MESA. Depending on the adopted criterion, about 60 to 80 stars have been identified as main-sequence stars. In 18 systems, the planet spends at least part of its orbit within the stellar habitable zone. In one case, i.e., HD 111998, commonly known as 38 Vir, the planet is situated in the habitable zone at all times. Our work may serve as a basis for future studies, including studies on the existence of Earth-mass planets in F-type systems, as well as investigations of possibly habitable exomoons hosted by exo-Jupiters as the lowest-mass habitable zone planet currently identified has a mass estimate of 143 Earth masses.</description>

      <title>Spinel-Bearing Spherules Condensed from the Chicxulub Impact-Vapor Plume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Formation of the giant Chicxulub crater off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula coincided with deposition of the global Ir-rich Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) stratigraphic boundary layer at ca. 65 Ma. The boundary is marked most sharply by abundant spherules containing unaltered grains of magnesioferrite spinel. Here we predict for the first time the sequential condensation of solids and liquids from the plume of vaporized rock expected from oblique K-T impacts. We predict highly oxidizing plumes that condense silicate liquid droplets bearing spinel grains whose compositions closely match those marking the actual boundary. Systematic global variations in spinel composition are consistent with higher condensation temperatures for spinels found at Atlantic and European sites than for those in the Pacific.</description>

      <title>nuance: Efficient detection of planets transiting active stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of planetary transits in the light curves of active stars, featuring correlated noise in the form of stellar variability, remains a challenge. Depending on the noise characteristics, we show that the traditional technique that consists of detrending a light curve before searching for transits alters their signal-to-noise ratio, and hinders our capability to discover exoplanets transiting rapidly-rotating active stars. We present nuance, an algorithm to search for transits in light curves while simultaneously accounting for the presence of correlated noise, such as stellar variability and instrumental signals. We assess the performance of nuance on simulated light curves as well as on the TESS light curves of 438 rapidly-rotating M dwarfs. For each dataset, we compare our method to 5 commonly-used detrending techniques followed by a search with the Box-Least-Square algorithm. Overall, we demonstrate that nuance is the most performant method in 93% of cases, leading to both the highest number of true positives and the lowest number of false positive detections. Although simultaneously searching for transits while modeling correlated noise is expected to be computationally expensive, we make our algorithm tractable and available as the JAX-powered Python package nuance, allowing its use on distributed environments and GPU devices. Finally, we explore the prospects offered by the nuance formalism, and its use to advance our knowledge of planetary systems around active stars, both using space-based surveys and sparse ground-based observations.</description>

      <title>The MOPYS project: A survey of 70 planets in search of extended He I and H atmospheres. No evidence of enhanced evaporation in young planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the first Gyr of their life, exoplanet atmospheres suffer from different atmospheric escape phenomena that can strongly affect the shape and morphology of the exoplanet itself. These processes can be studied with Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$ and/or He I triplet observations. We present high-resolution spectroscopy observations from CARMENES and GIARPS checking for He I and H$\alpha$ signals in 20 exoplanetary atmospheres: V1298Tau c, K2-100b, HD63433b, HD63433c, HD73583b, HD73583c, K2-77b, TOI-2076b, TOI-2048b, HD235088b, TOI-1807b, TOI-1136d, TOI-1268b, TOI-1683b, TOI-2018b, MASCARA-2b, WASP-189b, TOI-2046b, TOI-1431b, and HAT-P-57b. We report two new high-resolution spectroscopy He I detections for TOI-1268b and TOI-2018b, and an H$\alpha$ detection for TOI-1136d. The MOPYS (Measuring Out-flows in Planets orbiting Young Stars) project aims to understand the evaporating phenomena and test their predictions from the current observations. We compiled a list of 70 exoplanets with He I and/or H$\alpha$ observations, from this work and the literature, and we considered the He I and H$\alpha$ results as proxy for atmospheric escape. Our principal results are that 0.1-1Gyr-old planets do not exhibit more He I or H$\alpha$ detections than older planets, and evaporation signals are more frequent for planets orbiting $\sim$1-3Gyr-old stars. We provide new constrains to the cosmic shoreline, the empirical division between rocky planets and planets with atmosphere, by using the evaporation detections and explore the capabilities of a new dimensionless parameter, $R_{\rm He}/R_{\rm Hill}$, to explain the He I triplet detections. Furthermore, we present a statistically significant upper boundary for the He I triplet detections in the $T_{\rm eq}$ vs $\rho_{\rm p}$ parameter space. Planets located above that boundary are unlikely to show He I absorption signals.</description>

      <title>The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS): Asteroid Population Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solar System Notification Alert Processing System (SNAPS) is a ZTF and Rubin Observatory alert broker that will send alerts to the community regarding interesting events in the Solar System. SNAPS is actively monitoring Solar System objects and one of its functions is to compare objects (primarily main belt asteroids) to one another to find those that are outliers relative to the population. In this paper, we use the SNAPShot1 dataset which contains 31,693 objects from ZTF and derive outlier scores for each of these objects. SNAPS employs an unsupervised approach; consequently, to derive outlier rankings for each object, we propose four different outlier metrics such that we can explore variants of outlier scores and add confidence to outlier rankings. We also provide outlier scores for each object in each permutation of 15 feature spaces, between 2 and 15 features, which yields 32,752 total feature spaces. We show that we can derive population outlier rankings each month at Rubin Observatory scale using four Nvidia A100 GPUs, and present several avenues of scientific investigation that can be explored using population outlier detection.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray flux limits from brown dwarfs: Implications for dark matter annihilating into long-lived mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs (BDs) are celestial objects representing the link between the least massive main-sequence stars and giant gas planets. In the first part of this article, we perform a model-independent search of a gamma-ray signal from the direction of nine nearby BDs in 13 years of \Fermi-LAT data. We find no significant excess of gamma rays, and we, therefore, set 95\% confidence level upper limits on the gamma-ray flux with a binned-likelihood approach. In the second part of the paper, we interpret these bounds within an exotic mechanism proposed for gamma-ray production in BDs: If the dark matter (DM) of the universe is constituted of particles with non-negligible couplings to the standard model, BDs may efficiently accumulate them through scatterings. DM particles eventually thermalise, and can annihilate into light, long-lived, mediators which later decay into photons outside the BD. Within this framework, the current Fermi-LAT stacked upper limits on the gamma-ray flux of the selected BDs do not enable setting a bound on the DM-nucleon cross-section. An improvement of approximately a factor of 9 in the gamma-ray limits is required to obtain bounds on the scattering cross-section $\sigma_{\chi n}$ $\sim 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ for DM masses below 10 GeV. This improvement would cover a larger portion of the parameter space in mediator decay length and DM mass. The code and data to reproduce the results of this study are available on GitLab at \github{https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/francesca.calore/brown-dwarfs-gamma}.</description>
