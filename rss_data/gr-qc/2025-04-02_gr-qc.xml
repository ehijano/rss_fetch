      <title>Quasinormal modes of a Proca field in Schwarzschild-AdS$_5$ spacetime via the isomonodromy method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Proca field perturbations in a five-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter (Schwarzschild-AdS$_{5}$) black hole geometry. Using the vector spherical harmonic (VSH) method, we show that the Proca field decomposes into scalar-type and vector-type components according to their tensorial behavior on the three-sphere. Two degrees of freedom of the field are described by scalar-type components, which are coupled due to the mass term, while the remaining two degrees of freedom are described by a vector-type component, which decouples completely. Motivated by the Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'{a}k-Santos (FKKS) ansatz in the limit of zero spin, we use a field transformation to decouple the scalar-type components at the expense of introducing a complex separation parameter $\beta$. This parameter can be determined analytically, and its values correspond to two distinct polarizations of the scalar-type sector: "electromagnetic" and "non-electromagnetic", denoted by $\beta_{+}$ and $\beta_{-}$, respectively. In the scalar-type sector, the radial differential equation for each polarization is a Fuchsian differential equation with five singularities, whereas in the vector-type sector, the radial equation has four singularities. By means of the isomonodromy method, we reformulate the boundary value problem in terms of the initial conditions of the Painlev\'{e} VI $\tau$ function and, using a series expansion of the $\tau$ function, we compute the scalar-type and vector-type quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the small horizon limit. Our results are in overall very good agreement with those obtained via the numerical integration method. This shows that the isomonodromy method is a reliable method to compute quasinormal modes in the small horizon limit with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Information Across the Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of black holes on entanglement harvesting has been of considerable interest over the past decade. Research involving stationary Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors near a (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has uncovered phenomena such as entanglement shadows, entanglement amplification through black hole rotation, and differences between bipartite and tripartite entanglement. For a (1+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, it has been shown that two infalling UDW detectors can harvest entanglement from the scalar quantum vacuum even when separated by an event horizon. In this paper, we calculate the mutual information between two UDW detectors coupled to a massless quantum scalar field, with the detectors starting at rest and falling radially into a non-rotating (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. The trajectory of the detectors includes regions where both detectors are switched on outside of the horizon; where one detector is switched on inside of the horizon while the other switches on outside; and where both detectors switch on inside of the horizon. We investigate different black hole masses, detector energy gaps, widths and temporal separations of the detector switching functions, and field boundary conditions. We find that black holes--even the simplest kind having constant curvature--significantly affect the correlation properties of quantum fields in the vacuum state. These correlations, both outside and inside the horizon, can be mapped out by infalling detectors.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and excitation factors of Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical understanding of the characteristic oscillations of a perturbed black hole, also referred to as quasinormal modes (QNMs), is crucial to interpreting the late stage of binary black hole mergers that we now routinely observe in gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we introduce a new approach, based on the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura formalism, to compute the QNM spectra and their excitation factors (QNEFs), for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Using this approach, QNM wavefunctions remain finite at the horizon and spatial infinity. Our results in general agree with previous calculations that were performed using different methods, though we further clarify that QNEFs and their scaling with the mass of the black hole depend on the spin-weight of the perturbation. We show that avoided crossing is not a general phenomenon: the real or the imaginary part of the eigenvalues can cross each other but not both simultaneously, and when crossing occurs in one part, repulsion follows in the another part. Eigenvalue repulsion, originating from branch point singularities, still plays an important role in the QNM spectra, despite the fact that the spectra depend only on the real-valued black hole angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Curved spacetimes with continuous light disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly curved spacetimes of compact astrophysical objects are known to possess light rings (null circular geodesics) with {\it discrete} radii on which massless particles can perform closed circular motions. In the present compact paper, we reveal for the first time the existence of isotropic curved spacetimes that possess light disks which are made of a {\it continuum} of closed light rings. In particular, using analytical techniques which are based on the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations, we prove that these physically intriguing spacetimes contain a central compact core of radius $r_-&gt;0$ that supports an outer spherical shell with an infinite number (a continuum) of null circular geodesic which are all characterized by the functional relations $4\pi r^2_{\gamma}p(r_{\gamma})=1-3m(r_{\gamma})/r_{\gamma}$ and $8\pi r^2_{\gamma}(\rho+p)=1$ for $r_{\gamma}\in[r_-,r_+]$ [here $\{\rho,p\}$ are respectively the energy density and the isotropic pressure of the self-gravitating matter fields and $m(r)$ is the gravitational mass contained within the sphere of radius $r$].</description>

      <title>Pseudospectrum of rotating analogue black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the stability of quasinormal modes is essential for understanding black hole dynamics, particularly in the context of gravitational wave emissions and black hole spectroscopy. In this study, we employ the hyperboloidal approach to reformulate the quasinormal mode problem of a rotating analogue black hole, effectively transforming it into an eigenvalue problem associated with a non-self-adjoint operator. Using this method, we examine the influence of rotation on the stability of the QNM spectrum, relying on the associated pseudospectrum for qualitative assessment. Our findings indicate that the prograde overtones become more stable as rotation increases. This work enhances our understanding of spectrum stability in rotating systems and expands the study of pseudospectra in non-spherically symmetric spacetimes, with potential for empirical testing in terrestrial laboratories.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectral instabilities in the laboratory: Shallow water analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small deviations in the spacetime around black holes can lead to instabilities in the underlying quasinormal mode spectrum, potentially altering the hierarchy of its overtones. A practical way to induce such spectral instability is by introducing small modifications to the effective potential governing the dynamics of fluctuations in the black hole spacetime. While finding a physically meaningful interpretation for such ad hoc modifications in an astrophysical context can be challenging, analogue black hole models provide an alternative framework to explore their effects and study the instabilities. In this work, we consider an analogue black hole modeled by a draining bathtub flow and demonstrate that vorticities in the fluid introduce a small bump in the effective potential of the wave equation. This naturally realizes a physically motivated version of the elephant and the flea configuration. We analyze the spectrum using two complementary approaches: direct mode computation via two distinct frequency-domain methods and time evolution of initial perturbations. As in astrophysical black holes, the vorticities destabilizes the QNM spectrum of the analogue system, possibly yielding time evolution with long-lived ringing effects, akin to those observed for massive fields in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modification to General Relativity by making a redefinition of the coupling constant in front of the Ricci curvature scalar along with the Generalized Quasi-topological Gravity theories added to the action, that we named Geometric Cosmology. We give four different exponential convergent models for this class of theories belonging to three different gravities of the Geometric Cosmology theories.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of GW170104 and reconstruction of the gravitational-wave polarization modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detections\citep{KAGRA:2023pio,LIGOScientific:2019lzm} and analysis of gravitational waves(GWs) have introduced us in a new era of our understanding of the cosmos, providing new insights into astrophysical systems involving massive objects as black holes and neutron stars. Normally the precise sky localization of a GW source needs data from three or more observatories. However, the results presented in this article demonstrate that it is in fact possible to obtain the position of a GW source in a small region of the celestial sphere using data from just two GW observatories, in this case LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston. Furthermore, we are also able to reconstruct the gravitational-wave polarization\citep{Poisson2014} modes(PMs) for the GW170104\citep{Abbott:2017vtc} event, challenging in this way the conventional belief that accurate reconstruction of PMs and precise sky localization are unattainable with data from only these two detectors. The procedure only uses the spin 2 properties of the GW, so that it does not rely on specific assumptions on the nature of the source. Our findings are possible through careful data filtering methods\citep{Moreschi:2019vxw}, the use of refined signal processing algorithms\citep{Moreschi:2024njx}, and the application of dedicated denoising\citep{Mallat2009} techniques. This progress in the GW studies represents the first instance of a direct measurement of PMs using such a limited observational data. Also, our approach enhances the precision of sky localization for events detected solely by two GW observatories. We provide detailed validation through the reconstruction of PMs for different polarization angles, and calculations of residuals for the GW170104 event. We also test the procedure with synthetic data with ten different source locations and polarization angles.</description>

      <title>A Directive for Obtaining Algebraically General Solutions of Einstein Equations Based on the Canonical Killing Tensor Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work serves as a sequel to our previous study, where, by assuming the existence of canonical Killing tensor forms and applying a general null tetrad transformation, we obtained a variety of solutions (Petrov types D, III, N) in vacuum with cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Among these, there is a unique Petrov type D solution with a shear-free, diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence that admits the $K^2_{\mu \nu}$ canonical form, which we present in full detail. Additionally, we introduce a Petrov type I solution with a shear-free, diverging, and non-geodesic null congruence, obtained by starting from the same canonical form and employing Lorentz transformations within the concept of symmetric null tetrads, instead of a general null tetrad transformation. Building on this and following the concept of symmetric null tetrads, we propose a new directive. This suggests that, by assuming the canonical forms of the Killing tensor and employing Lorentz transformations that correlate the spin coefficients among themselves, such as $\pi=-\bar{\tau}$ and $\kappa = -\bar{\nu}$, one can obtain a broader class of algebraically general solutions to Einstein's equations, rather than relying solely on boosts and spatial rotations.</description>

      <title>Localization of GW190521 and reconstruction of the spin-2 gravitational-wave polarization modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the new developments of the procedure L2D+PMR for sky localization\citep{KAGRA:2013rdx} using data from two gravitational-wave detectors and the reconstruction of gravitational-wave polarization modes\citep{Poisson2014}, which we have previously presented\citep{Moreschi25a}. In this case we apply our methods to the GW190521\citep{Abbott:2020tfl} event, which was recorded by three gravitational-wave observatories. We find the localization of the source close to one of the crossings of two delay rings, as expected. Thus, our results corroborate the consistency of the procedure. We compare our findings with those obtained by the LIGO/Virgo Collaborations, providing an independent assessment of gravitational-wave localization. We present the second direct measurement of spin-2 gravitational-wave polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a black hole in AdS space-time surrounded by quintessence: geodesic, shadow and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel exact solution to the gravitational field equations, known as the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia black hole solution, set against the backdrop of anti-de Sitter space and surrounded by a quintessence field. This solution serves as an interpolation between three distinct anti-de Sitter black hole configurations, namely, the Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia, Schwarzschild-Kiselev, and the standard Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The first aspect of our investigation focuses on the geodesic motion of particles, where we explore how the black hole's space-time geometry-incorporating the effects of nonlinear electrodynamics, the quintessence field, and the curvature radius-influences the dynamics of both massless and massive particles near the black hole. To further enrich our analysis, we extend the study to include the perturbative dynamics of a massless scalar field within the black hole solution, placing special emphasis on the scalar perturbative potential. Subsequently, we focus into the phenomenon of black hole shadows, examining how various parameters, such as the nonlinear electrodynamics, the curvature of space-time and the presence of the quintessence field, impact the size and shape of the shadow cast by the black hole. In the final segment of our study, we shift our attention to the thermodynamics of the black hole solution. We compute several essential thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, specific heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, analyzing how these properties evolve in response to changes in the various parameters that define the space-time geometry, which in turn affect the gravitational field when compared to the traditional black hole</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

      <title>Parameter constraints on a black hole with Minkowski core through quasiperiodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geodesic motion of charged particles in the vicinity of regular black holes with a Minkowski core, embedded in a uniform magnetic field, and study the influences of magnetic field and regular black hole parameter on the radial effective potential and angular momentum of the particles' orbits. We perturb the circular orbit and analyze the characteristic frequencies of the epicyclic oscillations, which are closely related with the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole. Then using the MCMC simulation, we fit our theoretical results with four observational QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, XTE J1859+226, and GRS 1915+105) and provide constraints on the magnetic field strength $B$, the characteristic radius $r$, the mass $M$, and the regular black hole parameter $g$. In particular, since the parameter $g$ describes the degree of deviation from the classical Schwarzschild black hole, our studies suggest that, within a certain level of confidence, the black holes in the current model can deviate from the classical singularity structure of Schwarzschild black holes, and exhibit quantum corrections near the core.</description>

      <title>Origin of bulk viscosity in cosmology and its thermodynamic implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is two folded: (1) we propose a new mechanism for the origin of bulk viscosity in cosmological context, and then, (2) we address the thermodynamic implications of viscous cosmology based on the thermodynamics of apparent horizon. In particular, we show that the velocity gradient of the comoving expansion of the universe (along the distance measured from a comoving observer) in turn leads to a viscous like pressure of the fluid inside the apparent horizon. This points the importance of the bulk viscosity of fluid during the cosmological evolution of the universe, as the comoving expansion itself generates the viscosity. Therefore the thermodynamic interpretations of viscous cosmology becomes important from its own right. In this regard, it turns out that the cosmological evolution of the universe with a bulk viscosity $naturally$ satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon, without imposing any exotic condition and for a general form of the coefficient of viscosity. This in turn affirms the thermodynamic correspondence of viscous cosmology.</description>

      <title>Leveraging cross-detector parameter consistency measures to enhance sensitivities of gravitational wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-sky searches for generic short-duration astrophysical GW transients are often challenging because of noise transients. Developing novel signal-noise discriminators is crucial for GW transient searches with LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In this work, we adapt a recently developed Jensen Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure, which assesses the cross-detector parameter consistency to distinguish between weakly modeled or unmodelled astrophysical GW signals and loud noise triggers. We first extend a 2-detector JSD-based measure, developed in an earlier work, to a 3-detector network. We leverage this to modify the test statistic of the existing Coherent Waveburst (cWB)-Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) algorithm for short-duration transients towards improving the search sensitivity to ad-hoc waveforms like Sine-Gaussians, Gaussian Pulses, and White Noise Bursts. We find that with the new method, which we term cWB-GMM-JSD, the sensitivity to the ad-hoc waveforms, given by $h_{\mathrm{rss50}}$, improves by $\sim 10-20 \%$ at an IFAR of 10 years for the 2-detector network consisting of LHO and LLO detectors, and by $\sim 5-10 \%$ at the same IFAR for the 3-detector network consisting of LHO, LLO and Virgo detectors. Finally, we apply the modified statistic in the revised data analysis pipeline on the publicly available data from the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Although we do not find any new event in the O3 data, we see a notable rise in the statistical significance of most of the known GW events, which further testifies to the enhancement in sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Is the information loss problem a paradox?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this chapter is twofold. First, we introduce the information loss problem; second, we provide a critical assessment by thoroughly inspecting the assumptions underlying its formulations. In particular, we argue that if we work in the regime of validity of semiclassical gravity and do not add additional assumptions that are not necessary for the Hawking calculation, the answer to the question in the title is NO. In other words, the black hole evaporation is certainly unitary as predicted by quantum field theory in curved spacetime. However, if additional assumptions are added, such as a universal area bound on the entropy, contradictions may arise even in regimes where we would expect the semiclassical approximation to be valid. We show that a contradiction indeed arises, but not between the laws of semiclassical general relativity and quantum mechanics, but rather between the former and the additional (holographic) requirement of the area limit, according to which an exterior observer describes a black hole as a quantum system whose entropy is bounded by its area.</description>

      <title>Acceleration from a Phase of Entropic Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of generating a cosmic inflation without any big bang singularity. It has been proved recently by Good and Linder (arXiv : 2503.02380v1) that such an expansion of the universe can be driven by quantum fluctuations embedded in vacuum. The rate of expansion is guided by a cosmological sum rule defined through the Schwarzian derivative. We explore the thermodynamic roots of Schwarzian and connect it with the surface gravity associated with an apparent horizon. In General Relativity the cosmological sum rule can be enforced only if the early universe is a Milne vacuum. We show that this restriction can be removed by considering an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>On-axis absorption and scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black-bounce spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black-bounce spacetime when the waves are incident along the rotation axis. We calculate the geometrical and glory scattering cross sections using the classical analytical method and the corresponding absorption and scattering cross sections using the partial wave method, and show that they are in excellent agreement. Our findings indicate that a faster (slower) rotating spacetime or a more repulsive (attractive) electric force tends to reduce (increase) the absorption cross section and result in larger (smaller) angular widths of the scattered wave oscillations. Additionally, the rotation parameter exerts a suppressive influence on superradiance, which contrasts with the enhancing effect of the repulsive electric force. The regularization parameter $k$ is found to modify the absorption or scattering cross sections only weakly, but can cause a noticeable reduction of the superradiance. For the effect of field mass, it is found that a heavier scalar field leads to a larger absorption cross section and a wider interference fringe of the differential scattering cross section. When superradiance happens, i.e., the absorption cross section becomes negative, it is also found that the differential scattering cross section only changes smoothly, with no apparent qualitative feature showing up.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Superradiant Cloud Level Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight boson clouds can form around black holes in binaries through superradiance, and undergo resonant level transitions at certain orbit frequencies. In this work, we investigate the gravitational waves emitted by the clouds during resonant level transitions, and forecast their detectability with future gravitational wave observations. We find that, for scalar fields of mass within $5 \times 10^{-13} - 5 \times 10^{-12}$ eV, clouds in stellar mass black hole binaries can radiate gravitational waves around $0.1$ Hz during hyperfine level transition, which can be detected with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and BBO, providing a potential way of searching for ultralight boson fields. We also consider the clouds in intermediate mass black hole binaries, which can emit milli-Hz gravitational waves during hyperfine level transition. The resulting gravitational waves, however, can be hardly detected with LISA-like detectors.</description>

      <title>Is the BKL map an intrinsic feature of the Quantum Mixmaster Universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum Mixmaster dynamics by constructing the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation as a relativistic quantum theory in a pseudo-Riemannian Mini-superspace. The transition amplitude from a Kasner regime to the next one is built via the standard S-matrix of a relativistic scattering, and mediated by a single wall potential. We provide a coherent and convincing representation of the original Misner's idea that quasi-classical states can survive arbitrarily close to the cosmological singularity. By constructing a complete set of states, we demonstrate that the quasi-classical BKL map is preserved by the resulting transition amplitude to a new state when their mean total momentum is high enough (exactly coinciding with Misner's high occupation numbers). This scheme is naturally iterated to the initial singularity without appreciable shape changes. We also clarify the role played by the state localization, and, in particular, we outline that when the incoming state is spread, the possibility of violating the Kasner map is no longer negligible. Thus, Kasner-like wave packets can approach the initial singularity.</description>

      <title>Finite-Distance Gravitational Lensing of a Global Monopole in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with a global monopole at finite distances. In this asymptotically nonflat spacetime, the deflection angle of light is decomposed into two parts: the first derives from the orbit differential equation, and the second originates from the metric itself. By absorbing the cosmological constant into the effective impact parameter, we derive an analytical expression for the first part using elliptic integrals. Combined with the second part, we obtain a complete exact solution for the deflection angle in this context. Additionally, considering that the distances from the source to the observer are large, we derive expressions for the light deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits. In both cases, we find that the deflection is enhanced by the presence of the global monopole, further supporting its potential role as an alternative to elusive dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining Scalar Charge in Neutron Stars through Gravitational Wave Signals from NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS) offer an exceptional opportunity to investigate gravitational physics in extreme environments. In the context of alternative theories of General Relativity (GR), a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity can lead to "hairy" NS solutions with a non-zero scalar charge. As a result, binary systems containing at least one "hairy" NS can serve as probes for testing GR through observations. In this work, we analyze the gravitational wave signals from four neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH) merger events: GW190814, GW200115, GW200105, and GW230529 examine the "hairy" NS hypothesis predicted by the luminal Horndeski theories. Our analysis constrains the scalar charge to be on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$, with the most stringent limit arising from the recent GW230529 event. In addition, we discuss the implications of our results in relation to the scalarized NS solutions found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical boundary induced current in the cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum current associated with a charged bosonic field operator, induced by a cylindrical boundary in the idealized cosmic string spacetime. In this setup we assume that the cylindrical boundary is coaxial with the string, that by its turn carry a magnetic flux along its core. In order to develop this analysis, we calculate the positive frequency Wightman functions for both regions, inside and outside the boundary. Moreover, we assume that the bosonic field obeys the Robin boundary condition on the cylindrical shell. Using this approach, the analytical expressions for the vacuum bosonic currents are presented in the form of the sum of boundary-free and boundary-induced parts. Because the boundary-free contribution is very well established in literature, our focus here is in the boundary-dependent part. As we will see, our general results are presented in a cylindrically symmetric static structure. Some asymptotic behaviors for the boundary-induced vacuum currents are investigated in various limiting cases. In order to provide a better understanding of these currents, we provide some graphs exhibiting their behavior as function of the distance to the string's core, and on the intensity of the magnetic flux running along it. These plots also present how the parameter associated with the planar angle deficit interfere in the intensity of the corresponding current.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Lensed Quasar Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are key to many areas of study in astronomy, offering a unique probe into the intermediate and far universe. However, finding lensed quasars has proved difficult despite significant efforts from large collaborations. These challenges have limited catalogues of confirmed lensed quasars to the hundreds, despite theoretical predictions that they should be many times more numerous. We train machine learning classifiers to discover lensed quasar candidates. By using semi-supervised learning techniques we leverage the large number of potential candidates as unlabelled training data alongside the small number of known objects, greatly improving model performance. We present our two most successful models: (1) a variational autoencoder trained on millions of quasars to reduce the dimensionality of images for input to a gradient boosting classifier that can make accurate predictions and (2) a convolutional neural network trained on a mix of labelled and unlabelled data via virtual adversarial training. These models are both capable of producing high-quality candidates, as evidenced by our discovery of GRALJ140833.73+042229.98. The success of our classifier, which uses only images, is particularly exciting as it can be combined with existing classifiers, which use other data than images, to improve the classifications of both models and discover more lensed quasars.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Virial Theorem, Limiting Compactness, and the end state of gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is noteworthy that limiting compactness of a static bounded configuration is characterized by a general principle: \textit{one, by equipartition of mass between inside and outside, and the other by vanishing of energy inside.} The former implies gravitational energy being half of mass leading to limiting compactness $M/R = 4/9$ of Buchdahl star while for the latter, the two are equal giving $M/R = 1/2$ of black hole with horizon. \emph{This is the relativistic Virial theorem respectively for massive and massless particles.} It is remarkable that it prescribes that there can exist only two equilibrium states which also define limiting compactness of the object. Consequently, it leads to a profound prediction that the ultimate endproduct of gravitational collapse could only be one of the two, Buchdahl star or black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize and extend results on the localization of gravity on Karch-Randall-Sundrum brane-worlds with positive, negative, or zero cosmological constant on the brane. We do so both from the study of bulk metric perturbations, and from their reinterpretation through brane-world holography: an induced higher-derivative theory of gravity coupled to a cut-off CFT on the brane. We then enhance these models by adding an explicit Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane action (i.e. a DGP term) and, through studying the brane position and the localization of gravity on the brane, we establish bounds for its coupling constant, beyond which the theory presents pathologies. We finally study the limit in which the brane reaches the boundary, and comment on adding further higher-derivative terms on the brane action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the construction of a free differential algebra as an extension of the extended Bargmann algebra in arbitrary dimensions. This is achieved by introducing a new Maurer-Cartan equation for a three-form gauge multiplet in the adjoint representation of the extended Bargmann algebra. The new Maurer-Cartan equation is provided of non-triviality by means of the introduction of a four-form cocycle, representative of a Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology class. We derive the corresponding dual $L_{\infty}$ algebra and, by using the formalism of non-linear realizations, propose a five-dimensional gauge invariant action principle. Then, we derive the corresponding equations of motion and study how the presence of the three-form gauge fields and the four-cocycle modify the corresponding non-relativistic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay, we argue that the problem of time should not be regarded as an issue to be resolved within the prevailing framework for studying quantum gravity, but rather as an indication that there is an issue within the framework itself. We suggest a possible resolution inspired by the observation that the quantization of gravity on null hypersurfaces leads to an anomaly, in that the constraint algebra is projectively represented in the quantum theory. We describe how accommodating these anomalies forces the theory to replace the standard interpretation of canonical time evolution with a fully quantum, diffeomorphism invariant notion of time. The full theory admits states that can be interpreted as emergent geometric spacetime regions which we refer to as quantum diamonds.</description>

Abstract: The generalized free energy landscape plays a pivotal role in understanding black hole thermodynamics and phase transitions. In general relativity, one can directly derive the generalized free energy from the contributions of black holes exhibiting conical singularities. In this work, we extend this idea to general covariant theories. By employing Noether's second theorem, we present an alternative formulation of the Lagrangian, which can elucidate the role of conical singularities. We demonstrate that, in general, the contribution from conical singularities depends on the specific implementation of the regularization scheme and is not uniquely determined; this feature is explicitly exhibited and confirmed in three-dimensional new massive gravity. Nevertheless, these ambiguities can be absorbed into the second-order (and higher) corrections induced by conical singularities when the gravitational theory is described by the Lagrangian $L(g_{ab},R_{abcd})$. Moreover, for certain theories such as general relativity and Bumblebee gravity, this contribution simplifies to a well-defined result. However, the interpretation of the generalized free energy in Bumblebee gravity is somewhat different, with its extrema corresponding to the geometry of conical singularities. Our results uncover the particular properties of the generalized free energy beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at the first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a Non-Commutative Black Hole under the Influence of a Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the shadow cast by a black hole in a non-commutative spacetime surrounded by a plasma medium. Black holes in a plasma environment can exhibit complex interactions that profoundly affect their shadow properties. In specific terms, we consider a special type of plasma medium motivated from the interactions among axions, photons and plasma excitations, or commonly termed as axion-plasmon in the presence of a magnetic field. We have studied the effect of these plasma parameters and the non-commutative parameter on the shadow properties by focusing particularly the photon sphere radius, angular shadow and the shadow observed from the observer's perspective. For this we have considered two different forms of plasma \emph{viz.} homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma. In this work we have presented the parameter dependence of these BH shadow properties.</description>

      <title>De Sitter vacuum on nucleated D-branes with stringy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) vacuum solutions on probe D-branes which nucleate in an asymptotically $\text{AdS}_5\times T^{1,1}$ background, including stringy corrections. A sufficiently high chemical potential induced by the wrapped D3-brane charge, breaking supersymmetry in the bulk, is essential to lead to the nucleation of the probe D-brane. We show that stringy corrections can yield a dS vacuum on a spherical D3-brane consistent with the observations without being fine-tuned. Motivated by the fact that the matter fields propagating in the compact extra dimensions can provide solutions for problems in particle physics and cosmology, we also construct a dS vacuum on a probe D5-brane which wraps on a two-torus of the internal manifold $T^{1,1}$. This construction requires turning on a worldvolume U(1) gauge field along the wrapped part of the D5-brane and dissolving some D3-branes in it. The stringy corrections play an important role in yielding a dS vacuum and the field strength of the U(1) gauge field must be sufficiently large to produce a tiny cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter coupled via QCD induces a non-zero differential acceleration between test masses of different composition. Tests of the equivalence principle, like the recent MICROSCOPE space mission, are sensitive to such a signal. We use the final released data of the MICROSCOPE experiment, to search for this effect. We find no positive signal consistent with the dark matter model, and set upper limits on the axion-gluon coupling that improve existing laboratory bounds by up to two orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-17}$ eV to $10^{-13}$ eV range.</description>

      <title>One-parameter dynamical dark energy: Hints for oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence from multiple cosmological probes that dark energy may be dynamical, with an equation of state that evolves over cosmic time. While this evidence is typically quantified using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, based on a linear expansion of $w(a)$ in the scale factor, non-parametric reconstructions frequently suggest non-linear features, particularly at late times. In this work, we investigate four minimal one-parameter models of dark energy with non-linear dependence on the scale factor. These models are constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck, lensing reconstruction from ACT-DR6, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI-DR2, and three Type-Ia supernovae (SNe) samples (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), considered independently. Although our conclusions depend on the choice of SNe sample, we consistently find a preference, as measured by the chi-squared statistic and the Bayesian evidence, for these dynamical dark energy models over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, with the PantheonPlus dataset, one model shows strong Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln B \simeq 4.5$) against CPL, favoring an equation of state that peaks near $a \simeq 0.7$ and oscillates near the present day. These results highlight the impact of SNe selection and contribute to the growing collection of evidence for late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The phase of the gravitational path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path integral on $S^2 \times S^2$ can be interpreted either as evaluating a contribution to the norm of the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction conditional on spatial $S^1 \times S^2$ topology, or the pair creation rate of black holes in de Sitter. Both interpretations are distinguished at the quantum level. The former requires the path integral to be real and the latter to be imaginary. We develop a formalism to efficiently compute the phase of the gravitational path integral on Einstein spaces. We apply it to a broad class of spacetimes and in particular $S^2\times S^{D-2}$, finding it to be real and positive. We generalize some of the analysis to cases with charge and rotation.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation from Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LV) is examined through the time delay between high-energy and low-energy photons in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous studies determined the LV energy scale as $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.60 \times 10^{17}$~GeV using Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) data. This study updates the time-delay model and reaffirms these findings with new observations. High-energy photons from GRBs at GeV and TeV bands are analyzed, including the 99.3 GeV photon from GRB 221009A (FGST), the 1.07 TeV photon from GRB 190114C (MAGIC), and the 12.2 TeV photon from GRB 221009A (LHAASO). Our analysis, in conjunction with previous data, consistently shows that high-energy photons are emitted earlier than low-energy photons at the source. By evaluating 17 high-energy photons from 10 GRBs observed by FGST, MAGIC, and LHAASO, we estimate the LV energy scale to be $E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3.00 \times 10^{17}$ GeV. The null hypothesis of dispersion-free vacuum $E=pc$ (or, equivalently, the constant light-speed $v_{\gamma}=c$) is rejected at a significance level of 3.1$\sigma$ or higher.</description>

      <title>Topological Electroweak Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we shall consider the effects of a non-trivial topology on the effective potential of the Standard Model. Specifically we shall assume that the spacetime topology is $S^1\times R^3$ and we shall calculate the Standard Model effective potential for such a topological spacetime. As we demonstrate, for small values of the compact dimension radius, the electroweak symmetry is unbroken, but for a critical length and beyond, the electroweak symmetry is broken, since the configuration space of the Higgs field contains an additional energetically favorable minimum, compared to the minimum at the origin. The two minima are separated by a barrier, thus a phase transition can occur, via quantum tunnelling, which mimics a first order phase transition. This is a non-thermal phase transition, similar possibly to quantum Hall topological phase transitions, hence in the context of this scenario, the electroweak symmetry breaking does not require a high temperature to occur. The present scenario does not rely on the occurrence of the inflationary era, only on the expansion of the Universe, however we briefly discuss the freezing of the superhorizon terms in $S^1\times R^3$ spacetime, if inflation occurred. We also investigate the large scale differences of the gravitational potential due to the non-trivial topology. Finally, we briefly mention the distinct inequivalent topological field configurations that can exist due to the non-trivial topology, which are classified by the first Stieffel class which in the case at hand is $H^{1}(S^{1}{\times R}^{3},Z_{\widetilde{2}})=Z_2$, so even and odd elements can exist. We also briefly qualitatively discuss how a topologically induced electroweak phase transition can yield primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), both with and without calibration by SH0ES, and finally the CMB data from Planck 2018. For the basic and simplest interacting model, we find that the data favor a non-zero interaction up to $2\sigma$. Notably, when we employ SH0ES-calibrated SNIa data the preference of non-zero interaction becomes more significant. However, comparison with $\Lambda$CDM scenario through AIC, BIC and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the basic theory of mimetic gravity by extending its purview to the general metric-compatible geometries that admit torsion, in addition to curvature. This essentially implies reinstating the mimetic principle of isolating the conformal degree of freedom of gravity in presence of torsion, by parametrizing both the physical metric and torsion in terms of the scalar `mimetic' field and the metric and torsion of a fiducial space. We assert the requisite torsion parametrization from an inspection of the fiducial space Cartan transformation which, together with the conformal transformation of the fiducial metric, preserve the physical metric and torsion. In formulating the scalar-tensor equivalent Lagrangian, we consider an explicit contact coupling of the mimetic field with torsion, so that the former can manifest itself geometrically as the source of a torsion mode, and most importantly, give rise to a viable `dark universe' picture from a mimicry of an evolving dust-like cosmological fluid with a non-zero pressure. A further consideration of higher derivatives of the mimetic field in the Lagrangian leads to physical bounds on the mimetic-torsion coupling strength, which we determine explicitly.</description>

      <title>Mimetic-Metric-Torsion with induced Axial mode and Phantom barrier crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the basic formalism of mimetic-metric-torsion gravity theory, in a way that the mimetic scalar field can manifest itself geometrically as the source of not only the trace mode of torsion, but also its axial (or, pseudo-trace) mode. Specifically, we consider the mimetic field to be (i) coupled explicitly to the well-known Holst extension of the Riemann-Cartan action, and (ii) identified with the square of the associated Barbero-Immirzi field, which is presumed to be a pseudo-scalar. The conformal symmetry originally prevalent in the theory would still hold, as the associated Cartan transformations do not affect the torsion pseudo-trace, and hence the Holst term. Demanding the theory to preserve the spatial parity symmetry as well, we focus on a geometric unification of the cosmological dark sector, and show that a super-accelerating regime in the course of evolution of the universe is always feasible. From the observational perspective, assuming the cosmological evolution profile to be very close to that for $\L$CDM, we further show that there could be a smooth crossing of the so-called phantom barrier at a low red-shift, however for a very restricted parametric domain. The extent of the super-acceleration have subsequently been ascertained by examining the evolution of the relevant torsion parameters.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic rigidity of extremal horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of any vacuum extremal horizon must admit a Killing vector field. If the cross-sections are two-dimensional spheres, this implies that the most general solution is the extremal Kerr horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant. Furthermore, we also deduce that any non-trivial vacuum near-horizon geometry, with a non-positive cosmological constant, must have a Lie algebra of Killing vector fields that contains $\mathfrak{sl}(2)\times \mathfrak{u}(1)$ in all dimensions under no symmetry assumptions. We also show that, if the cross-sections are two-dimensional, the horizon Einstein equation is equivalent to a single fourth order PDE for the K\"ahler potential, and that this equation is explicitly solvable on the sphere if the corresponding metric admits a Killing vector.</description>

Abstract: We study the lensing phenomena of the strong gravity regime of five-dimensional charged, equally rotating black holes with a cosmological constant, familiarly known as the Cveti\v c-L\"u-Pope black holes. These black holes are characterized by three observable parameters, the mass $M$, the charge $Q$ and the angular momentum $J$, in addition to the cosmological constant. We investigate the strong gravitational lensing observables, mainly the photon sphere radius, the minimum impact parameter, the deflection angle, the angular size, and the magnification of the relativistic images. We model the $M87$ and $SgrA^*$ for these observables. We also focus on the relativistic time delay effect in the strong-field regime of gravity and the impact of the observable on it. The analytical expressions for the observables of the relativistic images with vanishing angular momentum ($j=0$) are discussed in some detail. We shed a light on the gravitational time delay effect by incorporating the lensing observables. The gravitational time delay has a direct consequence on the photon sphere radius and hence on the quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>n-dimensional non-commutative GUP quantization and application to the Bianchi I model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a n-dimensional Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) quantization framework, characterized by a non-commutative nature of the configurational variables. First, we identify a set of states which are maximally localized only along a single direction, at the expense of being less localized in all the other ones. Subsequently, in order to recover information about localization on the whole configuration space, we use the only state of the theory which exhibits maximal localization simultaneously in every direction to construct a satisfactory quasi-position representation, by virtue of a suitable translational operator. The resultant quantum framework is then applied to model the dynamics of the Bianchi I cosmology. The corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation is reduced to Schr\"odinger dynamics for the two anisotropy degrees of freedom, using a WKB representation for the volume-like variable of the Universe, in accordance with the Vilenkin scenario. The main result of our cosmological implementation of the constructed quantum theory demonstrates how the dynamics of a wave packet peaked at some point in the configuration space represented in the quasi-position variables, favours as the most probable configuration exactly the initial one for a relatively long time, if compared with the ordinary quantum theory. This preference arises from the distinct behavioral dynamics exhibited by wave packets in the two quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

      <title>Ultralight scalar dark matter versus nonadiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent evidence for stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can induce the Newtonian potential and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. We show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations in the PTA frequency band and considering the known distances of pulsars. For scalar dark matter, both the timing residuals and the angular correlation are sensitive to small variations in the distance, $\delta L$, due to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$. In contrast, for perfect fluid dark matter, it is insensitive to the $\delta L$. For deterministic sources from scalar dark matter, the distance of a pulsar has influence on the degree of directional dependence of timing residuals, significantly. For stochastic sources from perfect fluid dark matter, the angular correlation tends to a constant and enhances only when the pulsar pair is very close to each other. In this sense, perfect fluid dark matter is shown to be a more suitable physical origin for monopolar signals in angular correlations compared to the scalar dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degrees of freedom in New General Relativity -- flat and metric compatible family of theories -- around the Minkowski background in a gauge invariant manner. First, we confirm the decoupling case, in which the theory reduces to linearized gravity plus a massless KR field. We then show that, unless they vanish, the vector modes of this theory will be unstable. In addition, we find two new branches of the theories, which are instability-free and propagate linearly two tensor modes and in one of the cases also a massless scalar field. This shows that while the generic theory is ill-behaved, there are three possible realizations of instability-free cases, in contradiction to the previous literature, which states that there is only one healthy theory in addition to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering of massive scalar field due to magnetically charged rotating black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes are well known to amplify the perturbing bosonic fields in certain parameter spaces. This phenomenon is popularly known as superradiance. In addition to rotation in the spacetime, charge plays a crucial role in the amplification process. In the present study, we have considered the spacetime of a magnetically charged rotating black hole emerging from the coupling of nonlinear electromagnetic field configuration to gravity. Due to this black hole spacetime, we have studied the scattering states of a massive scalar field and investigated the superradiant amplification process. We find that the magnetic charge of the spacetime affects the magnitude of the amplification and also significantly enlarges the allowed frequency ranges for which superradiance happens. In comparison, our analysis reveals that some of the behaviours are quite similar to what has been found in the case of the Kerr-Newmann black hole. Moreover, in specific parameter spaces, we observe exact similarities, which could imply a probable correspondence between the magnetically charged black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole in certain scenarios. In addition to this, we have investigated the superradiant instability regime due to the massive potential barrier and also compared our results with that of the Kerr-Newmann black hole.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove the Riemannian analog of black hole mode stability for Hermitian, non-self-dual gravitational instantons which are either asymptotically locally flat (ALF) and Ricci-flat, or compact and Einstein with positive cosmological constant. We show that the Teukolsky equation on any such manifold is a positive definite operator. We also discuss the compatibility of the results with the existence of negative modes associated to variational instabilities.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical expressions for the fluxes of energy and angular momentum from a point mass on an inclined spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole. The expressions are obtained using the method of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi to construct analytical solutions of the Teukolsky equation, and are given as post-Newtonian expansions valid through 12PN, with arbitrary values for the inclination parameter $x$ and black hole spin $a$. We characterize the structure of the PN expansions in terms of their dependence on $x$ and $a$, and we validate our results against numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Can Neutron Star Tidal Effects Obscure Deviations from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main goals of gravitational-wave astrophysics is to study gravity in the strong-field regime and constrain deviations from general relativity (GR). Any such deviation affects not only binary dynamics and gravitational-wave emission but also the structure and tidal properties of compact objects. In the case of neutron stars, masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities can all differ significantly between different theories of gravity. Currently, the measurement uncertainties in neutron star radii and tidal deformabilities are quite large. However, much less is known about how the large uncertainty in the nuclear equation of state (EOS) might affect tests of GR using binary neutron star mergers. Conversely, using the wrong theory of gravity might lead to incorrect constraints on the nuclear EOS. Here, we study this problem within scalar-tensor (ST) theory. We apply the recently derived $\ell = 2$ tidal Love numbers in this theory to parameter estimation of GW170817. Correspondingly, we test if physics beyond GR could bias measurements of the nuclear EOS and neutron star radii. We find that parameter inference for both the GR and ST cases return consistent component masses and tidal deformabilities. The radius and the EOS posteriors, however, differ between the two theories, but neither is excluded by current observational limits. This indicates that measurements of the nuclear EOS may be biased and that deviations from GR could go undetected when analyzing current binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from Loop Quantum Black Holes: The Role of Magnetic Penrose Process and Quantum Gravity Effects with Astrophysical Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the influence of quantum gravitational corrections, derived from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), on the efficiency of the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in black hole (BH) environments. We begin by analyzing the rotating Loop Quantum Black Hole (LQBH) metric, describing the structure of the event horizon and ergosphere as functions of the quantum parameter $\epsilon = \gamma \delta$, with $\gamma$ representing the Immirzi parameter and $\delta$ the polymeric parameter, and the spin parameter $a$. These modifications provide a novel setting for exploring the dynamics of charged particles near the LQBH and evaluating the resultant energy extraction through the MPP. Interestingly, for a given value of the LQBH parameter $a$, we observe that the ergosphere region of the LQBH exhibits a more intricate structure compared to its classical counterpart, the Kerr BH, as $\epsilon$ increases. Furthermore, we find that the overall efficiency of the process decreases with $\epsilon$ that decreases $a_{max}$, again in contrast to the Kerr BH, where efficiency rises with an increasing $a$. Our analysis also extends to astrophysical contexts, applying constraints on the mass and magnetic field of LQBHs for astrophysical BH candidates, including SgrA*, M87*, NGC 1052, and BZ (Blandford and Znajek sources, i.e., supermassive BHs with masses around $10^9 M_\odot$ and magnetic fields in the range $10^3-10^4 \text{G}$). We assess these sources as potential accelerators of high-energy protons across different values of the quantum parameter $\epsilon$. Additionally, we examine how variations in the magnetic field strength $B$ and quantum corrections impact the energy of protons accelerated from M87$^{\star}$ and Sgr A$^{\star}$ following beta decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime, but rather as the finite-dimensional configuration space of a single "atom" of geometry). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between classical thermodynamics and black hole horizons is a fundamental topic in gravitational physics, offering a potential pathway to understanding quantum aspects of gravity. However, while black hole mechanics exhibits well-known thermodynamic parallels, a rigorous geometric interpretation of thermodynamic variables directly from the field equations warrants further research. In this manuscript, we present a thermodynamic formulation of the field equations through the decomposition of the Riemann tensor, employing the Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalism, to clarify a strong correspondence between black hole thermodynamic variables and geometrical quantities derived from horizon geometry. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic connection between the Penrose and Rindler $K$-curvature and the Smarr relation, motivating a revised definition of both trapping gravity and black hole internal energy. Additionally, we derive through this GHP formalism the Smarr formula for the Reissner-N\"ordstrom black hole cointained in an AdS spacetime and we explore the implications of this relationship for black holes with exotic topologies and in the context of extended theories, exemplified by $f(R)$ gravity. These findings suggest a deeper geometrical basis for black hole thermodynamics, potentially advancing our understanding of gravitational energy, horizon entropy, and their significance within quantum gravity frameworks.</description>

Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both a perfect experiment, and for a realistic pulsar noise model. For a perfect experiment, we show that the SNR grows with the observation time and the number of frequency bins, in turn determined by the cadence of observation. For an imperfect experiment, the behaviour is similar, with an effective multipole-dependent number of frequency, obtained after weighting with noise. We predict that with $\sim 200$ pulsars monitored for $25$ years, multipoles of the HD correlation up to $\ell=4$ can be measured. Our findings clarify that is called \emph{cosmic variance} in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, with optimal estimators, it can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation. We also discuss the case in which the graviton distribution function is anisotropic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dominant physical effects of superhorizon fluctuations in a flat FLRW universe, focusing on whether the combined evolution of scalar and tensor adiabatic modes in the near-horizon regime could lead to geometries beyond those predicted by the conventional separate-universe approach. Assuming a matter-dominated universe and working to first order in perturbations but second order in a gradient expansion, we identify modes that are either pure gauge or unsourced, making them observationally irrelevant. This allows us to derive an effective metric that preserves the spatial symmetries of three well-known Bianchi cosmologies, namely, types I, V, and IX. In this framework, scalar perturbations induce spatial curvature, while the shear arises from long-wavelength tensor perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The properties of a star with constant positive energy density inside (as for the Schwarzschild interior geometry) and a negative pressure are investigated, using a static conformally flat spacetime. Because of the negative pressure, the gravitational field inside is repulsive. Ricci and Kretschmann curvature invariants are finite. The energy conditions for the stress tensor of the perfect fluid are satisfied, excepting the strong energy condition which is not obeyed for $r&lt;R/\sqrt{2}$, where $R$ is the radius of the object. The Komar mass is calculated and discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravitational corrections to Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole thermodynamics and their implications for the weak gravity conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak gravity conjecture posits that there should exist at least one state with a charge-to-mass ratio $q/M&gt;1$, ensuring that an extremal charged black hole can still decay. In this paper, we investigate the corrections to the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes within the framework of effective field theory. The effective action originates from integrating out massless particles, including gravitons, at the one-loop level. We perform a complete thermodynamic analysis for both non-extremal and extremal black holes. For non-extremal black holes, we identify a relationship between the shift in the charge-to-mass ratio and the thermodynamic stability of the black holes. For extremal black holes, we show that quantum gravity effects naturally lead to the super-extremality of charged black holes, which aligns with known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A comparison between best-fit eccentricity definitions and the standardized definition of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of a unique, gauge-independent definition of eccentricity in General Relativity, there have been efforts to standardize the definition for Gravitational-Wave astronomy. Recently, Shaikh et al. proposed a model-independent measurement of eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ from the phase evolution of the dominant mode. Many works use loss functions (LFs) to assign eccentricity to a reference waveform, for instance by fitting a Post-Newtonian expression to assign eccentricity to Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. Therefore, we ask whether minimizing common LFs on gauge-dependent model parameters, such as the mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ or the $L_2$-norm of the dominant mode $h_{22}$ residuals, for non-precessing binaries, ensures a sufficient $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ agreement. We use $10$ eccentric NR simulations and the eccentric waveform TEOBResumS-Dali as the parametric model to fit on eccentricity $e_0$ and reference frequency $f_0$. We first show that a minimized mismatch, the $\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{-3}- 10^{-2}$ results in better $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ fractional differences ($\sim 1\%$) than with the minimized $h_{22}$ residuals. Nonetheless, for small eccentricity NR simulations $(e_{\mathrm{gw}} \lesssim 10^{-2}$), the mismatch can favor quasi-circular ($e_0=0$) best-fit models. Thus, with sufficiently long NR simulations, we can include $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ in the LF. We explain why solely fitting with $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ constitutes a degenerate problem. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to minimize a convex sum of $\mathcal{M}$ and the $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ difference to both assign non-zero eccentric values to NR strains and to control the mismatch threshold.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>

      <title>Von Neumann Algebras in Double-Scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit \cite{Lin:2022nss}. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature \cite{Witten:2023xze}, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from \cite{Lin:2022rbf}. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Formalism: Joint Measurement for Heisenberg's Uncertainty Relation for Errors by Squeezed Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the Gaussian wave-packet formalism can serve as a concrete realization of the joint measurement of position and momentum, which is an essential element in understanding Heisenberg's original philosophy of the uncertainty principle, in line with the universal framework of error, disturbance, and their uncertainty relations developed by Lee and Tsutsui. We show that our joint measurement in the Gaussian phase space, being a Positive-Operator-Valued-Measure (POVM) measurement, smoothly interpolates between the projective measurements of position and momentum. We, for the first time, have obtained the Lee-Tsutsui (LT) error and the refined Lee error for the position-momentum measurement. We find that the LT uncertainty relation becomes trivial, 0 = 0, in the limiting case of projective measurement of either position or momentum. Remarkably, in contrast to the LT relation, the refined Lee uncertainty relation, which assesses errors for local representability, provides a constant lower bound unaffected by these limits and is invariably saturated, for a pure Gaussian initial state. The obtained lower bound is in agreement with Heisenberg's value.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers and for arbitrary global physical states), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the `observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we postulate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities, identifying those quantization prescriptions for which this holds true.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuations of holographic entanglement entropy in which the boundary subregion extends along a timelike direction have brought a promise of a novel, time-centric probe of the emergence of spacetime. We propose that the bulk carriers of this holographic timelike entanglement entropy are boundary-anchored extremal surfaces probing analytic continuation of holographic spacetimes into complex coordinates. This proposal not only provides a geometric interpretation of all the known cases obtained by direct analytic continuation of closed-form expressions of holographic entanglement entropy of a strip subregion but crucially also opens a window to study holographic timelike entanglement entropy in full generality. We initialize the investigation of complex extremal surfaces anchored on a timelike strip at the boundary of anti-de Sitter black branes. We find multiple complex extremal surfaces and discuss possible principles singling out the physical contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that all the models exhibit similar nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the inflation model at small field values, which is governed by the parameter $n$, exerts a more substantial influence on the nonlinear dynamics. The behavior at large field values, controlled by the parameter $q$, has a negligible impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

Abstract: By introducing the small noise expansion techniques, we show that the fully nonlinear (non-Markovian) stochastic inflationary system, may be re-cast in terms of an infinite set of Wiener processes (stochastic equations with white noises). As a byproduct, we show that the Starobinsky test field approximation might only provide information about the linear regime of cosmological perturbations and scalar-feld non-Gaussianities might only appear at leading order in slow-roll parameters.</description>

      <title>The Born approximation in wave optics gravitational lensing revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information about lensed gravitational waves is encapsulated by an amplification factor, which is calculated by an integration of an oscillatory function. The Born approximation, which has been studied in terms of wave optics in gravitational lensing, may provide a means of overcoming the difficulty in evaluating the oscillating function and better understanding the connection between the amplification factor and the lens mass distribution. In this paper, we revisit the Born approximation for a single lens plane. We find that the distortion of gravitational waves induced by wave optics gravitational lensing is in general connected with the mass distribution of the lens object through a convolution integral, where the scale of the kernel is determined by the Fresnel scale. We then study the validity and accuracy of the Born approximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the exact analytical expression of the amplification factor is available. Using the dimensionless parameter $y$, which represents the normalized impact parameter, and the dimensionless parameter $w$, which denotes the normalized frequency, we show that the $n$-th term of the Born approximation scales as $y^{-2}w^{n-1}$. This indicates that, for the case of a point mass lens, the Born approximation is valid when $w$ is less than 1, with its accuracy scaling as $wy^{-2}$ in this regime.</description>

Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience type IIA string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time. By taking another solution in the same theory, one can create an arbitrarily large region where a local observer will experience type IIB string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>
