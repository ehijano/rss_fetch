      <title>Digital twin with automatic disturbance detection for real-time optimization of a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the development and validation of a digital twin for a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill controlled by an expert control system. The digital twin consists of three interconnected modules that emulate the behavior of a closed-loop system: (1) fuzzy logic for the expert control system, (2) a state-space model for the regulatory control, and (3) a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the SAG mill process. The model was trained with data corresponding to 68 hours of operation and validated with 8 hours of test data. The digital twin predicts the dynamic behavior of the mill's bearing pressure, motor power, tonnage, solids percentage, and rotational speed within a 2.5-minute horizon with a 30-second sampling time. The RNN comprises two serial modules for detection and training. The disturbance detection evaluates the need for training by comparing the recent prediction error with the expected error using hypothesis tests for mean, variance, and probability distribution. If the detection module is activated, the parameters of the neural model are re-estimated with recent data. The detection module was configured with test data to eliminate false positives. Results indicate that the digital twin can satisfactorily supervise the SAG mill, which is operated with the expert control system. Future work will focus on integrating this digital twin into real-time optimization strategies with industrial validation.</description>

      <title>On Simulation of Power Systems and Microgrid Components with SystemC-AMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems such as microgrids consist of interconnected components, localized power systems, and distributed energy resources with clearly defined electrical boundaries. They can function independently but can also work in tandem with the main grid. Power system converters and their control loops play an essential role in stabilizing grids and interfacing a microgrid with the main grid. The optimal selection of microgrid components for installation is expensive. Simulation of microgrids provides a cost-effective solution. However, when studying the electromagnetic transient response, their simulation is slow. Furthermore, software packages facilitating electromagnetic transient response may be prohibitively expensive. This paper presents a faster method for simulating the electromagnetic transient response of microgrid components using SystemC-AMS. We present a use case of a photovoltaic grid-following inverter with a phase-locked loop to track reference active and reactive power. Our results demonstrate that the simulation performed using SystemC-AMS is roughly three times faster than the benchmark simulation conducted using Simulink. Our implementation of a photovoltaic grid-following inverter equipped with a phase-locked loop for monitoring reference active and reactive power reveals that the simulation executed using SystemC-AMS is approximately three times faster than the benchmark simulation carried out using Simulink. Our implementation adopts a model-based design and produces a library of components that can be used to construct increasingly complex grid architectures. Additionally, the C-based nature allows for the integration of external libraries for added real-time capability and optimization functionality. We also present a use case for real-time simulation using a DC microgrid with a constant resistive load.</description>

      <title>On the Scientific Method: The Role of Hypotheses and Involved Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many scientific problems aim to evaluate the function fo relating variables u and y measured from a physical phenomenon. An exact knowledge of fo cannot be expected, and many methods are used for deriving approximate functions fa giving small error fo-fa. It is shown that deriving functions fa having finite error is not possible using measured data only, and hypothesis, i.e., assumptions, on the function fo and on the disturbances corrupting the measurements must be introduced. Two main classes of assumptions are used in the literature. The most widely used is the Parametric Stochastic class, where fo is assumed to be a function depending on a vector p and disturbances are stochastic variables. In last decades, assumptions belonging to Set Membership class have been investigated, where fo is assumed to a smooth function with bounded smoothness parameter and disturbances are bounded variables. At first, it is shown that SM methods achieve "theoretical" properties (e.g., finding fa with known and minimal error error, if assumptions hold) for general nonlinear assumptions on function fo, while are achieved by PS methods under very restricted assumptions on fo. Then, it is proved that no method can be found for validating PS or SM assumptions, so that at best the chosen assumptions can be falsified, i.e. recognized not true. No falsification test of PS assumptions is known, for general nonlinear assumptions on fo. A falsification test of SM assumptions is proposed. Finally, the new class of Physical Set Membership assumptions is proposed, able to integrate the information provided by a function fp obtained by a PS method, with a suitably designed SM method. It is shown that PSM methods enjoy the strong results of SM methods on theoretical properties and assumption falsification, and that, making use of the information provided by fp, may be more accurate than using only SM assumptions.</description>

      <title>Communication and Control Co-Design in 6G: Sequential Decision-Making with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates a control system within the context of six-generation wireless networks. The control performance optimization confronts the technical challenges that arise from the intricate interactions between communication and control sub-systems, asking for a co-design. Accounting for the system dynamics, we formulate the sequential co-design decision-makings of communication and control over the discrete time horizon as a Markov decision process, for which a practical offline learning framework is proposed. Our proposed framework integrates large language models into the elements of reinforcement learning. We present a case study on the age of semantics-aware communication and control co-design to showcase the potentials from our proposed learning framework. Furthermore, we discuss the open issues remaining to make our proposed offline learning framework feasible for real-world implementations, and highlight the research directions for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Multi-Modal Learning Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Learning Model Predictive Controller (LMPC) for multi-modal systems performing iterative control tasks. Assuming availability of historical data, our goal is to design a data-driven control policy for the multi-modal system where the current mode is unknown. First, we propose a novel method to select local data for constructing affine time-varying (ATV) models of a multi-modal system in the context of LMPC. Then we present how to build a sampled safe set from multi-modal historical data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation results of automated driving on a friction-varying track.</description>

      <title>Fast Distributed Optimization over Directed Graphs under Malicious Attacks using Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Resilient Projected Push-Pull (RP3) algorithm designed for distributed optimization in multi-agent cyber-physical systems with directed communication graphs and the presence of malicious agents. Our algorithm leverages stochastic inter-agent trust values and gradient tracking to achieve geometric convergence rates in expectation even in adversarial environments. We introduce growing constraint sets to limit the impact of the malicious agents without compromising the geometric convergence rate of the algorithm. We prove that RP3 converges to the nominal optimal solution almost surely and in the $r$-th mean for any $r\geq 1$, provided the step sizes are sufficiently small and the constraint sets are appropriately chosen. We validate our approach with numerical studies on average consensus and multi-robot target tracking problems, demonstrating that RP3 effectively mitigates the impact of malicious agents and achieves the desired geometric convergence.</description>

      <title>Learning operando impedance function for battery health with aging-aware equivalent circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide usage of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) requires a deep understanding about battery health. Estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH) is a crucial but yet still challenging task. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and instability of parameter estimations in lifelong aging. While pure data-driven methods rely heavily on quality and quantity of training set, causing lack of generality when extrapolating into unseen cases. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware equivalent circuit model (ECM), which combines model-based and data-driven techniques for SOH estimation. Gaussian process (GP) regression is incorporated in ECM to modelling parameters dependency on operating condition and aging time. The state space formulation of GP is used to enable a computationally efficient co-estimation framework of both parameters and states. Samples from two Open datasets are used to validate model performance, which gives accurate estimation for capacity and impedance. The learnt impedance function can be lined to the shape change of open circuit voltage (OCV) versus SOC curve and thus providing a way to further estimate changes of differential voltage (dV/dQ) curves.</description>

      <title>Real-time Tracking in a Status Update System with an Imperfect Feedback Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a status update system consisting of a finite-state Markov source, an energy-harvesting-enabled transmitter, and a sink. The forward and feedback channels between the transmitter and the sink are error-prone. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term time average of a (generic) distortion function subject to an energy causality constraint. Since the feedback channel is error-prone, the transmitter has only partial knowledge about the transmission results and, consequently, about the estimate of the source state at the sink. Therefore, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is then cast as a belief-MDP problem. The infinite belief space makes solving the belief-MDP difficult. Thus, by exploiting a specific property of the belief evolution, we truncate the state space and formulate a finite-state MDP problem, which is then solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA). Furthermore, we propose a low-complexity transmission policy in which the belief-MDP problem is transformed into a sequence of per-slot optimization problems. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed policies and their superiority compared to a baseline policy. Moreover, we numerically show that the proposed policies have switching-type structures.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Battery Degradation-Aware Scheduling for Distribution Network with Electric Vehicle Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries play a key role in today's power grid. In this paper, we investigate the impact of battery degradation on the distribution network. We formulate a multi-objective framework for optimizing battery scheduling with the goals of minimizing monetary costs and improving network performance. Our framework incorporates energy purchase and battery degradation into the costs and measures the network performance through energy losses and voltage deviation. We propose Bach for battery degradation-aware cheduling based on e-constraint and fuzzy logic methods. Bach is implemented for the IEEE 33-bus network for an experimental study. The results show the effectiveness of Bach in optimizing costs and performance simultaneously with battery degradation awareness and demonstrate the flexibility of further customization.</description>

      <title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbeds to validate the proposed method's effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discontinuous SFDIAs.</description>

      <title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their apparent benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. These vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise power system safety. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution systems. We derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attack impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we propose a method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the distribution system as a reactive defense approach. We study optimal defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game theory approach that is robust to LAAs. The proposed solution takes the potential errors in the attack localization into account. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the distribution network result in the highest detrimental impact on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Energy Storage Pricing for Social Welfare Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework to price energy storage in economic dispatch with a social welfare maximization objective. This framework can be utilized by power system operators to generate default bids for storage or to benchmark market power in bids submitted by storage participants. We derive a theoretical framework based on a two-stage chance-constrained formulation which systematically incorporates system balance constraints and uncertainty considerations. We present tractable reformulations for the joint chance constraints. Analytical results show that the storage opportunity cost is convex and increases with greater net load uncertainty. We also show that the storage opportunity prices are bounded and are linearly coupled with future energy and reserve prices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an ISO-NE test system and compare it with a price-taker storage profit-maximizing bidding model. Simulation results show that the proposed market design reduces electricity payments by an average of 17.4% and system costs by 3.9% while reducing storage's profit margins, and these reductions scale up with the renewable and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Learning Equilibrium with Estimated Payoffs in Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in population games, where agents select from multiple available strategies and continually revise their selections based on the payoffs associated with these strategies. Unlike conventional population game formulations, we consider a scenario where agents must estimate the payoffs through local measurements and communication with their neighbors. By employing task allocation games -- dynamic extensions of conventional population games -- we examine how errors in payoff estimation by individual agents affect the convergence of the strategy revision process. Our main contribution is an analysis of how estimation errors impact the convergence of the agents' strategy profile to equilibrium. Based on the analytical results, we propose a design for a time-varying strategy revision rate to guarantee convergence. Simulation studies illustrate how the proposed method for updating the revision rate facilitates convergence to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

      <title>Piecewise regression via mixed-integer programming for MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise regression is a versatile approach used in various disciplines to approximate complex functions from limited, potentially noisy data points. In control, piecewise regression is, e.g., used to approximate the optimal control law of model predictive control (MPC), the optimal value function, or unknown system dynamics. Neural networks are a common choice to solve the piecewise regression problem. However, due to their nonlinear structure, training is often based on gradient-based methods, which may fail to find a global optimum or even a solution that leads to a small approximation error. To overcome this problem and to find a global optimal solution, methods based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) can be used. However, the known MIP-based methods are either limited to a special class of functions, e.g., convex piecewise affine functions, or they lead to complex approximations in terms of the number of regions of the piecewise defined function. Both complicate a usage in the framework of control. We propose a new MIP-based method that is not restricted to a particular class of piecewise defined functions and leads to functions that are fast to evaluate and can be used within an optimization problem, making them well suited for use in control.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of Quadratic Constraints For Repeated ReLU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper derives a complete set of quadratic constraints (QCs) for the repeated ReLU. The complete set of QCs is described by a collection of $2^{n_v}$ matrix copositivity conditions where $n_v$ is the dimension of the repeated ReLU. We also show that only two functions satisfy all QCs in our complete set: the repeated ReLU and a repeated "flipped" ReLU. Thus our complete set of QCs bounds the repeated ReLU as tight as possible up to the sign invariance inherent in quadratic forms. We derive a similar complete set of incremental QCs for repeated ReLU, which can potentially lead to less conservative Lipschitz bounds for ReLU networks than the standard LipSDP approach. Finally, we illustrate the use of the complete set of QCs to assess stability and performance for recurrent neural networks with ReLU activation functions. The stability/performance condition combines Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with the QCs for repeated ReLU. A numerical implementation is given and demonstrated via a simple example.</description>

      <title>Safe and Reliable Training of Learning-Based Aerospace Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have generated highly successful controllers for a myriad of complex domains. However, the opaque nature of these models limits their applicability in aerospace systems and safety-critical domains, in which a single mistake can have dire consequences. In this paper, we present novel advancements in both the training and verification of DRL controllers, which can help ensure their safe behavior. We showcase a design-for-verification approach utilizing k-induction and demonstrate its use in verifying liveness properties. In addition, we also give a brief overview of neural Lyapunov Barrier certificates and summarize their capabilities on a case study. Finally, we describe several other novel reachability-based approaches which, despite failing to provide guarantees of interest, could be effective for verification of other DRL systems, and could be of further interest to the community.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function for Linearizable Systems with High Relative Degrees from Signal Temporal Logics: A Reference Governor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the safety-critical navigation problem with Signal Temporal Logic (STL) tasks. We developed an explicit reference governor-guided control barrier function (ERG-guided CBF) method that enables the application of first-order CBFs to high-order linearizable systems. This method significantly reduces the conservativeness of the existing CBF approaches for high-order systems. Furthermore, our framework provides safety-critical guarantees in the sense of obstacle avoidance by constructing the margin of safety and updating direction of safe evolution in the agent's state space. To improve control performance and enhance STL satisfaction, we employ efficient gradient-based methods for iteratively learning optimal parameters of ERG-guided CBF. We validate the algorithm through both high-order linear and nonlinear systems. A video demonstration can be found on: \url{https://youtu.be/ZRmsA2FeFR4}</description>

      <title>On Completeness of SDP-Based Barrier Certificate Synthesis over Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrier certificates, serving as differential invariants that witness system safety, play a crucial role in the verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Prevailing computational methods for synthesizing barrier certificates are based on semidefinite programming (SDP) by exploiting Putinar Positivstellensatz. Consequently, these approaches are limited by the Archimedean condition, which requires all variables to be bounded, i.e., systems are defined over bounded domains. For systems over unbounded domains, unfortunately, existing methods become incomplete and may fail to identify potential barrier certificates.
  In this paper, we address this limitation for the unbounded cases. We first give a complete characterization of polynomial barrier certificates by using homogenization, a recent technique in the optimization community to reduce an unbounded optimization problem to a bounded one. Furthermore, motivated by this formulation, we introduce the definition of homogenized systems and propose a complete characterization of a family of non-polynomial barrier certificates with more expressive power. Experimental results demonstrate that our two approaches are more effective while maintaining a comparable level of efficiency.</description>

      <title>Path Planning for a Cooperative Navigation Aid Vehicle to Assist Multiple Agents Sequentially</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers planning a path for a single underwater cooperative navigation aid (CNA) vehicle to sequentially aid a set of N agents to minimize average navigation uncertainty. Both the CNA and agents are modeled as constant-velocity vehicles. The agents travel along known nominal trajectories and the CNA plans a path to sequentially intercept them. Navigation aiding is modeled by a scalar discrete time Kalman filter. During path planning, the CNA considers surfacing to reduce its own navigation uncertainty. A greedy planning algorithm is proposed that uses a heuristic to schedule agents to the CNA that is based on the optimal time-to-aid, the overall navigation uncertainty reduction, and the transit time. The approach is compared to an optimal (exhaustive enumeration) algorithm through a Monte Carlo experiment with randomized agent trajectories and initial navigation uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Batch Estimation of a Steady, Uniform, Flow-Field from Ground Velocity and Heading Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents three batch estimation methods that use noisy ground velocity and heading measurements from a vehicle executing a circular orbit (or similar large heading change maneuver) to estimate the speed and direction of a steady, uniform, flow-field. The methods are based on a simple kinematic model of the vehicle's motion and use curve-fitting or nonlinear least-square optimization. A Monte Carlo simulation with randomized flow conditions is used to evaluate the batch estimation methods while varying the measurement noise of the data and the interval of unique heading traversed during the maneuver. The methods are also compared using experimental data obtained with a Bluefin-21 unmanned underwater vehicle performing a series of circular orbit maneuvers over a five hour period in a tide-driven flow.</description>

      <title>Modeling Fault Recovery and Transient Stability of Grid-Forming Converters Equipped With Current Reference Limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) face severe grid disturbances (e.g., short-circuit faults), the current limitation mechanism may be triggered. Consequently, the GFM IBRs enter the current-saturation mode, inducing nonlinear dynamical behaviors and posing great challenges to the post-disturbance transient angle stability. This paper presents a systematic study to reveal the fault recovery behaviors of a GFM IBR and identify the risk of instability. A closed-form expression for the necessary condition that a GFM IBR returns from the current-saturation mode to the normal operation mode is presented. Based on these analyses, it has been inferred that the angle of the magnitude-saturated current significantly affects the post-fault recovery and transient stability; with different angle selection, the system may follow multiple post-fault trajectories depending on those conditions: 1) Convergence to a normal stable equilibrium point (SEP), 2) convergence to a saturated stable equilibrium point (satSEP), or 3) divergence (instability). In this paper, the circumstances under which a GFM IBR cannot escape from the current-saturation mode are thoroughly investigated. The theoretical analyses are verified by dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, our algorithm directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply our algorithm to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian grey-box identification of nonlinear convection effects in heat transfer dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computational procedure for identifying convection in heat transfer dynamics. The procedure is based on a Gaussian process latent force model, consisting of a white-box component (i.e., known physics) for the conduction and linear convection effects and a Gaussian process that acts as a black-box component for the nonlinear convection effects. States are inferred through Bayesian smoothing and we obtain approximate posterior distributions for the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters using Laplace's method. The nonlinear convection function is recovered from the Gaussian process states using a Bayesian regression model. We validate the procedure by simulation error using the identified nonlinear convection function, on both data from a simulated system and measurements from a physical assembly.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Poroelastic Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework designed to model coupled-field problems specifically tailored for heterogeneous poroelastic media. Firstly, a composite neural network is developed where distinct neural networks are dedicated to predicting displacement and pressure variables for each material, employing identical activation functions but trained separately across all other parameters. Secondly, we handle the challenges of heterogeneous material interfaces by the Interface- PINNs (I-PINNs) framework, where different activation functions across any material interface are prescribed to ensure that the discontinuities in solution fields and gradients are accurately captured. We compare the modified PINNs framework with the conventional approach on two one-dimensional benchmark examples for poroelasticity in heterogeneous media. Furthermore, we assess a single neural network architecture, comparing it against the composite neural network proposed in this work. These examples show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior approximation accuracy in both displacements and pressures, and better convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Bucketized Active Sampling for Learning ACOPF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers optimization proxies for Optimal Power Flow (OPF), i.e., machine-learning models that approximate the input/output relationship of OPF. Recent work has focused on showing that such proxies can be of high fidelity. However, their training requires significant data, each instance necessitating the (offline) solving of an OPF. To meet the requirements of market-clearing applications, this paper proposes Bucketized Active Sampling (BAS), a novel active learning framework that aims at training the best possible OPF proxy within a time limit. BAS partitions the input domain into buckets and uses an acquisition function to determine where to sample next. By applying the same partitioning to the validation set, BAS leverages labeled validation samples in the selection of unlabeled samples. BAS also relies on an adaptive learning rate that increases and decreases over time. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of BAS.</description>

      <title>Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be used out of the box for transforming high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations of the world into rich occupancy representations. However, the reliability of these models and consequently their safe integration onto robots remains unknown when deployed in environments unseen during training. In this work, we address this challenge by rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of pre-trained perception systems for object detection via a novel calibration technique based on conformal prediction. Crucially, this procedure guarantees robustness to distribution shifts in states when perceptual outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. As a result, the calibrated perception system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in unseen environments. We evaluate the resulting approach, Perceive with Confidence (PwC), in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through previously unseen indoor, static environments. These experiments validate the safety assurances for obstacle avoidance provided by PwC and demonstrate up to $40\%$ improvements in empirical safety compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Reliable Projection Based Unsupervised Learning for Semi-Definite QCQP with Application of Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a special class of quadratic-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) with semi-definite constraints. Traditionally, since such a problem is non-convex and N-hard, the neural network (NN) is regarded as a promising method to obtain a high-performing solution. However, due to the inherent prediction error, it is challenging to ensure all solution output by the NN is feasible. Although some existing methods propose some naive methods, they only focus on reducing the constraint violation probability, where not all solutions are feasibly guaranteed. To deal with the above challenge, in this paper a computing efficient and reliable projection is proposed, where all solution output by the NN are ensured to be feasible. Moreover, unsupervised learning is used, so the NN can be trained effectively and efficiently without labels. Theoretically, the solution of the NN after projection is proven to be feasible, and we also prove the projection method can enhance the convergence performance and speed of the NN. To evaluate our proposed method, the quality of service (QoS)-contained beamforming scenario is studied, where the simulation results show the proposed method can achieve high-performance which is competitive with the lower bound.</description>
