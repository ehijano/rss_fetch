      <title>Mapping ammonia emission plumes using shortwave infrared imaging spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric ammonia emissions are harmful to ecosystems and human health. These emissions have traditionally been monitored using thermal infrared spectrometers, though such techniques are limited by thermal contrast requirements, the coarse spatial resolution of existing satellite sensors, and low measurement frequency of higher-resolution aerial surveys. Here, we show that ammonia emissions can be quantified using shortwave infrared imaging spectroscopy, circumventing these challenges by using reflected sunlight instead of thermal emission for signal and by enabling a large class of existing and future imaging spectrometers to enter the ammonia observing system. As a proof of concept for this newly discovered capability, we use Tanager-1 satellite data to quantify emissions from industrial point sources of ammonia in Pakistan and Uzbekistan.</description>

      <title>Winter forecasting of September/October rainfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate seasonal rainfall prediction as a reduced-order nonlinear forecasting problem, embedding coupled Indian-Pacific Ocean variability into a low-dimensional state space and projecting it forward using deep neural networks. Variables include Nino 3.4, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the Indian Ocean meridional SST gradient, and selected empirical orthogonal functions. Monthly time series of the variables then form the input into deep neural networks which project rainfall further into the future. Forecasts for the 2025 austral spring were generated and archived in the Mendeley database during the winter. Subsequent rainfall data demonstrated a high level of agreement with the forecasts, providing a validation of the method and supporting the hypothesis that chaotic yet conditionally predictable dynamics underpin spring rainfall variability in southeastern Australia.</description>

      <title>Selection of CMIP6 Models for Regional Precipitation Projection and Climate Change Assessment in the Jhelum and Chenab River Basins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective water resource management depends on accurate projections of flows in water channels. For projected climate data, use of different General Circulation Models (GCM) simulates contrasting results. This study shows selection of GCM for the latest generation CMIP6 for hydroclimate change impact studies. Envelope based method was used for the selection, which includes components based on machine learning techniques, allowing the selection of GCMs without the need for in-situ reference data. According to our knowledge, for the first time, such a comparison was performed for the CMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios data. In addition, the effect of climate change under SSP scenarios was studied, along with the calculation of extreme indices. Finally, GCMs were compared to quantify spatiotemporal differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 data. Results provide NorESM2 LM, FGOALS g3 as selected models for the Jhelum and Chenab River. Highly vulnerable regions under the effect of climate change were highlighted through spatial maps, which included parts of Punjab, Jammu, and Kashmir. Upon comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6, no discernible difference was found between the RCP and SSP scenarios precipitation projections. In the future, more detailed statistical comparisons could further reinforce the proposition.</description>
