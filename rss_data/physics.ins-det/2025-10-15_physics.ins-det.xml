      <title>The BUTTON-30 detector at Boulby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BUTTON-30 detector is a 30-tonne technology demonstrator designed to evaluate the potential of hybrid event detection, simultaneously exploiting both Cherenkov and scintillation light to detect particle produced in neutrino interactions. The detector is installed at a depth of 1.1 km in the Boulby Underground Laboratory allowing to test the performance of this new technology underground in a low background environment. This paper describes the design and construction of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of 3D pixel silicon sensors for the CMS Phase-2 Inner Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-luminosity upgrade of the CERN LHC requires the replacement of the CMS tracking detector to cope with the increased radiation fluence while maintaining its excellent performance. An extensive R\&amp;D program, aiming at using 3D pixel silicon sensors in the innermost barrel layer of the detector, has been carried out by CMS in collaboration with the FBK (Trento, Italy) and CNM (Barcelona, Spain) foundries. The sensors will feature a pixel cell size of \mbox{$25\times100~\mu m^2$}, with a centrally located electrode connected to the readout chip. The sensors are read out by the RD53A and CROCv1 chips, developed in 65~nm CMOS technology by the RD53 Collaboration, a joint effort between the ATLAS and CMS groups. This paper reports the results achieved in beam test experiments before and after irradiation, up to a fluence of approximately \mbox{\SI{2.6e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}}. Measurements of assemblies irradiated to a fluence of \mbox{\SI{1e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}} show a hit detection efficiency higher than 96\% at normal incidence, with fewer than 2\% of channels masked, across a bias voltage range greater than \SI{50}{V}. Even after irradiation to a higher fluence of \mbox{\SI{1.6e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}}, similar performance is maintained over a bias voltage range of \SI{30}{V}, remaining well within CMS requirements.</description>

      <title>New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Distributed network of smartphone sensors: a new tool for scientific field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We detail the time synchronisation protocol we implemented, based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the time synchronisation of 60 microseconds, more than enough for all mechanical applications. Eventually, we present two test cases in which we use a smartphone fleet for mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\phi=4\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\phi_{min}=5.1\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>
