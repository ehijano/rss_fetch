      <title>When AI Meets Finance (StockAgent): Large Language Model-based Stock Trading in Simulated Real-world Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can AI Agents simulate real-world trading environments to investigate the impact of external factors on stock trading activities (e.g., macroeconomics, policy changes, company fundamentals, and global events)? These factors, which frequently influence trading behaviors, are critical elements in the quest for maximizing investors' profits. Our work attempts to solve this problem through large language model based agents. We have developed a multi-agent AI system called StockAgent, driven by LLMs, designed to simulate investors' trading behaviors in response to the real stock market. The StockAgent allows users to evaluate the impact of different external factors on investor trading and to analyze trading behavior and profitability effects. Additionally, StockAgent avoids the test set leakage issue present in existing trading simulation systems based on AI Agents. Specifically, it prevents the model from leveraging prior knowledge it may have acquired related to the test data. We evaluate different LLMs under the framework of StockAgent in a stock trading environment that closely resembles real-world conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the impact of key external factors on stock market trading, including trading behavior and stock price fluctuation rules. This research explores the study of agents' free trading gaps in the context of no prior knowledge related to market data. The patterns identified through StockAgent simulations provide valuable insights for LLM-based investment advice and stock recommendation. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/Stockagent.</description>

      <title>Loss-Versus-Fair: Efficiency of Dutch Auctions on Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Milionis et al.(2023) studied the rate at which automated market makers leak value to arbitrageurs when block times are discrete and follow a Poisson process, and where the risky asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. We extend their model to analyze another popular mechanism in decentralized finance for onchain trading: Dutch auctions. We compute the expected losses that a seller incurs to arbitrageurs and expected time-to-fill for Dutch auctions as a function of starting price, volatility, decay rate, and average interblock time. We also extend the analysis to gradual Dutch auctions, a variation on Dutch auctions for selling tokens over time at a continuous rate. We use these models to explore the tradeoff between speed of execution and quality of execution, which could help inform practitioners in setting parameters for starting price and decay rate on Dutch auctions, or help platform designers determine performance parameters like block times.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Specifically, we illustrate how: 1) fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds; 2) performance fees can be charged like hedge funds; 3) mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes, such as high water marks; and 4) measures to offset trading related slippage costs when redemptions happen. Using our concepts - and blockchain technology - traditional funds can calculate performance fees in a simplified manner and alleviate several operational issues. Blockchain can solve many problems for traditional finance, while tried and tested wealth management techniques can benefit decentralization, speeding its adoption. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas and discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks, making smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to our mechanisms.</description>
