      <title>Circuit design in biology and machine learning. II. Anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a well-established field in machine learning, identifying observations that deviate from typical patterns. The principles of anomaly detection could enhance our understanding of how biological systems recognize and respond to atypical environmental inputs. However, this approach has received limited attention in analyses of cellular and physiological circuits. This study builds on machine learning techniques -- such as dimensionality reduction, boosted decision trees, and anomaly classification -- to develop a conceptual framework for biological circuits. One problem is that machine learning circuits tend to be unrealistically large for use by cellular and physiological systems. I therefore focus on minimal circuits inspired by machine learning concepts, reduced to cellular scale. Through illustrative models, I demonstrate that small circuits can provide useful classification of anomalies. The analysis also shows how principles from machine learning -- such as temporal and atemporal anomaly detection, multivariate signal integration, and hierarchical decision-making cascades -- can inform hypotheses about the design and evolution of cellular circuits. This interdisciplinary approach enhances our understanding of cellular circuits and highlights the universal nature of computational strategies across biological and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Analysis of Discrete Stochastic Population Models with Gamma Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stationary distributions of populations governed by the discrete stochastic logistic and Ricker difference equations at equilibrium examines with the gamma distribution. We identify mathematical relationships between the intrinsic growth rate in the stochastic equations and the parameters of the gamma distribution with a small stochastic perturbation. We present the biological significance of these relationships, emphasizing how the stochastic perturbation and shape parameter of the gamma distribution influence population dynamics at equilibrium. Furthermore, we identify two branches of the intrinsic growth rate, representing alternative stable states corresponding to higher and lower growth rates. This duality provides deeper insights into population stability and resilience under stochastic conditions.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the effect of macro control measures on epidemics transport via a coupled PDE crowd flow - epidemics spreading dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to provide an approach to the macroscopic modeling and simulation of pedestrian flow, coupled with contagion spreading, towards numerical investigation of the effect of certain, macro-control measures on epidemics transport dynamics. To model the dynamics of the pedestrians, a second-order macroscopic model, coupled with an Eikonal equation, is used. This model is coupled with a macroscopic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Susceptible-Vaccinated (SEISV) contagion model, where the force-of-infection $\beta$ coefficient is modeled via a drift-diffusion equation, which is affected by the air-flow dynamics due to the ventilation. The air-flow dynamics are obtained assuming a potential flow that can imitate the existence of ventilation in the computational domain. Numerical approximations are considered for the coupled model along with numerical tests and results. In particular, we investigate the effect of employment of different, epidemics transport control measures, which may be implemented through real-time manipulation of i) ventilation rate and direction, ii) maximum speed of pedestrians, and iii) average distances between pedestrians, and through iv) incorporation in the crowd of masked or vaccinated individuals. Such simulations of disease spreading in a moving crowd can potentially provide valuable information about the risks of infection in relevant situations and support the design of systematic intervention/control measures.</description>

      <title>Optimal switching strategies in multi-drug therapies for chronic diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to public health with millions of deaths linked to drug resistant infections every year. To mitigate resistance, common strategies that are used are combination therapies and therapy switching. However, the stochastic nature of pathogenic mutation makes the optimization of these strategies challenging. Here, we propose a two-scale stochastic model that considers the effective evolution of therapies in a multidimensional efficacy space, where each dimension represents the efficacy of a specific drug in the therapy. The diffusion of therapies within this space is subject to stochastic resets, representing therapy switches. The boundaries of the space, inferred from coarser pathogen-host dynamics, can be either reflecting or absorbing. Reflecting boundaries impede full recovery of the host, while absorbing boundaries represent the development of antimicrobial resistance, leading to therapy failure. We derive analytical expressions for the average absorption times, accounting for both continuous and discrete genomic changes using the frameworks of Langevin and Master equations, respectively. These expressions allow us to evaluate the relevance of times between drug-switches and the number of simultaneous drugs in relation to typical timescales for drug resistance development. We also explore realistic scenarios where therapy constraints are imposed to the number of administered therapies and/or their costs, finding non-trivial optimal drug-switching protocols that maximize the time before antimicrobial resistance develops while reducing therapy costs.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Survival Model for Stripe Formation in Zebrafish Exhibits Turing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zebrafish have been used as a model organism in many areas of biology, including the study of pattern formation. The mean-field survival model is a coupled ODE system describing the expected evolution of chromatophores coordinating to form stripes in zebrafish. This paper presents analysis of the model focusing on parameters for the number of cells, length of distant-neighbor interactions, and rates related to birth and death of chromatophores. We derive the conditions on these parameters for a Turing bifurcation to occur and show that the model predicts patterns qualitatively similar to those in nature.
  In addition to answering questions about this particular model, this paper also serves as a case study for Turing analysis on coupled ODE systems. The qualitative behavior of such coupled ODE models may deviate significantly from continuum limit models. The ability to analyze such systems directly avoids this concern and allows for a more accurate description of the behavior at physically relevant scales.</description>

      <title>Connections between sequential Bayesian inference and evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <title>Contrasting and comparing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical interventions on air-borne and vector-borne diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) aimed at limiting human mobility have demonstrated success in curbing the transmission of airborne diseases. However, their effectiveness in managing vector-borne diseases remains less clear. In this study, we introduce a framework that integrates mobility data with vulnerability matrices to evaluate the differential impacts of mobility-based NPIs on both airborne and vector-borne pathogens. Focusing on the city of Santiago de Cali in Colombia, our analysis illustrates how mobility-based policies previously proposed to contain airborne disease can make cities more prone to the spread of vector-borne diseases. By proposing a simplified synthetic model, we explain the limitations of the latter policies and exploit the synergies between both types of diseases to find new interventions reshaping the mobility network for their simultaneous control. Our results thus offer valuable insights into the epidemiological trade-offs of concurrent disease management, providing a foundation for the design and assessment of targeted interventions that reshape human mobility.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equlibrium inference of feeding rates through population data from generic consumer-resource stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical models are often structurally unidentifiable, because different set of parameters can lead to equal model outcomes. To be useful for prediction and parameter inference from data, stochastic population models need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be uniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In particular, precise estimation of feeding rates in consumer-resource dynamics is crucial, because consumer-resource processes are central in determining biomass transport across ecosystems. Model parameters are usually estimated at stationarity, because in that case model analyses are often easier. In this contribution we analyze the problem of parameter redundancy in a multi-resource consumer-resource model, showing that model indentifiability depends on whether the dynamics have reached stationarity or not. To be precise, we: (i) Calculate the steady-state and out-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances analytically using generating functions, which allow us to unveil parameter redundancy and carry out proper maximum likelihood estimation. (ii) Conduct in silico experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that are either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. (iii) Show that, when model observations are recorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas if sampling is done at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from data (i.e., parameters are redundant). We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of general dynamical models.</description>

      <title>Estimation of end-of-outbreak probabilities in the presence of delayed and incomplete case reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Towards the end of an infectious disease outbreak, when a period has elapsed without new case notifications, a key question for public health policy makers is whether the outbreak can be declared over. This requires the benefits of a declaration (e.g., relaxation of outbreak control measures) to be balanced against the risk of a resurgence in cases. To support this decision making, mathematical methods have been developed to quantify the end-of-outbreak probability. Here, we propose a new approach to this problem that accounts for a range of features of real-world outbreaks, specifically: (i) incomplete case ascertainment; (ii) reporting delays; (iii) individual heterogeneity in transmissibility; and (iv) whether cases were imported or infected locally. We showcase our approach using two case studies: Covid-19 in New Zealand in 2020, and Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018. In these examples, we found that the date when the estimated probability of no future infections reached 95% was relatively consistent across a range of modelling assumptions. This suggests that our modelling framework can generate robust quantitative estimates that can be used by policy advisors, alongside other sources of evidence, to inform end-of-outbreak declarations.</description>

      <title>A Swarm Coherence Mechanism for Jellyfish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of jellyfish swarm formation and exemplify it with simulations of active Brownian particles. The motivation for our analysis is the phenomenon of jellyfish blooms in the ocean and clustering of jellyfish in tank experiments. We argue that such clusters emerge due to an externally induced phase transition of jellyfish density, such as convergent flows, which is then maintained and amplified by self-induced stimuli. Our study introduces three mechanisms relevant for a better understanding of jellyfish blooming that have not been taken into account before which are a signaling tracer, jellyfish-wall interaction and ignorance of external stimuli. Our results agree with the biological fact that jellyfish exhibit an extreme sensitivity to stimuli in order to achieve favorable aggregations. Based on our theoretical framework, we are able to provide a clear terminology for future experimental analysis of jellyfish swarming and we pinpoint potential limitations of tank experiments.</description>
