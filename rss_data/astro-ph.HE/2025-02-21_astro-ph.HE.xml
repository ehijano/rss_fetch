      <title>The Effect of Vera C. Rubin Observatory Cadence Selections on Kilonova Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the optical/infra-red counterpart (AT2017gfo) to the binary neutron star gravitational-wave detection (GW170817), which was followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB170817), marked a groundbreaking moment in multi-messenger astronomy. To date, it remains the only confirmed joint detection of its kind. However, many experiments are actively searching for similar fast-fading electromagnetic counterparts, known as kilonovae. Fortunately, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) provides excellent prospects for identifying kilonova candidates either from, or independent of, gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst triggers. Cadence choices for LSST surveys are especially important for maximising the likelihood of kilonovae detections. In this work, we explore the possibility of optimizing Rubin Observatory's ability to detect kilonovae by implementing a fast transient metric shown to be successful with an existing wide field survey, e.g. the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We study existing LSST cadences, how detection rates are affected by filter selections, the return timescales for visits of the same area in the sky, and other relevant factors. Through our analysis, we have found that employing baseline cadences and utilizing triplet families like presto gap produced the highest likelihood of kilonova detection.</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral analysis of GK Persei during the 2010 dwarf nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GK Persei, an old nova and intermediate polar (IP), exhibited a dwarf nova (DN) outburst in 2010. This outburst was extensively observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, beginning 1.95 days after the eruption and continuing until 13.9 days before the maximum of the outburst in the optical. In this paper, we present timing and spectral analyses, comparing the results with those of other outbursts. We confirm the spin modulation in the 2 $-$ 10 keV X-ray range with a period of $P_{\rm WD} = 351.325(9)$ s. Additionally, we detected spin modulation in the 0.3 $-$ 2 keV band during the second half of the observations, a feature not seen in the 2015 and 2018 outbursts. This finding suggests that the soft X-ray emission in GK Per may originate partly near the magnetic poles and partly from a wind or circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Do Short GRBs Exhibit an Anticorrelation between Their Intrinsic Duration and Redshift?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are violent stellar explosions that are traditionally divided into two groups: short bursts (SGRBs) with an observed duration T90 &lt; 2 s, and long bursts (LGRBs) with an observed duration T90 &gt; 2 s, where T90 refers to the time needed for 90% of the fluence to be detected. Studies of progenitor models suggest that LGRBs emanate from the core collapse of massive stars, while SGRBs result from the merging of two compact objects, like two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Recent studies have found evidence that there is an anticorrelation between the intrinsic duration and the redshift of long GRBs. In this study, we first check whether LGRBs exhibit an anticorrelation between their intrinsic duration and redshift using an expanded dataset of long bursts that we have compiled. Next, we investigate whether this anticorrelation applies to SGRBs as well using a sample of short GRBs that we have compiled. Our analysis confirms the results obtained by previous studies regarding the anticorrelation for LGRBs. On the other hand, our results indicate that short GRBs do not exhibit such an anticorrelation. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of how metallicity evolves with redshift and the role that it might play in the aforementioned anticorrelation.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XVII: Discovery of beating radio emission variability in PSR J1514-4834</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the complex subpulse modulation patterns in PSR J1514-4834 (B1510-48) using L-band data from the Thousand-Pulsar-Array (TPA) programme, complemented with further MeerKAT UHF-band data. We demonstrate that periodic drifting subpulses and rapid amplitude modulation with a period of about 2 pulse periods coexist. It is established that these two periodic emission patterns interfere in the form of a beat system, giving rise to multiple spectral features. We develop a new methodology which confirms the expected correlations in the complex phase of the beat features in a 2D Fourier Transform of the data. Therefore, a relatively simple beat system can explain the complex single-pulse behaviour of this pulsar. The simultaneous coexistence of multiple subpulse modulation periodicities is rare in the population and points to poorly understood intricate dynamics within pulsar magnetospheres. A comparison with PSR B0943+10 is made, for which the coexistence of multiple periodicities has been argued to be a natural consequence of a rotating carousel. However, our observations of PSR J1514-4834 require a different explanation, involving time-delayed interactions between separate regions of the magnetosphere. The developed phase correlation methodology opens up the route for underlying beat systems in the modulation patterns of more pulsars.</description>

      <title>A possible overall scenario for the outburst evolution of MAXI J1820+070 revealed by Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral and temporal properties of the black hole X-ray transient binary MAXI J1820+070 during the 2018 outburst with Insight-HXMT observations. The outburst of MAXI J1820+070 can be divided into three intervals. For the two intervals of the outburst, we find that low-energy (below 140 keV) photos lag high-energy (140-170 keV) ones, while in the decay of the outburst, high-energy photons lag low-energy photons, both with a time scale of the order of days. Based on these results, the canonical hysteresis effect of the 'q' shape in the hardness-intensity diagram can be reformed into a roughly linear shape by taking into account the lag corrections between different energy bands. Time analysis shows that the high-frequency break of hard X-rays, derived from the power density spectrum of the first interval of the outburst is, in general, larger and more variable than that of soft X-rays. The spectral fitting shows that the coverage fraction of the hard X-rays drops sharply at the beginning of the outburst to around 0.5, then increases slightly. The coverage fraction drops to roughly zero once the source steps into a soft state and increases gradually to unity when the source returns to a low hard state. We discuss the possible overall evolution scenario of corona hinted from these discoveries.</description>

      <title>MOJAVE -- XXII. Brightness temperature distributions and geometric profiles along parsec-scale AGN jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial gradients of the brightness temperatures along the parsec-scale jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be used to infer the energy balance and to estimate the parameter range of physical conditions in these regions. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the brightness temperature gradients and geometry profiles of relativistic jets of 447 AGN based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array observations performed between 1994 and 2019. We used models of the jet structure using two-dimensional Gaussian components and analysed variations in their brightness temperatures and sizes along the jets. The size of the jet components, R, increases with projected distance from the jet base, r, as $R\propto r^{1.02\pm0.03}$, i.e., typically following a conically expanding streamline and therefore indicating that the size of jet components is a good tracer of jet geometry. The brightness temperature gradients along the jets typically follow a power-law $T_\mathrm{b} \propto r^{-2.82\pm0.07}$. Half of the sample sources show non-monotonic R(r) or Tb(r) profiles and their distributions were characterised by a double power-law model. We found at least six scenarios to explain the enhancement of the brightness temperature by a presence of inhomogeneities (shocks, jet recollimation) or curvature effects (helical structures, helical magnetic field, non-radial motion, bent jets). Our results are consistent with the scenario that the jet features can be simplified as optically thin moving blobs. In the sources demonstrating transition from a conical to parabolic jet shape, the gradient of the Tb(R) changes at the position of the break consistent with the model of magneto-hydrodynamic acceleration.</description>

      <title>How does Radiation Reaction Affect Relativistic Magnetized Shocks Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetized shocks, through the Synchrotron Maser Instability (SMI) mechanism, represent a promising framework for generating coherent radiations, potentially accounting for the enigmatic Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)-cosmic radio transients with extreme luminosity. This study investigates how the radiation reaction (RR) effect, induced by high-energy photon emissions during SMI, significantly modifies particle dynamics and emission properties in magnetized shocks. Through comprehensive Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that RR effects fundamentally alter coherent cyclotron motion at shock fronts, producing distinct observational signatures: spectral broadening, peak frequency upshift, and enhanced radiation intensity. Our findings suggest that RR-mediated magnetized shocks could provide a natural explanation for the bimodal energy distribution observed in repeating FRB 121102 and the positive correlation of luminosity-bandwidth between repeating and one-off FRBs in CHIME/FRB catalog. These results support the magnetized shock as a viable source of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomson Transport in High Opacity Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray radiation from neutron stars manifests itself in a variety of settings. Isolated pulsars, and magnetars both exhibit quasi-thermal persistent soft X-ray emission from their surfaces. Transient magnetospheric bursts from magnetars and pulsed signals from accreting neutron stars mostly appear in harder X rays. The emission zones pertinent to these signals are all highly Thomson optically thick so that their radiation anisotropy and polarization can be modeled using sophisticated simulations of scattering transport from extended emission regions. Validation of such codes and their efficient construction is enhanced by a deep understanding of scattering transport in high opacity domains. This paper presents a new analysis of the polarized magnetic Thomson radiative transfer in the asymptotic limit of high opacity. The integro-differential equations for photon scattering transport that result from a phase matrix construction are reduced to a compact pair of equations. This pair is then solved numerically for two key parameters that describe the photon anisotropy and polarization configuration of high Thomson opacity environs. Empirical approximations for these parameters as functions of the ratio of the photon and cyclotron frequencies are presented. Implementation of these semi-analytic transport solutions as interior boundary conditions is shown to speed up scattering simulations. The solutions also enable the specification of the anisotropic radiation pressure. The analysis is directly applicable to the atmospheres of magnetars and moderate-field pulsars, and to the accretion columns of magnetized X-ray binaries, and can be adapted to address other neutron star settings.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Multidimensional Models of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Progress and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consistent, multidimensional core-collapse supernova (SN) simulations, especially in 3D, have achieved tremendous progress over the past 10 years. They are now able to follow the entire evolution from core collapse through bounce, neutrino-triggered shock revival, shock breakout at the stellar surface to the electromagnetic SN outburst and the subsequent SN remnant phase. Thus they provide general support for the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism by reproducing observed SN energies, neutron-star (NS) kicks, and diagnostically relevant radioactive isotope yields; they allow to predict neutrino and gravitational-wave signals for many seconds of proto-NS cooling; they confirm correlations between explosion and progenitor or remnant properties already expected from previous spherically symmetric (1D) and 2D models; and they carve out various scenarios for stellar-mass black-hole (BH) formation. Despite these successes it is currently unclear which stars explode or form BHs, because different modeling approaches disagree and suggest the possible importance of the 3D nature of the progenitors and of magnetic fields. The role of neutrino flavor conversion in SN cores still needs to be better understood, the nuclear equation of state including potential phase transitions implies major uncertainties, the SN 1987A neutrino measurements raise new puzzles, and tracing a possible correlation of NS spins and kicks requires still more refined SN simulations.</description>

      <title>A new prescription for the spectral properties of population III stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated various emission properties of extremely low metallicity stellar populations in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), using the new GALSEVN model, which has shown promising agreement between spectral predictions and observations at lower redshifts and higher metallicities. We find that emission-line diagnostics previously proposed to discriminate between population III (Pop III) stars and other primordial ionizing sources are effective, but only for stellar-population ages below $\sim1$ Myr. We provide other key quantities relevant to modeling Pop III stellar populations in the EoR, such as the production efficiency of ionizing photons, which is critical for reionization studies, the production rate of Lyman-Werner photons, which can dissociate H$_2$ and influence the efficiency of star formation, and the rates of different types of supernov\ae, offering insights into the timescales of chemical enrichment in metal-poor environments. We complement our study with a self-consistent investigation of the gravitational-wave signals generated by the mergers of binary black holes that formed through stellar evolution and their detectability. The results presented here provide valuable predictions for the study of the EoR, on the crucial role of low-metallicity stellar populations in reionization mechanisms and star formation, as well as meaningful insights into potential observational counterparts to direct detections of Pop III stars.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>Localizing short-period pulsations in hard X-rays and Gamma-rays during an X9.0 flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feature of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) is frequently observed in the light curve of solar and stellar flares. In this letter, we investigated the QPP at a shorter period in high-energy channels of HXRs and Ggamma-ray continuum during an X9.0 flare on October 3, 2024 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08). The X9.0 flare was simultaneously measured by the Hard X-ray Imager, the Konus-Wind, and the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays. The shorter period center at about 1 s was determined by the fast Fourier transform with a Bayesianbased Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the wavelet analysis method. The restructured images show that the HXR sources are mainly separated into two fragments, regarding as double footpoints. Moreover, the footpoints move significantly during the flare QPP. Our results suggest that the intermittent and impulsive energy releases during the powerful flare are mainly caused by the interaction of hot plasma loops that are rooted in double footpoints. Thus, the flare QPP at a shorter period of about 1 s in HXR and Gamma-ray continuum emissions can be well explained by the interacting loop model.</description>

      <title>Dragging of inertial frames in the composed Kerr-Newman-orbiting-ring system</title>

Abstract: The dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting object implies that the horizon angular velocity $\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}$ of a central black hole in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is no longer related to its angular-momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ by the familiar vacuum functional relation $\Omega_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})=J_{\text{H}}/M\alpha$ (here $\{M,\alpha\}$ are respectively the mass and normalized area of the central spinning black hole). Using a continuity argument, it has recently been revealed that the composed Kerr-ring system is characterized by the universal (that is, spin-{\it independent}) relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}\equiv\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}},J_{\text{R}},R\to R^{+}_{\text{H}})-\Omega^{\text{Kerr}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$, where $\{R,J_{\text{R}}\}$ are respectively the radius of the ring and its orbital angular momentum and $R_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the central Kerr black hole. This intriguing observation naturally raises the following physically interesting question: Does the physical quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is always characterized by the near-horizon functional relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$ which is independent of the spin (angular momentum) $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central black hole? In the present compact paper we explore the physical phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting ring in the composed Kerr-Newman-black-hole-orbiting-ring system. In particular, using analytical techniques, we reveal the fact that in this composed two-body (black-hole-ring) system the quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ has an explicit non-trivial functional dependence on the angular momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Constraints on optical and near-infrared variability in the localisation of the long-period radio transient GLEAM-X J1627-52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GLEAM-X J1627-52 was discovered as a periodic (~18 min) radio signal over a duration of three months in 2018. It is an enigmatic example of a growing population of 'long-period radio transients' consistent with Galactic origins. Their nature is uncertain, and leading models invoke magnetic neutron stars or white dwarfs, potentially in close binary systems, to power them. GLEAM-X J1627-52 resides in the Galactic plane with a comparatively coarse localisation (~2 arcsecond). Here we study the localisation region to search for spectrophotometric signatures of a counterpart using time-domain searches in optical and near-infrared imaging, and MUSE integral field spectroscopy. No sources in the localisation display clear white dwarf spectral signatures, although at the expected distance we can only provide modest limits on their presence directly. We rule out the presence of hot sub-dwarfs in the vicinity. We found no candidate within our search for variability or periodic behaviour in the light curves. Radial velocity curves additionally show only weak evidence of variation, requiring any realistic underlying system to have very low orbital inclination (i &lt; 5 deg). Two Balmer emission line sources are reminiscent of white dwarf pulsar systems, but their characteristics fall within expected M-dwarf chromospheric activity with no signs of being in a close binary. Currently the white dwarf pulsar scenario is not supported, although longer baseline data and data contemporaneous with a radio active epoch are required before stronger statements. Isolated magnetars, or compact binaries remain viable. Our limits highlight the difficulty of these searches in dense environments at the limits of ground-based data.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Accretion in Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides an observational perspective on the fundamental properties of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes in quasars. It begins by outlining the selection criteria, particularly focusing on optical and UV broad-line intensity ratios, used to identify a population of unobscured super-Eddington candidates. Several defining features place these candidates at the extreme end of the Population A in main sequence of quasars: among them are the highest observed singly-ionized iron emission, extreme outflow velocities in UV resonance lines, and unusually high metal abundances. These key properties reflect the coexistence of a virialized sub-system within the broad-line region alongside powerful outflows, with the observed gas enrichment likely driven by nuclear or circumnuclear star formation. The most compelling evidence for the occurrence of super-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black holes comes from recent observations of massive black holes at early cosmic epochs. These black holes require rapid growth rates that are only achievable through radiatively inefficient super-Eddington accretion. Furthermore, extreme Eddington ratios, close to or slightly exceeding unity, are consistent with the saturation of radiative output per unit mass predicted by accretion disk theory for super-Eddington accretion rates. The extreme properties of super-Eddington candidates suggest that these quasars could make them stable and well-defined cosmological distance indicators, leveraging the correlation between broad-line width and luminosity expected in virialized systems. Finally, several analogies with accretion processes around stellar-mass black holes, particularly in the high/soft state, are explored to provide additional insight into the mechanisms driving super-Eddington accretion.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the influence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to a deconfined quark phase inside a neutron star on its cooling behaviour including the appearance of twin star solutions in the mass-radius diagram. We find that while the inferred neutrino luminosity of cold transiently-accreting star in MXB $1659\text{-}29$ is reproduced in all of the constructed twin star models, the luminosity of a colder source, the neutron star in SAX J$1808.4\text{-}3658$, cannot be described by equations of state with quark-hadron transition densities below $1.7$ saturation density, suggesting that twin stars with such low density transitions to the quark phase are not realized in nature. We also discuss how constraints to the quark-hadron phase transition density are strongly dependent on the cooling effectiveness of neutrino reactions in the quark phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations of self-consistent, rotating neutron stars with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. Specifically, we investigate the role of resistivity in the dynamical evolution of neutron stars over a period of up to 100 ms and its effects on their quasi-equilibrium configurations. Our results demonstrate that resistivity can significantly influence the development of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in markedly different magnetic field geometries. Additionally, resistivity suppresses the growth of these instabilities, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of emitted gravitational waves. Despite the variations in magnetic field geometries, the ratio of poloidal to toroidal field energies remains consistently 9:1 throughout the simulations, for the models we investigated.</description>

      <title>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches $\sim200$~EeV known as Amaterasu CR. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of $\sim1$~ZeV ion within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of $\sim$~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim10$~PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long 2D general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized white dwarfs (WDs), which might originate as remnants of double-WD mergers. This study examines extreme combinations of magnetic fields and rotation rates, motivated both by the need to address the limitations of 2D axisymmetric simulations and to explore the physics of AIC under rare conditions that, while yet to be observationally confirmed, may be consistent with current theoretical models and account for unusual events. Under these assumptions, our results demonstrate that, if realizable, such systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230307A. These findings highlight the potential role of AIC in heavy $r$-process element production and offer a framework for understanding rare LGRBs associated with kilonova emission. Longer-duration 3D simulations are needed to fully capture magnetic field amplification, resolve instabilities, and determine the fate of the energy retained by the magnetar at the end of the simulations.</description>

      <title>LEIA discovery of the longest-lasting and most energetic stellar X-ray flare ever detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) detected a new X-ray transient on 2022 November 7, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby K-type giant star HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double fast rise and exponential decay model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 * 10^12 cm. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted by a four-temperature apec model (with three components being the quiescent background), showing significant evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting that this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic and rotation axis alignment in driving fast radio burst phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can describe a broad range of FRB phenomenology, from non-repeating bursts to highly prolific repeaters. Coherent radio waves in these bursts are produced in the polar cap region of a magnetar, where magnetic field lines are open. The angle between the rotation and magnetic axes, relative to the angular size of the polar cap region, partially determines the repetition rate and polarization properties of FRBs. We discuss how many of the properties of repeating FRBs-such as their lack of periodicity, energetics, small PA swing, spectro-temporal correlation and inferred low source density are explained by this scenario. The systematic PA swing and the periodic modulation of long duration bursts from non-repeaters are also natural outcomes. We derive a lower limit of about 400 on the Lorentz factor of FRB sources applying this scenario to bursts with a linear polarization degree greater than 95\%.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower-energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training data set of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.</description>

      <title>Fast dynamic ejecta in neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ejection of neutron-rich matter is one of the most important consequences of a neutron star merger. While the bulk of the matter is ejected at fast, but non-relativistic velocities ($\sim0.2c$), a small amount of mildly relativistic dynamic ejecta have been seen in a number of numerical simulations. Such ejecta can have far reaching observational consequences ranging from the shock breakout burst of gamma-rays promptly after the merger, to an early ($\sim 1$ hour post-merger) blue kilonova precursor signal, to synchrotron emission years after the merger ("kilonova afterglow"). These all potentially carry the imprint of the binary system parameters and the equation of state. By analyzing Lagrangian simulations in full General Relativity, performed with the code SPHINCS_BSSN, we identify two ejection mechanisms for fast ejecta: i) about 30\% of the ejecta with {$v&gt; 0.4c$} are "sprayed out" from the shear interface between the merging stars and escape along the orbital plane and ii) the remaining $\sim$ 70\% of the fast ejecta result from the central object "bouncing back" after strong, general-relativistic compression. This "bounce component" is ejected in a rather isotropic way and reaches larger velocities (by $\sim0.1c$) so that its faster parts can catch up with and shock slower parts of the spray ejecta. Even for a case that promptly collapses to a black hole, we find fast ejecta with similar properties to the non-collapsing case, while slower matter parts are swallowed by the forming black hole. We discuss observational implications of these fast ejecta, including shock breakout and kilonova afterglow.</description>

      <title>The footprint of nuclear saturation properties on the neutron star $f$ mode oscillation frequencies: a machine learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intricate relationships between the non-radial \(f\) mode oscillation frequencies of neutron stars (NS)s and the corresponding nuclear matter equation of state (EOS) using a machine learning (ML) approach within the ambit of the relativistic mean field (RMF) framework for nuclear matter. With two distinct parameterizations of the Walecka model, namely, (1) with non-linear self interactions of the scalar field (NL) and, (2) a density dependent Bayesian model (DDB), we perform a thorough examination of the \(f\) mode frequency in relation to various nuclear saturation properties. The correlations between the \(f\) mode frequencies and nuclear saturation properties reveal, through various analytical and ML methods, the complex nature of NSs and their potential as the cosmic laboratory for studying extreme states of matter. A principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed using mixed datasets from DDB and NL models to discriminate the relative importance of the different components of the EOS on the $f$ mode frequencies. Additionally, a {\it Random forest feature importance} analysis also elucidates the distinct roles of these properties in determining the \(f\) mode frequency across a spectrum of NS masses. Our findings are further supported by symbolic regression searches, yielding high-accuracy relations with strong Pearson coefficients and minimal errors. These relations suggest new methodologies for probing NS core characteristics, such as energy density, pressure, and speed of sound from observations of non-radial \(f\) mode oscillations of NSs.</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hawking evaporation of black holes formed by dark matter in compact stars</title>

Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02925</link>

Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Oscillations of Massive Boson Stars and Distinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive Boson Stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields. The equation of state of massive boson stars and their masses, radii, modeled by a self-interacting scalar field with potential of the form $V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m^2|\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4}\lambda |\phi|^4$ are known to follow scaling relations. The non-radial fundamental oscillations of such massive BSs have been studied only for a few select model parameters so far. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that the $f$-mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit ($\lambda \gg m^2/M_{Pl}^2$). This opens up the outstanding prospect of studying the $f$-modes of massive BSs throughout the scalar DM parameter space. We study the implications of this finding by carrying out a detailed study of massive BS $f$-modes in a separate work. Here, having introduced this scaling, we use it to compare boson star oscillations with the neutron star and black hole quasinormal modes, thus providing a smoking gun for the distinguishability of BSs using gravitational waves.</description>
