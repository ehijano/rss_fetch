      <title>Ranking protein-protein models with large language models and graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are associated with various diseases, including cancer, infections, and neurodegenerative disorders. Obtaining three-dimensional structural information on these PPIs serves as a foundation to interfere with those or to guide drug design. Various strategies can be followed to model those complexes, all typically resulting in a large number of models. A challenging step in this process is the identification of good models (near-native PPI conformations) from the large pool of generated models. To address this challenge, we previously developed DeepRank-GNN-esm, a graph-based deep learning algorithm for ranking modelled PPI structures harnessing the power of protein language models. Here, we detail the use of our software with examples. DeepRank-GNN-esm is freely available at https://github.com/haddocking/DeepRank-GNN-esm</description>

      <title>Assessment of scoring functions for computational models of protein-protein interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A goal of computational studies of protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) is to predict the binding site between two monomers that form a heterodimer. The simplest version of this problem is to rigidly re-dock the bound forms of the monomers, which involves generating computational models of the heterodimer and then scoring them to determine the most native-like models. Scoring functions have been assessed previously using rank- and classification-based metrics, however, these methods are sensitive to the number and quality of models in the scoring function training set. We assess the accuracy of seven PPI scoring functions by comparing their scores to a measure of structural similarity to the x-ray crystal structure (i.e. the DockQ score) for a non-redundant set of heterodimers from the Protein Data Bank. For each heterodimer, we generate re-docked models uniformly sampled over DockQ and calculate the Spearman correlation between the PPI scores and DockQ. For some targets, the scores and DockQ are highly correlated; however, for many targets, there are weak correlations. Several physical features can explain the difference between difficult- and easy-to-score targets. For example, strong correlations exist between the score and DockQ for targets with highly intertwined monomers and many interface contacts. We also develop a new score based on only three physical features that matches or exceeds the performance of current PPI scoring functions. These results emphasize that PPI prediction can be improved by focusing on correlations between the PPI score and DockQ and incorporating more discriminating physical features into PPI scoring functions.</description>

      <title>The need to implement FAIR principles in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter illustrates the opinion of the molecular dynamics (MD) community on the need to adopt a new FAIR paradigm for the use of molecular simulations. It highlights the necessity of a collaborative effort to create, establish, and sustain a database that allows findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of molecular dynamics simulation data. Such a development would democratize the field and significantly improve the impact of MD simulations on life science research. This will transform our working paradigm, pushing the field to a new frontier. We invite you to support our initiative at the MDDB community (https://mddbr.eu/community/)</description>

      <title>EquiPocket: an E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Graph Neural Network for Ligand Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the binding sites of target proteins plays a fundamental role in drug discovery. Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of protein size shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket, an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction, which comprises three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure of protein and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output layer to alleviate the effect incurred by variable protein size. Extensive experiments on several representative benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>T cell receptor binding prediction: A machine learning revolution</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in immune sequencing and experimental techniques are generating extensive T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, enabling the development of models to predict TCR binding specificity. Despite the computational challenges due to the vast diversity of TCRs and epitopes, significant progress has been made. This paper discusses the evolution of the computational models developed for this task, with a focus on machine learning efforts, including the early unsupervised clustering approaches, supervised models, and the more recent applications of Protein Language Models (PLMs). We critically assess the most prominent models in each category, and discuss recurrent challenges, such as the lack of generalization to new epitopes, dataset biases, and biases in the validation design of the models.
  Furthermore, our paper discusses the transformative role of transformer-based protein models in bioinformatics. These models, pretrained on extensive collections of unlabeled protein sequences, can convert amino acid sequences into vectorized embeddings that capture important biological properties. We discuss recent attempts to leverage PLMs to deliver very competitive performances in TCR-related tasks. Finally, we address the pressing need for improved interpretability in these often opaque models, proposing strategies to amplify their impact in the field.</description>
