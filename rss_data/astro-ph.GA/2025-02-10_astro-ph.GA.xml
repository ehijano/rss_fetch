      <title>1000-10,000 M$_\odot$ Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in the Galaxy GS 3073 at $z = 5.55$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the accuracy of observable distributions for galaxies classified in the Projected Phase Space Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of galaxy populations classified according to their kinematic behaviours and dynamical state using the Projected Phase Space Diagram (PPSD) are affected by misclassification and contamination, leading to systematic errors in determining the characteristics of the different galaxy classes. We propose a method to statistically correct the determination of galaxy properties' distributions accounting for the contamination caused by misclassified galaxies from other classes. Using a sample of massive clusters and galaxies in their surroundings taken from the MultiDark Planck 2 simulation combined with the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG, we compute the confusion matrix associated to a classification scheme in the PPSD. Based on positions in the PPSD, galaxies are classified as cluster members, backsplash galaxies, recent infallers, infalling galaxies, and interlopers. This classification is determined using probabilities calculated by the code ROGER, along with a threshold criterion. By inverting the confusion matrix, we are able to get better determinations of distributions of galaxy properties such as colour. Compared to a direct estimation based solely on the predicted galaxy classes, our method provides better estimates of the mass-dependent colour distribution for the galaxy classes most affected by misclassification: cluster members, backsplash galaxies, and recent infallers. We apply the method to a sample of observed X-ray clusters and galaxies. Our method can be applied to any classification of galaxies in the PPSD, and to any other galaxy property besides colour, provided an estimation of the confusion matrix. Blue, low-mass galaxies in clusters are almost exclusively recent infaller galaxies that have not yet been quenched by the environmental action of the cluster. Backsplash galaxies are on average redder than expected.</description>

      <title>Cloud-scale gas properties, depletion times, and star formation efficiency per free-fall time in PHANGS--ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare measurements of star formation efficiency to cloud-scale gas properties across PHANGS-ALMA. Dividing 67 galaxies into 1.5 kpc scale regions, we calculate the molecular gas depletion time, tau_dep= Sigma_mol/Sigma_SFR, and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, eff=tau_ff/tau_dep, for each region. Then we test how tau_dep and eff vary as functions of the regional mass-weighted mean molecular gas properties on cloud scales (60-150pc): gas surface density, &lt;Sigma_mol^cloud&gt;, velocity dispersion, &lt;sigma_mol^cloud&gt;, virial parameter, &lt;alpha_vir^cloud&gt;, and gravitational free-fall time, &lt;tau_ff^cloud&gt;. &lt;tau_ff^cloud&gt; and tau_dep correlate positively, consistent with the expectation that gas density plays a key role in setting the rate of star formation. Our fiducial measurements suggest tau_dep \propto &lt;tau_ff^cloud&gt;^0.5 and eff \approx 0.34%, though the exact numbers depend on the adopted fitting methods. We also observe anti-correlations between tau_dep and &lt;Sigma_mol^cloud&gt; and between tau_dep^mol and &lt;sigma_mol^cloud&gt; . All three correlations may reflect the same underlying link between density and star formation efficiency combined with systematic variations in the degree to which self-gravity binds molecular gas in galaxies. We highlight the tau_dep-&lt;sigma_mol^cloud&gt; relation because of the lower degree of correlation between the axes. Contrary to theoretical expectations, we observe an anti-correlation between tau_dep^mol and &lt;alpha_vir^cloud&gt; and no significant correlation between eff and &lt;alpha_vir^cloud&gt;. Our results depend sensitively on the adopted CO-to-H2 conversion factor, with corrections for excitation and emissivity effects in inner galaxies playing an important role. We emphasize that our simple methodology and clean selection allow easy comparison to numerical simulations and highlight this as a logical next direction.</description>

      <title>Starburst Galaxies in Their Last Billion Years: An H${\delta}$ Absorption Line Selected Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the study of starburst galaxies in their final billion years. Our galaxy selection is based solely on the presence of the H${\delta}$ absorption line, which permits tracing the later evolution of starburst galaxies, coinciding with the emergence of A-type stars in these galaxies. We propose a novel method that utilizes star formation rate and UVJ colors to classify galaxies in the sample, and use the spectral features to mark their evolution stages. Our in-depth analysis of the MgII line indicates the substantial increasing of F- and G-type stars when a galaxy evolves from star forming to quiescent phase. Furthermore, we identify AGNs in this sample to explore their roles in the later stage of galaxy star formation history.</description>

      <title>The Gas-to-Dust Ratio Investigation in the Massive Star-Forming region M17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M17 is a well-known massive star-forming region, and its Gas-to-Dust Ratio (GDR) may vary significantly compared to the other areas. The mass of gas can be traced by the ${\rm CO}$ emission observed in the \emph{Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project}. The dust mass can be traced by analyzing the interstellar extinction magnitude obtained from the \emph{United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)}. We computed the ratio ${W({\rm CO})/A_V}$: for ${A_V \le }$ 10 mag, ${{ W(^{12}{\rm CO})/ A_V}= (6.27 \pm 0.19)}$ ${\mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$ and ${{ W(^{13}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (0.75 \pm 0.72)}$ ${ \mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$; whereas for ${{A_V} \ge 10}$ mag, ${{ W(^{12}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (15.8 \pm 0.06) }$ ${\mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$ and ${{ W(^{13}{\rm CO})/ A_V} = (3.11 \pm 0.25)}$ ${ \mathrm{{K \cdot km/s} \cdot mag^{-1}}}$. Then, we converted the ${W({\rm CO})/A_V}$ into ${N(\rm H)/A_V}$. Using the WD01 model, we derived the GDR: for ${A_V \le }$ 10 mag, the GDRs were ${118 \pm 9}$ for ${^{12}{\rm CO}}$ and ${83 \pm 62}$ for ${^{13}{\rm CO}}$, comparable to those of the Milky Way; however, for ${A_V \ge }$ 10 mag, the GDRs increased significantly to ${296 \pm 3}$ for ${^{12}{\rm CO}}$ and ${387 \pm 40}$ for ${^{13}{\rm CO}}$, approximately three times higher than those of the Milky Way. In the discussion, we compared the results of this work with previous studies and provided a detailed discussion of the influence of massive stars and other factors on GDR.</description>

      <title>Core to Cosmic Edge: SIMBA-C's New Take on Abundance Profiles in the Intragroup Medium at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>

      <title>Explaining JWST counts with galaxy formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinct power-law break is apparent m_AB approximately 21 in the deep Near-Infrared PEARLS-JWST galaxy counts. The break becomes more pronounced at longer wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent magnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an increasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam, 4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the origin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for the break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change in the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the k-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type galaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the luminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the galaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of approximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is mainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z &lt; 2) for the PEARLS observational limit of m_AB &lt; 28. We give a comprehensive description of why the galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the way they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent magnitude.</description>

      <title>Potential Nitrogen Enrichment via Direct-Collapse Wolf-Rayet Stars in a $z=4.7$ Star-Forming Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analyses of a nitrogen-enriched star-forming galaxy, ID60001, at $z=4.6928$ based on JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectroscopy and NIRCam photometry. From rest-frame optical emission lines we derive the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio of ID60001 to be $\log({\rm N/O})=-0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ ($[{\rm N/O}]=0.10_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$), which is significantly elevated at the corresponding metallicity $12+\log({\rm O/H})=7.75_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ ($Z/Z_\odot = 0.12$) compared to local counterparts. We discuss possible scenarios for elevated N/O abundance in ID60001, including pristine gas inflow, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, and Oxygen depletion by Type II supernova winds. Based on the moderately broadened He{\sc ii}$\lambda$4686 emission line, galaxy morphology, and star-formation history, we conclude that the elevated N/O abundance of ID60001 is likely originated from massive ($&gt;25\,M_\odot$) WR stars that directly collapse into a black hole. We also stress the importance of reliable electron density measurements when deriving N/O abundance with rest-frame optical emission lines.</description>

      <title>Puzzling Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy Evolution (PUDGE). I. The existence of a Nube-like galaxy in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the most extended ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG), Nube, has raised yet another question about the validity of the cold dark matter (CDM) model. The studies using cosmological and zoom-in simulations, which assume CDM, failed to replicate galaxies with the structural properties of Nube. However, the simulation box or the examined population of UDGs may be too narrow to fully capture the range of effects that can lead to the formation of such extraordinary galaxies. In this work we present a case study of a Nube-like galaxy from TNG100, the most extended simulated UDG examined to date that closely mirrors the structural properties of the observed Nube galaxy. Since its formation, the simulated Nube-like galaxy has already been ultra-diffuse and evolved mainly in isolated regions with occasional interactions. Its last major merger was finalized about 1.336 Gyr ago and left no trace of interaction apart from further extending the stellar size. This evolutionary pathway, featuring a recent merger that expanded an already ultra-diffuse stellar system, is unique and innovative compared to previous studies. We argue that multiple proposed formation mechanisms can operate simultaneously, further expanding the UDGs and making them extreme outliers of the mass-size relation under favorable conditions. Therefore, it is essential to study these simulated extreme outliers, their formation, and, more importantly, their evolution. We also highlight the necessity of carefully analyzing and interpreting the simulated data and better understanding the limitations of a chosen simulation. Thus, if Nube is considered an extreme outlier, its properties are not in tension with the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Scattered synchrotron emission and a giant torus revealed in polarized light in the nearest radio galaxy Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centaurus A (Cen A) is the closest radio galaxy and a prime example of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), exhibiting complex emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. The nature of its continuum emission, particularly the mechanisms powering it, has been a subject of considerable debate due to the fact that the AGN is deeply buried in dust. This study aims to elucidate the origin of the continuum emission in Cen A and determine the geometrical arrangement of matter in the nuclear region by the mean of optical and near-infrared spectropolarimetry. We obtained spectropolarimetric data of Cen A using the VLT/FORS2. The analysis revealed a region showing strong and narrow emission lines associated with AGN activity. After correction for interstellar polarization in the dust lane (but not for starlight), the intrinsic polarization of the scattered AGN light exhibits a polarization degree of 2-4%, decreasing from optical to near-infrared, associated with a polarization position angle perpendicular to the radio jet axis. We exclude the presence of hidden broad line in our polarized flux spectrum at more than 99% probability. Narrow emission lines are found to be strongly polarized and orthogonal to the jet position angle. We demonstrate that a beamed synchrotron jet, scattering onto the narrow line region (NLR) best fits all the observational properties reported in this paper and the literature. In this model, the base of the NLR is obscured by a giant circumnuclear region and can only become visible through perpendicular scattering onto the outermost part of the NLR, naturally producing high polarization degrees and polarization angles perpendicular to the radio structure. This study provides strong evidence that Cen A defines a new class of hidden-NLR AGNs and supports old predictions that beamed synchrotron jets can be observed in reflection.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the co-evolution between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies provides crucial insights into SMBH formation and galaxy assembly in these cosmic ecosystems. However, measuring this co-evolution, as traced by the black hole mass - stellar mass relation towards the early Universe, often suffers from significant sample selection biases. Samples selected based on the luminosity of the SMBH would preferentially find overly massive black holes relative to their host stellar mass, missing the population of lower-mass SMBHs that are underrepresented. Here we report the discovery of 13 moderate-luminosity broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei from a galaxy-based selection of 52 massive galaxies at z~3-5. The derived SMBH masses for these AGNs yield a mean SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~0.1%, consistent with the local value. There is limited evolution in this mean mass ratio traced back to z~6, indicating that a significant population of ''normal'' SMBHs already existed within the first billion years of the Universe. Combined with the previous sample of overmassive black holes, there must be diverse pathways for SMBH formation in high-redshift galaxies. Most of these galaxies are experiencing star formation quenching by the observed epoch, suggesting the formation of massive quiescent galaxies does not necessarily require an overly massive black hole, contrary to some theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations and tidal disruption in spin $s$ ultralight dark matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting halos after they merge and relax in a steady-state. Our findings reveal that higher spin values lead to broader, less dense final halo with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of initial solitons involved. We identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core and NFW tail of spin $s$ ULDM halos as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{sol}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent halos based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{sol}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of a ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host halos having the same average density, the orbital decay time of the satellite is as predicted for uniform sphere host halo regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, while satellites orbiting haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.</description>

      <title>The Blue supergiant problem and the main-sequence width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Gaia DR3 we derive new distances and luminosities for a sample of Galactic B supergiants which were thought to be post main-sequence (MS) objects from their HR diagram location beyond the terminal-age MS (TAMS). When applying the newer Gaia distances in addition to enhanced amounts of core-boundary mixing, aka convective overshooting, we show that these Galactic B supergiants are likely enclosed within the MS band, indicating an evolutionary stage of steady core hydrogen burning. We discuss the importance of considering enhanced overshooting and how vectors in the mass-luminosity plane (ML-plane) can be used to disentangle the effects of wind mass loss from interior mixing. We finish with the key message that any proposed solution to the BSG problem should consider not only an explanation for the sheer number of B supergiants inside the Hertzsprung gap, but should at the same time also account for the steep drop in rotation rates identified at spectral type B1 -- corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim$21 kK, and for which two distinct families of solutions have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Observations of Holographic Quantum-Foam Blurring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "foamy" nature of spacetime at the Planck scale was an idea first introduced by John Wheeler in the 1950s. And for the last twenty years or so it has been debated whether those inherent uncertainties in time and path-length might also accumulate in transiting electromagnetic wavefronts, resulting in measurable blurring for images of distant galaxies and quasars. A confusing aspect is that "pointlike" objects will always be blurred out somewhat by the optics of a telescope, especially in the optical. But it turns out that Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are more useful to test this, and have been observed by a host of ground-based and space-based telescopes, including by the Fermi observatory for well over a decade. And a recent one was unprecedented: GRB221009A was extremely bright, allowing follow-up from the infrared through the ultraviolet to X-rays and gamma-rays, including a first association with photons at high TeV energies. I will discuss how that observation is in direct tension with the calculus of how spacetime "foaminess" can add up in an image of a pointsource at cosmological distances, which at high-enough energy could spread these out over the whole sky without resulting in photon loss. A simple multiwavelength average of foam-induced blurring consistent with holographic quantum gravity is described, analogous to atmospheric seeing from the ground. This fits with measured instrumental point-spread functions and with the highest-energy localization of GRB221009A, resolving the observational issues and pointing to a key physical implication: spacetime does not look smooth.</description>

      <title>The XXL Survey LIV. X-ray Luminosity Function and Luminosity-Mass Relation of Optically Selected Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overlap between the GAMA spectroscopic survey and the XXL X-ray survey was used to study the X-ray properties of optically-selected groups of galaxies. Forced X-ray aperture photometry was applied to an optically-selected sample of 235 groups (containing at least five member galaxies) to measure their X-ray luminosities in the regime of low signal to noise X-ray data. The sample encompasses X-ray luminosities over an order of magnitude fainter than typical X-ray selected samples, and avoids X-ray selection biases. This gives access to low mass groups where the effects of non-gravitational processes, such as AGN-feedback, should be most apparent and could inhibit their detection in an X-ray survey. We measured the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the sample, and found it to be consistent with the extrapolation of the XLF from X-ray selected samples at higher luminosities. The XLF was combined with a theoretical halo mass function to infer the form of the scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and mass (LM relation) for the GAMA groups. We found a slope of $1.87 \pm 0.12$, which is steeper than self similarity in this mass regime. When comparing with other measurements of the LM relation, we find evidence for a steepening of the slope in the low mass regime, likely due to the impact of non-gravitational processes. Our approach can be translated to eROSITA data using multi-wavelength surveys to constrain the X-ray properties of galaxy groups in the limits of high redshift and low mass.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Galactic Halo Reconstruction from Rotation Curves in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy Dark Matter with an explicitly non-zero quartic self-interaction (gFDM) is shown to be a viable model for simultaneously fitting 17 dark-matter-dominated galaxies from the SPARC database, constraining both the boson mass, $m$, and the self-coupling constant, $g$, to values within the range $\log_{10}\left(\frac{m}{\mathrm{eV}/c^2}\right) = \log_{10}(1.98)-22^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$ and $\log_{10}\left(\frac{g}{\mathrm{Jm}^3/kg}\right) = \log_{10}(1.45)-28^{+0.4}_{-1.2}$; this is based on the combination of an appropriately constructed static super-Gaussian profile for the inner galactic core (`soliton') region, and a Navarro-Frenk-White profile for the surrounding halo region. Identification of these parameters enables the explicit {\em dynamical} reconstruction of potential host halos for such galaxies, for which we outline a procedure with a proof-of-principle demonstration for two galaxies (UGCA444, UGC07866) shown to yield viable rotation curves over a dynamical period of $O(1) \, Gyr$.</description>

      <title>The head-tail radio galaxy and revived fossil plasma in Abell 1775</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Head-tail radio galaxies are characterized by a head, corresponding to an elliptical galaxy, and two radio jets sweeping back from the head, forming an extended structure behind the host galaxy that is moving through the intracluster medium (ICM). This morphology arises from the interaction between the diffuse radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding environment. Sometimes revived fossil plasma is found in galaxy clusters, tracing old active galactic nucleus ejecta with a very steep spectrum re-energized through processes in the ICM, unrelated to the progenitor galaxy. We aim to study the central region of Abell 1775, a galaxy cluster in an unclear dynamical state at z = 0.072. It hosts two giant radio-loud elliptical galaxies, the head-tail radio galaxy that "breaks" at the position of a cold front detected in the X-rays, filamentary revived fossil plasma, and central diffuse emission. This study aims to investigate and constrain the spectral properties and trends along the head-tail, as well as the revived fossil plasma, to better understand the formation process of the non-thermal phenomena in A1775. We make use of LOFAR (144 MHz), and new deep uGMRT observations (400 and 650 MHz). We observe an overall steepening along the tail of the head-tail radio galaxy. In the radio colour-colour diagram, ageing models reproduce the emission of the head-tail. An unexpected brightness increase at the head of the tail suggests a complex bending of the jets. We derived the equipartition magnetic field and minimum pressure along the tail. We recovered the structure of the revived fossil plasma, which appears as thin filaments with ultra-steep spectra. We show that high-sensitivity, high-resolution observations at low frequencies are essential for detecting the full extent of the tail, enabling a deeper spectral analysis and resolving the structure and spectral properties of revived fossil plasma.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals thermal and non-thermal desorption of methanol ice in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from 14.6$^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Emission from multiple molecular isotopologues in a high-inclination protoplanetary disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a MIRI-MRS spectrum of the high-inclination protoplanetary disk around the solar-mass (K0) star MY Lup, obtained as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The spectrum shows an unusually weak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but strong emission from CO$_2$, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This includes the first ever detection of C$^{18}$O$^{16}$O and H$^{13}$CN in an inner disk, as well as tentative detections of C$^{17}$O$^{16}$O and HC$^{15}$N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and emitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold compared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the isotopologue ratios of CO$_2$ and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We suggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner disk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on inclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual chemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to detect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in protoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed to constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.</description>

      <title>Relationship between 2D and 3D Galaxy Stellar Mass and Correlations with Halo Mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the stars in the outer regions of massive galaxies trace halo mass better than the inner regions and that an annular stellar mass provides a low scatter method of selecting galaxy clusters. However, we can only observe galaxies as projected two-dimensional objects on the sky. In this paper, we use a sample of simulated galaxies to study how well galaxy stellar mass profiles in three dimensions correlate with halo mass, and what effects arise when observationally projecting stellar profiles into two dimensions. We compare 2D and 3D outer stellar mass selections and find that they have similar performance as halo mass proxies and that, surprisingly, a 2D selection sometimes has marginally better performance. We also investigate whether the weak lensing profiles around galaxies selected by 2D outer stellar mass suffer from projection effects. We find that the lensing profiles of samples selected by 2D and 3D definitions are nearly identical, suggesting that the 2D selection does not create a bias. These findings underscore the promise of using outer stellar mass as a tool for identifying galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>AGN Feedback in Quiescent Galaxies at Cosmic Noon Traced by Ionized Gas Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze ionized gas emission lines in deep rest-frame optical spectra of 16 quiescent galaxies at redshift $1.7&lt;z&lt;3.5$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec by the Blue Jay survey. Robust detection of emission lines in $75\%$ of the sample indicates the presence of ongoing ionizing sources in this passive population. The H$\alpha$ line luminosities confirm that the population is quiescent, with star formation rates that are at least ten times lower than the main sequence of star formation. The quiescent sample is clearly separate from the star-forming population in line diagnostic diagrams, and occupies a region usually populated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). Analysis of the observed line ratios, equivalent widths, and velocity dispersions leads us to conclude that in most cases the gas is ionized by AGN activity, despite the lack of X-ray detections. A subset of the sample also hosts ionized and/or neutral outflows. Our results show, for the first time using a representative sample, that low luminosity AGN are extremely common among quiescent galaxies at high redshift. These low luminosity AGN may play a key role in quenching star formation and in maintaining massive galaxies quiescent from Cosmic Noon to $z\sim0$.</description>

      <title>Segue 2 Recently Collided with the Cetus-Palca Stream: New Opportunities to Constrain Dark Matter in an Ultra-Faint Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar streams in the Milky Way are promising detectors of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos predicted by $\Lambda$CDM. Passing subhalos induce perturbations in streams that indicate the presence of the subhalos. Understanding how known DM-dominated satellites impact streams is a crucial step towards using stream perturbations to constrain the properties of dark perturbers. Here, we cross-match a \textit{Gaia} EDR3 and SEGUE member catalog of the Cetus-Palca stream (CPS) with H3 for additional radial velocity measurements and fit the orbit of the CPS using this 6-D data. We demonstrate for the first time that the ultra-faint dwarf Segue 2 had a recent (77$\pm$5 Myr ago) close flyby (within the stream's 2$\sigma$ width) with the CPS. This interaction enables constraints on Segue 2's mass and density profile at larger radii ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ kpc) than are probed by its stars ($\mathcal{O}(10)$ pc). While Segue 2 is not expected to strongly affect the portion of the stream covered by our 6-D data, we predict that if Segue 2's mass within $\sim 6$ kpc is $5\times 10^9\,M_\odot$, the CPS's velocity dispersion will be $\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ larger at $\phi_1&gt;20^\circ$ than at $\phi_1&lt;0^\circ$. If no such heating is detected, Segue 2's mass cannot exceed $10^9\,M_\odot$ within $\sim 6$ kpc. The proper motion distribution of the CPS near the impact site is mildly sensitive to the shape of Segue 2's density profile. This study presents a critical test for frameworks designed to constrain properties of dark subhalos from stream perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space telescope has discovered an abundant population of broad line emitters, typical signposts for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Many of these sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming them `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to estimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the \Obelisk{} cosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little Red Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole population. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as galaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little attenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD selection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue filters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs are also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington, and/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.</description>

      <title>The formation histories of massive and quiescent galaxies in the 3 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 Universe</title>

Abstract: We present the formation histories of 19 massive ($&gt;3X10^{10}M_\odot$) quiescent (sSFR$&lt;0.15Gyr^{-1}$) galaxy candidates at z~3.0-4.5 observed using JWST/NIRSpec. This completes the spectroscopic confirmation of the 24 K-selected quiescent galaxy sample from the ZFOURGE and 3DHST surveys (Schreiber et al. 2018a). Utilizing Prism $1-5\mu m$ spectroscopy, we confirm that all 12 sources that eluded confirmation by ground-based spectroscopy lie at z&gt;3, resulting in a spectroscopically confirmed number density of $\sim1.4X10^{-5}Mpc^{-3}$ between $z\sim3-4$. Rest-frame U-V vs V-J color selections show high effectiveness in identifying quiescent galaxies, with a purity of~90%. Our analysis shows that parametric star-formation histories (SFHs) from FAST++ and binned SFHs from Prospector on average yield consistent results, revealing diverse formation and quenching times. The oldest galaxy formed $~6X10^{10}M_\odot$ by $z\sim10$ and has been quiescent for over 1 Gyr at z~3.2. We detect two galaxies with ongoing star formation and six with active galactic nuclei (AGN). We demonstrate that the choice of stellar population models, stellar libraries, and nebular or AGN contributions does not significantly affect the derived average SFHs of the galaxies. We demonstrate that extending spectral fitting beyond the rest-frame optical regime reduces the inferred average star formation rates in the earliest time bins of the SFH reconstruction. The assumed SFH prior influences the star formation rate at early times, where spectral diagnostic power is limited. Simulated z~3 quiescent galaxies from IllustrisTNG, SHARK, and Magneticum broadly match the average SFHs of the observed sample but struggle to capture the full diversity, particularly at early stages. Our results emphasize the need for mechanisms that rapidly build stellar mass and quench star formation within the first billion years of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Velocity dispersion function evolution from strong lensing statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redshift and size distributions of galaxy scale strong lenses depend on the evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We use this dependence to constrain the velocity dispersion function (VDF) evolution from the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample of lenses in the redshift range 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75. Our modeling of the lens population includes lens identifiability given survey parameters, and constrains the evolution of the VDF based on the redshift distributions of sources and lenses as well as the distribution of Einstein radii. We consider five different assumptions for the reference VDF at redshift zero and two sets of scaling relations for the VDF. We find that in all cases the observed lens sample favors a slow evolution of both the VDF normalization factor and the VDF characteristic velocity with redshift which is consistent with a VDF that is constant in redshift for z &lt; 0.75.</description>

      <title>ADF22-WEB: A giant barred spiral starburst galaxy in the z = 3.1 SSA22 protocluster core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present-day universe, the most massive galaxies are ellipticals located in the cores of galaxy clusters, harboring the heaviest super-massive black holes (SMBHs). However the mechanisms that drive the early growth phase and subsequent transformation of these morphology and kinematics of galaxies remain elusive. Here we report (sub)kiloparsec scale observations of stars, gas, and dust in ADF22.A1, a bright dusty starburst galaxy at z=3.1, hosting a heavily obscured active galactic nucleus and residing in a proto-cluster core. ADF22.A1 is a giant spiral galaxy with the kinematics of a rotating disk with rotation velocity Vrot=530+/-10km/s and diameter larger than 30 kpc. The high specific stellar angular momentum of this system, j*=3400+/-600 kpc km/s, requires a mechanism to effectively spin-up ADF22.A1, indicating the importance of accretion from the cosmic web to supply both gas and angular momentum to galaxies in their early gas-rich starburst phase. In its inner region, gas flows along dust lanes in a bar connected with the bright dusty core and the estimated mass ratio of a bulge to SMBH matches the local relation, suggesting that bars are a key mechanism to shape the early co-evolution of these components. Comparison with cosmological simulations shows that ADF22.A1 will likely evolve into a massive elliptical at the present day, experiencing a significant reduction in angular momentum associated with subsequent galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-virial Gas? II: Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a super-virial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) $\sim7$ in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy-formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\alpha$, SiXIV K$\alpha$, and NeX K$\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent simulation results.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming gravitational wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Testing Cotton gravity as dark matter substitute with weak lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harada proposed a modified theory of gravity called Cotton gravity, and argued that it successfully explains the rotation curves of $84$ galaxies without the need of dark matter. In this work we use galaxy-galaxy lensing technique to test whether the modification effect of Cotton gravity can indeed be a viable substitute for dark matter. Using the spherically symmetric solution of Cotton gravity, we obtain the deflection angle via Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the weak lensing shear. We use five galaxy catalogs divided in 5 stellar mass bins from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7), each of which is further divided into blue star forming galaxy and red passive galaxy sub-catalogs. We find that Cotton gravity on its own has significant deviation from the measured galaxy-galaxy lensing signals, thus it cannot replace the role of dark matter. If we consider the combination of dark matter and Cotton gravity, the modification is tightly constrained. Our analysis also applies to other modified gravity theories whose an additional linear term appears in the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Cooling rate and turbulence in the intracluster medium of the cool-core cluster Abell 2667</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the thermal X-ray emission from the intracluster medium (ICM) in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2667 ($z=0.23$). Our goal is to detect low-temperature ($&lt;2$ keV) X-ray emitting gas, potentially associated to a cooling flow that connects the hot ICM reservoir to the cold gas phase responsible for star formation and supermassive black hole feeding. We use new deep XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS data, combined with archival Chandra data, to perform a spectral analysis for the core region. We find 1$\sigma$ upper limits to the cooling gas fraction of $\sim$40 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ and $\sim$50-60 $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ in the temperature ranges 0.5-1 keV and 1-2 keV, respectively. The lack of OVII, FeXXI-FeXXII, and FeXVII emission lines in the RGS spectra suggest that the fraction of gas cooling below 1 keV is limited to a few tens of $\rm M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$ at most. However, we detect several lines (e.g. SiXIV, MgXII, FeXXIII/FeXXIV, NeX, OVIII$\alpha$) that allow us to estimate a 1$\sigma$ upper limit for turbulent broadening of $\sim$320 km $\rm s^{-1}$, higher that other cool-core clusters such as Abell 1835, implying mechanisms that boost turbulence in Abell 2667's atmosphere. Imaging analysis of Chandra data suggests the presence of a cold front, possibly lined to sloshing or ICM cavities. However, current data do not clearly identify the physical mechanism driving turbulence. These finding indicate that Abell 2667 is similar to other low-redshift cool-core clusters, though the large upper limit on turbulence hints at significant ICM heating, which may suppress cooling for extended periods and contribute to future condensation events.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Multi-band Absolute Magnitudes and Color Indexes of the Tip of Red Giant Branch Stars on Metallicity in the Galactic Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tip of red giant branch (TRGB) stars have attracted intensive attention in recent years because their $I$-band absolute magnitudes, $M_\rm I$, are often used for distance calibration in the Hubble constant measurements because of its almost independence on metallicity ([Fe/H]). However, a discrepancy exists between various studies and the theoretical stellar model predicts dependence of their luminosity on [Fe/H]. Here we present a careful study of the dependence of absolute magnitudes and color indexes on metallicity in optical and near-infrared bands. With the TRGB stars identified in 33 Galactic globular clusters by the reddest color in the $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ vs. $G_{\rm RP}$ diagram, it is confirmed that $M_\rm I$ is almost constant of $-4.017 \pm 0.036 \pm 0.027$ mag when $[\rm Fe/H]&lt;-1.2$, which would give $H_0=70.86\pm 1.2\pm0.9$ $\rm kms^{-1} Mp c^{-1}$ with this updated luminosity calibration for type Ia supernovae. However, for $[\rm Fe/H]&gt;-1.2$, $M_\rm I$ is found to become fainter with lower metallicity, which would lead to a larger Hubble constant. In the optical $G_{\rm BP}, G_{\rm RP}$ and $V$ bands, the absolute magnitude of TRGB stars tends to increase with metallicity, while in the infrared $J, H$, and $K_{\rm S}$ bands, the variation with metallicity shows an inverse tendency. In addition, the analytical relations of the color indexes with metallicity are presented, which have smaller dispersion than those derived for the corresponding absolute magnitudes.</description>
