      <title>On gauge theory and parallel transport in principal 2-bundles over Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interplay between some ideas in traditional gauge theory and certain concepts in fibered categories. We accomplish this by introducing a notion of a principal Lie 2-group bundle over a Lie groupoid and studying its connection structures, gauge transformations, and parallel transport.
  We obtain a Lie 2-group torsor version of the one-one correspondence between fibered categories and pseudofunctors. This results in a classification of our principal 2-bundles based on their underlying fibration structures. This allows us to extend a class of our principal 2-bundles to be defined over differentiable stacks presented by the base Lie groupoids. We construct a short exact sequence of VB-groupoids, namely, the 'Atiyah sequence' associated to our principal 2-bundles. Splitting and splitting up to a natural isomorphism of our Atiyah sequence, respectively, gives us notions of 'strict connections' and 'semi-strict connections' on our principal 2-bundles. We describe such connections in terms of Lie 2-algebra valued 1-forms on the total Lie groupoids. The underlying fibration structure of our 2-bundle provides an existence criterion for strict and semi-strict connections. We study the action of the 2-group of gauge transformations on the groupoid of strict and semi-strict connections, and interestingly, we observe an extended symmetry of semi-strict connections. We demonstrate an interrelationship between `differential geometric connection-induced horizontal path lifting property in traditional principal bundles' and the `category theoretic cartesian lifting of morphisms in fibered categories' by developing a theory of connection-induced parallel transport along a particular class of Haefliger paths in the base Lie groupoid of our principle 2-bundles. Finally, we employ our results to introduce a notion of parallel transport along Haefliger paths in the setup of VB-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Tensor products of Leibniz bimodules and Grothendieck rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define three different notions of tensor products for Leibniz bimodules. The ``natural" tensor product of Leibniz bimodules is not always a Leibniz bimodule. In order to fix this, we introduce the notion of a weak Leibniz bimodule and show that the ``natural" tensor product of weak bimodules is again a weak bimodule. Moreover, it turns out that weak Leibniz bimodules are modules over a cocommutative Hopf algebra canonically associated to the Leibniz algebra. Therefore, the category of all weak Leibniz bimodules is symmetric monoidal and the full subcategory of finite-dimensional weak Leibniz bimodules is rigid and pivotal. On the other hand, we introduce two truncated tensor products of Leibniz bimodules which are again Leibniz bimodules. These tensor products induce a non-associative multiplication on the Grothendieck group of the category of finite-dimensional Leibniz bimodules. In particular, we prove that in characteristic zero for a finite-dimensional solvable Leibniz algebra this Grothendieck ring is an alternative power-associative commutative Jordan ring, but for a finite-dimensional non-zero semi-simple Leibniz algebra it is neither alternative nor a Jordan ring.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for cognitive structures and processes underlying innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business innovations are often arising from new combinations of pre-existing systems into new ones, coherently assembling features from their sources. We propose an abstract mathematical concept from category theory, the presheaf, to efficiently represent such coherent feature combinations. Moreover, operations on presheaves will allow us to formally describe and analyze business innovations that arise from novel mergings of systems from different domains. Equipped with such tools we provide an example by analyzing a successful case of such type of recombinant innovation, the digital hub concept proposed by Steve Jobs. The example shows how our framework can be used to bring formal rigor while preserving a fundamentally qualitative reasoning style.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of relative stability conditions on triangulated categories with respect to left admissible subcategories, based on arXiv:math/0212237, and demonstrate the deformation of relative stability conditions via the deformation of gluing stability conditions in arXiv:0902.0323. The motivation for this concept stems from the discussions in arXiv:2004.04831 concerning the relationship between Bridgeland stability and the existence of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics on line bundles.</description>

Abstract: We study $\mathrm{W}^*$-categories, and explain the ways in which complete $\mathrm{W}^*$-categories behave like categorified Hilbert spaces. Every $\mathrm{W}^*$-category $C$ admits a canonical categorified inner product $\langle\,\,,\,\rangle_{\mathrm{Hilb}}\,:\,\overline C\times C\,\to\, \mathrm{Hilb}$. Moreover, if $C$ and $D$ are complete $\mathrm{W}^*$-categories there is an antilinear equivalence $$\dagger:\mathrm{Func}(C,D) \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Func}(D,C)$$ characterised by $\langle c,F^\dagger(d)\rangle_{\mathrm{Hilb}} \simeq \langle F(c),d\rangle_{\mathrm{Hilb}}$, for $c\in C$ and $d \in D$.</description>

      <title>Envelopes for Algebraic Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize Lurie's construction of the symmetric monoidal envelope of an $\infty$-operad to the setting of algebraic patterns. This envelope becomes fully faithful when sliced over the envelope of the terminal object, and we characterize its essential image. Using this, we prove a comparison result that allows us to compare analogues of $\infty$-operads over various algebraic patterns. In particular, we show that the $G$-$\infty$-operads of Nardin-Shah are equivalent to "fibrous patterns" over the $(2, 1)$-category $\mathrm{Span}(\mathbb{F}_G)$ of spans of finite $G$-sets. When $G$ is trivial this means that Lurie's $\infty$-operads can equivalently be defined over $\mathrm{Span}(\mathbb{F})$ instead of $\mathbb{F}_*$.</description>

      <title>CaTT contexts are finite computads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two novel descriptions of weak {\omega}-categories have been recently proposed, using type-theoretic ideas. The first one is the dependent type theory CaTT whose models are {\omega}-categories. The second is a recursive description of a category of computads together with an adjunction to globular sets, such that the algebras for the induced monad are again {\omega}-categories. We compare the two descriptions by showing that there exits a fully faithful morphism of categories with families from the syntactic category of CaTT to the opposite of the category of computads, which gives an equivalence on the subcategory of finite computads. We derive a more direct connection between the category of models of CaTT and the category of algebras for the monad on globular sets, induced by the adjunction with computads.</description>

      <title>An Ultrametric for Cartesian Differential Categories for Taylor Series Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cartesian differential categories provide a categorical framework for multivariable differential calculus and also the categorical semantics of the differential $\lambda$-calculus. Taylor series expansion is an important concept for both differential calculus and the differential $\lambda$-calculus. In differential calculus, a function is equal to its Taylor series if its sequence of Taylor polynomials converges to the function in the analytic sense. On the other hand, for the differential $\lambda$-calculus, one works in a setting with an appropriate notion of algebraic infinite sums to formalize Taylor series expansion. In this paper, we provide a formal theory of Taylor series in an arbitrary Cartesian differential category without the need for converging limits or infinite sums. We begin by developing the notion of Taylor polynomials of maps in a Cartesian differential category and then show how comparing Taylor polynomials of maps induces an ultrapseudometric on the homsets. We say that a Cartesian differential category is Taylor if maps are entirely determined by their Taylor polynomials. The main results of this paper are that in a Taylor Cartesian differential category, the induced ultrapseudometrics are ultrametrics and that for every map $f$, its Taylor series converges to $f$ with respect to this ultrametric. This framework recaptures both Taylor series expansion in differential calculus via analytic methods and in categorical models of the differential $\lambda$-calculus (or Differential Linear Logic) via infinite sums.</description>

      <title>Categorical spectra as pointed $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lessard's $\mathbb{Z}$-categories are an analogue of $\omega$-categories possessing cells in all positive and negative dimensions. Categorical spectra, developed by Stefanich, are an analogue of spectra obtained by replacing the suspension of pointed $\infty$-groupoids by that of pointed $(\infty,\omega)$-categories. We give an $\infty$-categorical definition of weak $\mathbb{Z}$-categories (alias $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories), and show categorical spectra to be equivalent to pointed $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories. In particular, we show that the stable cells of categorical spectra coincide with the natural cells of $(\infty,\mathbb{Z})$-categories, and recover Lessard's description of spectra as pointed weak $\mathbb{Z}$-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Functors Preserving Effective Descent Morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective descent morphisms, originally defined in Grothendieck descent theory, form a class of special morphisms within a category. Essentially, an effective descent morphism enables bundles over its codomain to be fully described as bundles over its domain endowed with additional algebraic structure, called descent data. Like the study of epimorphisms, studying effective descent morphisms is interesting in its own right, providing deeper insights into the category under consideration. Moreover, studying these morphisms is part of the foundations of several applications of descent theory, notably including Janelidze-Galois theory, also known as categorical Galois theory.
  Traditionally, the study of effective descent morphisms has focused on investigating and exploiting the reflection properties of certain functors. In contrast, we introduce a novel approach by establishing general results on the preservation of effective descent morphisms. We demonstrate that these preservation results enhance the toolkit for studying such morphisms, by observing that all Grothendieck (op)fibrations satisfying mild conditions fit our framework. To illustrate these findings, we provide several examples of Grothendieck (op)fibrations that preserve effective descent morphisms, including topological functors and other forgetful functors of significant interest in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We develop an analog of Dugger and Spivak's necklace formula providing an explicit description of the Segal space generated by an arbitrary simplicial space. We apply this to obtain a formula for the Segalification of $n$-fold simplicial spaces, a new proof of the invariance of right fibrations, and a new construction of the Boardman-Vogt tensor product of $\infty$-operads, for which we also derive an explicit formula.</description>

      <title>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Categories for Compositional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, conducting task composition by forming cohesive, executable sequences from multiple tasks remains challenging. However, the ability to (de)compose tasks is a linchpin in developing robotic systems capable of learning complex behaviors. Yet, compositional reinforcement learning is beset with difficulties, including the high dimensionality of the problem space, scarcity of rewards, and absence of system robustness after task composition. To surmount these challenges, we view task composition through the prism of category theory -- a mathematical discipline exploring structures and their compositional relationships. The categorical properties of Markov decision processes untangle complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, allowing for strategical reduction of dimensionality, facilitating more tractable reward structures, and bolstering system robustness. Experimental results support the categorical theory of reinforcement learning by enabling skill reduction, reuse, and recycling when learning complex robotic arm tasks.</description>
