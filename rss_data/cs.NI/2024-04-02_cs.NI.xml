      <title>A Fast Percolation-Dijkstra Routing Method for Mega-Constellation Backbone Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time routing for satellite communication of the mega-constellations is being challenged due to the large-scale of network nodes, especially on devices with limited computation such as onboard embedded systems. In this paper, a fast routing method is proposed for mega-constellation backbone networks. Firstly, inspired by the regularity and sparse characteristics of mega-constellations, the 4-degree percolation theory is proposed to describe the node search process. Then, dynamic minimum search and mapping methods are used to narrow down the traversal range. The proposed method performs as well as the heap-optimized Dijkstra algorithm with less memory space and dynamic access. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly reduce routing computation time, especially on the onboard, edge-computing or other computation-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Distributed Satellite-Terrestrial Cooperative Routing Strategy Based on Minimum Hop-Count Analysis in Mega LEO Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation is promising in achieving global coverage with high capacity. However, forwarding packets in mega constellation faces long end-to-end delay caused by multi-hop routing and high-complexity routing table construction, which will detrimentally impair the network transmission efficiency. To overcome this issue, a distributed low-complexity satellite-terrestrial cooperative routing approach is proposed in this paper, and its core idea is that each node forwards packets to next-hop node under the constraints of minimum end-to-end hop-count and queuing delay. Particularly, to achieve an accurate and low-complexity minimum end-to-end hop-count estimation in satellite-terrestrial cooperative routing scenario, we first introduce a satellite real-time position based graph (RTPG) to simplify the description of three-dimensional constellation, and further abstract RTPG into a key node based graph (KNBG). Considering the frequent regeneration of KNBG due to satellite movement, a low complexity generation method of KNBG is studied as well. Finally, utilizing KNBG as input, we design the minimum end-to-end hop-count estimation method (KNBG-MHCE). Meanwhile, the computational complexity, routing path survival probability and practical implementation of our proposal are all deeply discussed. Extensive simulations are also conducted in systems with Ka and laser band inter-satellite links to verify the superiority of our proposal.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting web servers through Transformer-encoded HTTP response headers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explored leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning, big data, and natural language processing to enhance the detection of vulnerable web server versions. Focusing on improving accuracy and specificity over rule-based systems, we conducted experiments by sending various ambiguous and non-standard HTTP requests to 4.77 million domains and capturing HTTP response status lines. We represented these status lines through training a BPE tokenizer and RoBERTa encoder for unsupervised masked language modeling. We then dimensionality reduced and concatenated encoded response lines to represent each domain's web server. A Random Forest and multilayer perceptron (MLP) classified these web servers, and achieved 0.94 and 0.96 macro F1-score, respectively, on detecting the five most popular origin web servers. The MLP achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.55 on classifying 347 major type and minor version pairs. Analysis indicates that our test cases are meaningful discriminants of web server types. Our approach demonstrates promise as a powerful and flexible alternative to rule-based systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning with Reconstruction Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most applications of utilizing neural networks for mathematical optimization, a dedicated model is trained for each specific optimization objective. However, in many scenarios, several distinct yet correlated objectives or tasks often need to be optimized on the same set of problem inputs. Instead of independently training a different neural network for each problem separately, it would be more efficient to exploit the correlations between these objectives and to train multiple neural network models with shared model parameters and feature representations. To achieve this, this paper first establishes the concept of common information: the shared knowledge required for solving the correlated tasks, then proposes a novel approach for model training by adding into the model an additional reconstruction stage associated with a new reconstruction loss. This loss is for reconstructing the common information starting from a selected hidden layer in the model. The proposed approach encourages the learned features to be general and transferable, and therefore can be readily used for efficient transfer learning. For numerical simulations, three applications are studied: transfer learning on classifying MNIST handwritten digits, the device-to-device wireless network power allocation, and the multiple-input-single-output network downlink beamforming and localization. Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach is highly efficient in data and model complexity, is resilient to over-fitting, and has competitive performances.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins for Supporting AI Research with Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), which are virtual environments that simulate, predict, and optimize the performance of their physical counterparts, are envisioned to be essential technologies for advancing next-generation wireless networks. While DTs have been studied extensively for wireless networks, their use in conjunction with autonomous vehicles with programmable mobility remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we study DTs used as a development environment to design, deploy, and test artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that use real-time observations, e.g. radio key performance indicators, for vehicle trajectory and network optimization decisions in an autonomous vehicle networks (AVN). We first compare and contrast the use of simulation, digital twin (software in the loop (SITL)), sandbox (hardware-in-the-loop (HITL)), and physical testbed environments for their suitability in developing and testing AI algorithms for AVNs. We then review various representative use cases of DTs for AVN scenarios. Finally, we provide an example from the NSF AERPAW platform where a DT is used to develop and test AI-aided solutions for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for localizing a signal source based solely on link quality measurements. Our results in the physical testbed show that SITL DTs, when supplemented with data from real-world (RW) measurements and simulations, can serve as an ideal environment for developing and testing innovative AI solutions for AVNs.</description>

      <title>Age of Information in a Single-Source Generate-at-Will Dual-Server Status Update System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study age of information (AoI) in a single-source dual-server status update system for the generate at will (GAW) scenario, consisting of an information source, dual servers, and a monitor. For this system, the method of stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) was used to obtain the mean AoI for the work-conserving ZW (zero wait) policy with out-of-order packet discarding at the monitor. In this paper, we propose a non-work-conserving F/P (freeze/preempt) policy for which the sampling and transmission process is frozen for an Erlang distributed amount of time upon each transmission, and out-of-order packets are preempted immediately at the source, rather than being discarded at the monitor upon reception. We use the absorbing Markov chain (AMC) method to obtain the exact distributions of AoI and also the peak AoI (PAoI) processes, for both ZW and F/P policies. Numerical results are presented for the validation of the proposed analytical model and a comparative evaluation of ZW and F/P policies.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Power Factor Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uplink sum-throughput of distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks depends majorly on Access point (AP)-User Equipment (UE) association and power control. The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing these two problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load.</description>
