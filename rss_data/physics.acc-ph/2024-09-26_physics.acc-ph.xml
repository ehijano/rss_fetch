      <title>Development of a novel bunch oscillation recorder with RFSoC technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to achieve unprecedented luminosity levels, but this goal is currently hindered by Sudden Beam Loss (SBL) events. These events not only obstruct luminosity improvement but also pose a significant risk to accelerator components, the Belle II detectors, and the superconducting focusing system, potentially leading to severe damage and quenching of the superconducting system. To address this critical challenge, we have developed a novel Bunch Oscillation Recorder (BOR) based on RFSoC technology. The BOR has demonstrated high precision with a position resolution of 0.03 mm, making it a powerful tool for real-time beam monitoring. In its initial deployment, the BOR successfully recorded multiple SBL events, providing valuable data for further analysis. By strategically positioning BORs at the suspected points of SBL origin, we aim to directly identify sources of beam instability. We anticipate that this portable, high-speed BOR monitor will play a crucial role in resolving the SBL issue, ultimately helping achieve SuperKEKB's luminosity targets.</description>

      <title>DA{\Phi}NE -2023/24 Activity report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DA{\Phi}NE operations during the last year have been devoted to deliver a statistically significant data sample to perform the first-ever measurement of kaonic deuterium X-ray transitions to the fundamental level. Operations for the SIDDHARTA-2 detector using a deuterium gas target started officially on the second half of May 2023, and have been organized in several runs here described.</description>

      <title>N-dimensional maximum-entropy tomography via particle sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative implementation of the MENT algorithm, an exact maximum-entropy algorithm used to infer a phase space distribution from its projections. A key step in the MENT algorithm is to compute the distribution's projections via numerical integration. In this approach, the run time scales quickly with the phase space dimension and measurement resolution. The proposed MENT implementation computes the projections via particle sampling, rather than numerical integration, eliminating the dependence on the measurement resolution. Furthermore, with the appropriate sampling algorithm, the particle-based approach scales to $N$-dimensions without computer memory limitations. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate MENT convergence in four dimensions using a grid-based sampling method and in six dimensions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.</description>

      <title>High-count-rate Particle Tracking in Proton and Carbon Radiotherapy with Timepix2 Operated in Ultra-Short Acquisition Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the operational acquisition time limits of Timepix3 and Timepix2 detectors operated in frame mode for high-count rate of high deposited energy transfer particles. Measurements were performed using alpha particles from a 241Am laboratory source and proton and carbon ion beams from a synchrotron accelerator. The particle count rate upper limit is determined by overlapping per-pixel particle signals, identifiable by the hits per pixel counter &gt; 2, indicating the need to decrease acquisition time. On the other hand, the lower limit is the time required to collect the particle deposited charge while maintaining spectral properties. Different acquisition times were evaluated for an AdvaPIX Timepix3 detector (500 um Silicon sensor) with standard per-pixel DAC settings and a Minipix Timepix2 detector (300 um Silicon sensor) with standard and customized settings the pulse shaping parameter and threshold. For AdvaPIX Timepix3, spectra remained accurate down to 100 us frame acquisition time; at 10 us, loss of collected charge occurred, suggesting either avoiding this acquisition time or applying a correction. Timepix2 allowed acquisition times down to 100 ns for single particle track measurements even for high energy loss, enabled by a new Timepix2 feature delaying shutter closure until full particle charge collection. This work represents the first measurement utilizing Timepix-chips pixel detectors in an accelerator beam of clinical energy and intensity without the need to decrease the beam current. This is made possible by exploiting the short shutter feature in Timepix2 and a customized per-pixel energy calibration of the Timepix2 detector with a larger discharging signal value which allowed for a shorter time-over-threshold (ToT) signal. These customized settings extend the operation of the pixel detectors to higher event rates up to 10^9 particles/cm^2/s.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of a high-level control system for a medical isochronous cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MEDICYC (MEDical CYClotron) is an isochronous cyclotron dedicated to radiotherapy which was built and commissioned in Nice, France, in 1990 by a local team aided by experts from CERN. The cyclotron accelerates negative H to a maximum energy of 65 MeV and uses stripping to extract a proton beam. Its primary purpose is treating ocular melanoma by protontherapy but a significant research activity is also present on beam-lines dedicated for this purpose. An extensive refurbishment program of the cyclotron has been started to cope with the end-of-life and/or the obsolescence of several sub-systems. In this context, a new high-level cyclotron control system has been developed and commissioned in 2021-2024. The primary responsibility of the system is the high-level coordination of the source, the RF system, the beam-line and cyclotron magnets, to produce and deliver a beam with a given set of characteristics. A secondary responsibility is the collection, visualization and analysis of sub-system and beam data for monitoring and pre-emptive fault detection. In this contribution, the control system software architecture is presented and the infrastructure on which the systems are deployed is laid out.</description>
