      <title>A geometric study of BZ operator on representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ over non-archimedean field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we geometrically study the partial Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator introduced in the author's thesis, which generalizes the original Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator. We relate the partial Bernstein-Zelevinsky operator to the geometric induction of Lusztig and then perform explicit computations in special cases. Finally, we develop a symmetric reduction to the previously mentioned special cases</description>

      <title>On certain conjectures of Clozel and Shahidi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups $\mathrm{G}_n$, we prove the enhanced Shahidi conjecture on generic representations and the Clozel conjecture on unramified representations, for local Arthur packets. These results have interesting global implications, in particular, we confirm a conjecture of Arthur and Clozel on the local components of automorphic representations in the discrete spectrum. As further applications, towards the generalized Ramanujan problem as posted by Sarnak, we show that the Ramanujan conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ implies a sequence of conjectures of Clozel on local components of automorphic representations of $\mathrm{G}_n$.</description>

      <title>On easily computable indecomposable dimension group algebras, and group codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An easily computable dimension (or ECD) group code in the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q}G$ is an ideal of dimension less than or equal to $p=char(\mathbb{F}_{q})$ that is generated by an idempotent. This paper introduces an easily computable indecomposable dimension (or ECID) group algebra as a finite group algebra for which all group codes generated by primitive idempotents are ECD. Several characterizations are given for these algebras. In addition, some arithmetic conditions to determine whether a group algebra is ECID are presented, in the case it is semisimple. In the non-semisimple case, these algebras have finite representation type where the Sylow $p$-subgroups of the underlying group are simple. The dimension and some lower bounds for the minimum Hamming distance of group codes in these algebras are given together with some arithmetical tests of primitivity of idempotents. Examples illustrating the main results are presented.</description>

      <title>What is the Modular Fourier Transform?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as an isomorphism of the group algebra of a cyclic group to its decomposition in terms of irreducible representations when the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the group. We describe the DFT when $p|n$ by factoring $x^N - 1$ over finite fields. For the symmetric group, the Fourier transform is implemented using representations, Specht modules $S^\lambda$ for partitions $\lambda$, and Maschke's theorem. In the modular case, we construct the Pierce decomposition using central primitive orthogonal idempotents $e_i$ in SageMath, yielding a change-of-basis matrix which generalizes the DFT.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A=\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb N}A_i$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. Under the assumptions that $A$ is ring-indecomposable and $A_0$ has finite global dimension, we show that the stable category $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ always admits an (explicitly constructed) silting object. We also show that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter $p^A_\mathrm{av} \in {\mathbb Q}$ of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^\mathrm{b}(\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} A)$ of a smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurface $\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} A$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</description>

      <title>Kostka polynomials of $G(\ell,1,m)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each integer $n, m, \ell \ge 1$ such that $n &gt; m$, we exhibit an equivalence between the category of polynomial modules over a paraholic subalgebra $\mathfrak p$ of an affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(n\ell)$ and the module category of the smash product algebra $A$ of the complex reflection group $G(\ell,1,m)$ with $\mathbb C [X_1,\ldots,X_m]$. Then, we transfer the collection of $\mathfrak p$-modules considered in [Feigin-Makedonskyi-Khoroshkhin, arXiv:2311.12673] to $A$. Applying the Lusztig-Shoji algorithm [Shoji, Invent. Math. 74 (1983)] (or rather its homological variant [K. Ann. Sci. ENS 48(5) (2015)]), we conclude that the multiplicity counts of these modules yield the Kostka polynomials attached to limit symbols in the sense of [Shoji, ASPM 40 (2004)]. This particularly settles a conjecture of Shoji [loc. cit. \S 3.13] and answers a question in [Shoji, Sci. China Math. 61 (2018)].</description>

      <title>On $C_n^{(1)}$-Geometric Crystal and its Ultradiscretization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\ge$ be an affine Lie algebra with index set $I = \{0, 1, 2, \cdots , n\}$ and $\ge^L$ be its Langlands dual. It is conjectured that for each Dynkin node $i \in I \setminus \{0\}$ the affine Lie algebra $\ge$ has a positive geometric crystal whose ultra-discretization is isomorphic to the limit of a certain coherent family of perfect crystals for the Langland dual $\ge^L$. In this paper we construct positive geometric crystals for $\mathcal{V}(C_n^{(1)})$ in the level zero fundamental spin $C_n^{(1)}$- module $W(\varpi_n)$ for $n = 2, 3,4$ and show that its ultra-discretization is isomorphic to the limit $B^{n, \infty}$ of a coherent family $\{B^{n, l}\}_{l \geq 1}$ of perfect crystals for the Langland dual $D_n^{(2)}$ which proves the conjecture in these cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $(\overline{\rho}, \mathcal{H})$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields (which is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To every compact oriented surface that is composed entirely out of 2-dimensional 0- and 1-handles, we construct a dg category using structures arising in Khovanov homology. These dg categories form part of the 2-dimensional layer (a.k.a. modular functor) of a categorified version of the sl(2) Turaev--Viro topological field theory. As a byproduct, we obtain a unified perspective on several hitherto disparate constructions in categorified quantum topology, including the Rozansky--Willis invariants, Asaeda--Przytycki--Sikora homologies for links in thickened surfaces, categorified Jones--Wenzl projectors and associated spin networks, and dg horizontal traces.</description>

      <title>Towards the wall-crossing of locally $\mathbb{Q}_p$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ for a $p$-adic field $K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We study the locally $\mathbb{Q}_p$-analytic representations $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ of integral weights that appear in spaces of $p$-adic automorphic representations. We conjecture that the translation of $\pi$ to the singular block has an internal structure which is compatible with certain algebraic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$, analogously to the mod $p$ local-global compatibility conjecture of Breuil-Herzig-Hu-Morra-Schraen. We next make some conjectures and speculations on the wall-crossings of $\pi$. In particular, when $\pi$ is associated to a two dimensional de Rham Galois representation, we make conjectures and speculations on the relation between the Hodge filtrations of $\rho$ and the wall-crossings of $\pi$, which have a flavour of the Breuil-Strauch conjecture. We collect some results towards the conjectures and speculations.</description>

      <title>On the representation theory of the symmetry group of the Cantor set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work with Harman, we introduced a new class of representations for an oligomorphic group $G$, depending on an auxiliary piece of data called a measure. In this paper, we look at this theory when $G$ is the symmetry group of the Cantor set. We show that $G$ admits exactly two measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. The representation theory of $(G, \mu)$ is the linearization of the category of $\mathbf{F}_2$-vector spaces, studied in recent work of the author and closely connected to work of Kuhn and Kov\'acs. The representation theory of $(G, \nu)$ is the linearization of the category of vector spaces over the Boolean semi-ring (or, equivalently, the correspondence category), studied by Bouc--Th\'evenaz. The latter case yields an important counterexample in the general theory.</description>

      <title>Representations of Kronecker quivers and Steiner bundles on Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{k}$ be an algebraically closed field. Connections between representations of the generalized Kronecker quivers $K_r$ and vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$ have been known for quite some time. This article is concerned with a particular aspect of this correspondence, involving more generally Steiner bundles on Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_d(\mathbb{k}^r)$ and certain full subcategories $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$ of relative projective $K_r$-representations. Building on a categorical equivalence first explicitly established by Jardim and Prata, we employ representation-theoretic techniques provided by Auslander-Reiten theory and reflection functors to organize indecomposable Steiner bundles in a manner that facilitates the study of bundles enjoying certain properties such as uniformity and homogeneity. Conversely, computational results on Steiner bundles motivate investigations in $\mathrm{rep}_{\mathrm{proj}}(K_r,d)$, which elicit the conceptual sources of some recent work on the subject.
  From a purely representation-theoretic vantage point, our paper initiates the investigation of certain full subcategories of the, for $r\!\ge\!3$, wild category of $K_r$-representations. These may be characterized as being right Hom-orthogonal to certain algebraic families of elementary test modules.</description>

      <title>Index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds -- manifolds whose Lie algebra of vector fields is equipped with a filtration induced from sub-bundles of the tangent bundle. A Heisenberg pseudodifferential operator, elliptic in the calculus of van Erp-Yuncken, is hypoelliptic and Fredholm. Under some geometric conditions, we compute its Fredholm index by means of operator $K$-theory. These results extend the work of Baum-van Erp (Acta Mathematica '2014) for co-oriented contact manifolds to a methodology for solving this index problem geometrically on Carnot manifolds.
  Under the assumption that the Carnot manifold is regular, i.e. has isomorphic osculating Lie algebras in all fibres, and admits a flat coadjoint orbit, the methodology derived from Baum-van Erp's work is developed in full detail. In this case, we develope $K$-theoretical dualities computing the Fredholm index by means of geometric $K$-homology a la Baum-Douglas. The duality involves a Hilbert space bundle of flat orbit representations. Explicit solutions to the index problem for Toeplitz operators and operators of the form "$\Delta_H+\gamma T$" are computed in geometric $K$-homology, extending results of Boutet de Monvel and Baum-van Erp, respectively, from co-oriented contact manifolds to regular polycontact manifolds.</description>
