      <title>Computer Modelling of Bioheat Transfer for the Analysis of Brightness Temperature Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computer simulation of thermal processes in multilayered biological tissues for the analysis of luminance temperature distributions recorded by microwave radiometry. A mathematical model combining the bioheat transfer equation with the electrodynamic description of electromagnetic field propagation in an inhomogeneous medium has been developed. The model accounts for variations in the thermophysical and dielectric properties of tissues, as well as convective heat exchange with the environment. A parametric analysis was performed to investigate the effects of ambient temperature, heat transfer coefficient, and tissue thermal conductivity on brightness temperature formation. Computational experiments revealed a clear linear dependence of the radiometric signal on both external and internal parameters. It was found that an increase in air temperature by 8 {\deg}C causes a shift in the brightness temperature by about 2 {\deg}C, which exceeds the typical error of the microwave radiometry method and emphasises the need for strict temperature control of the measurement conditions. The developed software system was validated against analytical solutions and experimental data, confirming the accuracy of the calculated temperature fields to within 0.1 {\deg}C. The obtained results lay the groundwork for refining heat transfer models in biological tissues, improving the accuracy of non-invasive thermodiagnostic methods, and integrating computer modelling with machine learning algorithms to enable the automated interpretation of radiometric data.</description>

      <title>DNA Nanostructures Characterized via Dual Nanopore Resensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA nanotechnology uses predictable interactions of nucleic acids to precisely engineer complex nanostructures. Characterizing these self-assembled structures at the single-structure level is crucial for validating their design and functionality. Nanopore sensing is a promising technique for this purpose as it is label-free, solution-based and high-throughput. Here, we present a device that incorporates dynamic feedback to control the translocation of DNA origami structures through and between two nanopores. We observe multiple translocations of the same molecule through the two distinct nanopores as well as measure its time-of-flight between the pores. We use machine learning classification methods in tandem with classical analysis of dwell-time/blockade distributions to analyze the complex multi-translocation events generated by different nanostructures. With this approach, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish DNA nanostructures of different lengths and/or small structural differences, all of which are difficult to detect using conventional, single-nanopore sensing. In addition, we develop a finite element diffusion model of the time-of-flight process and estimate nanostructure size. This work establishes the dual nanopore device as a powerful tool for DNA nanostructure characterization.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the compressibility of the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the human brain, the allowed patterns of activity are constrained by the correlations between brain regions. Yet it remains unclear which correlations -- and how many -- are needed to predict large-scale neural activity. Here, we present an information-theoretic framework to identify the most important correlations, which provide the most accurate predictions of neural states. Applying our framework to cortical activity in humans, we discover that the vast majority of variance in activity is explained by a small number of correlations. This means that the brain is highly compressible: only a sparse network of correlations is needed to predict large-scale activity. We find that this compressibility is strikingly consistent across different individuals and cognitive tasks, and that, counterintuitively, the most important correlations are not necessarily the strongest. Together, these results suggest that nearly all correlations are not needed to predict neural activity, and we provide the tools to uncover the key correlations that are.</description>

      <title>Ambush strategy impacts species predominance and coexistence in rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the adaptive Ambush strategy in cyclic models following the rules of the spatial rock-paper-scissors game. In our model, individuals of one species possess cognitive abilities to perceive environmental cues and assess the local density of the species they dominate in the spatial competition for natural resources. Based on this assessment, they either initiate a direct attack or, if the local concentration of target individuals does not justify the risk, reposition strategically to prepare an ambush. To quantify the evolutionary consequences of these behavioural strategies, we perform stochastic simulations, analysing emergent spatial patterns and the dependence of species densities on the threshold used by individuals to decide between immediate attack or anticipation. Our findings reveal that, despite being designed to enhance efficiency, cognitive strategies can reduce the abundance of the species due to the constraints of cyclic dominance. We identify an optimal decision threshold: attacking only when the local density of target individuals exceeds 15% provides the best balance between selection risk and long-term persistence. Furthermore, the Ambush strategy benefits low-mobility organisms, increasing coexistence probabilities by up to 53%. These results deepen the understanding of adaptive decision-making in spatial ecology, linking cognitive complexity to ecosystem resilience and extinction risk.</description>

      <title>A theory for self-sustained balanced states in absence of strong external currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of $N$ rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength $J_0$, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small $J_0$, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large $J_0$, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing $N$ and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic fluctuation-response theory and its use for gene regulatory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian macroscopic fluctuation theory underpins the understanding of noise in a broad class of nonequilibrium systems. We derive exact fluctuation-response relations linking the power spectral density of stationary fluctuations to the linear response of stable nonequilibrium steady states. Both of these can be determined experimentally and used to reconstruct the kernel of the linearized dynamics and the diffusion matrix, and thus any features of the Gaussian theory. We apply our theory to gene regulatory networks with negative feedback, and derive an explicit internal-external noise decomposition of the power spectral density for any networks, including cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Curvature instability of an active gel growing on a wavy membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion.</description>

      <title>Thickness of epithelia on wavy substrates: measurements and continuous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the thickness of MDCK epithelia grown on substrates with a sinusoidal profile. We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called {\guillemotleft} healing length {\guillemotright} in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Active particles in power-law potentials: steady state distributions and shape transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stationary states of an active Brownian particle (ABP) and run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in two dimensional power-law potentials, in the limit where translational diffusion is negligible. The potential energy of the particle has the form $U(r)\propto r^{n}$, where $n\geq 2$ and even. In two dimensions, we derive the exact equations for the positional probability distribution $\phi({\bf r})$ of ABP ($n\geq 2)$ and RTP ($n=2$), whose solutions are obtained under the assumption that the particle's orientation angle is Gaussian. Both analytical and numerical results show that, in all cases, $\phi({\bf r})$ has compact support and undergoes a phase transition-like shape change as a function of the trap strength. For ABP, our theory predicts a continuous transition in shape for $n=2$ and a discontinuous transition for $n&gt;2$, both of which agree with the simulation results. Simulations suggest the existence of both types of shape transition in the case of RTP as well. For ABP, in the strongly active regime, the orientational probability distribution is unimodal near the outer boundary but becomes bimodal towards the interior, signifying a transition from predominantly radial orientation to orbiting motion. In RTP, the analogous shape transition in the orientational distribution is almost absent.</description>

      <title>Emergent Isotropic-Nematic Transition in 3D Semiflexible Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filament collectives, ranging from motor-driven cytoskeletal filaments to slender organisms such as cyanobacteria and worm aggregates, abound in nature. Yet how activity and flexibility jointly govern their organization, especially Isotropic-Nematic (I-N) transition, remains poorly understood. Performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of 3D active semiflexible polymers with varying flexibility degrees, we show that tangential active forces systematically shift the I-N transition to higher densities, with the shift controlled by the flexibility degree and activity strength. Strikingly, activity alters the nature of the transition: discontinuous at low strengths, continuous at moderate strengths, and ultimately suppressed at high activity levels. The delayed I-N transition originates from enhanced collective bending fluctuations, resulting in chain shrinkage and enlargement of effective confinement tube. At moderate activity levels, these fluctuations can trigger large-scale excitations that stochastically drive temporal transitions between nematic and isotropic states, indicating an activity-induced instability of the nematic field. We summarize this behavior in non-equilibrium state diagrams of density and activity for different flexibility degrees.</description>
