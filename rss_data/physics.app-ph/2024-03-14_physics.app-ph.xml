      <title>Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with Load-Tunable Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the following generic wave problem: is the estimation of an arbitrarily complex linear $N$-port system's scattering matrix possible if waves can be input and output only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ ports are terminated with tunable loads? Fundamentally, this problem is intriguing because it ultimately probes to what extent inherent structure in Maxwell's equations constrains the scattering coefficients. Various limited versions of the problem are of temporary scientific and technological interest, ranging from optimal non-invasive focusing on perturbation-inducing targets in complex media, via the characterization of miniaturized, embedded, receive-only and/or multi-element antenna systems to physics-compliant end-to-end channel models for complex metasurface-programmable "smart radio environments". More generally, solutions to the problem may yield promising measurement techniques to characterize an arbitrary linear $N$-port system with an $N_\mathrm{A}$-port measurement device, where $N_\mathrm{A} \ll N$. We show theoretically that if $N_\mathrm{A}\geq 2$ and at least three distinct tunable loads are available, the problem can be solved except for sign ambiguities on the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports. If the transmission from at least one accessible port to the NDA ports can be measured, the sign ambiguity can be lifted. We corroborate our results with microwave experiments on an 8-port chaotic cavity with $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$. Moreover, we reveal additional constraining structure in Maxwell's equations by showing that a limitation to phase-insensitive measurements only results in a mild additional blockwise phase ambiguity that can be lifted simultaneously with the sign ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Automated discovery of reprogrammable nonlinear dynamic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the rich nonlinear dynamics of highly-deformable materials has the potential to unlock the next generation of functional smart materials and devices. However, unlocking such potential requires effective strategies to spatially design optimal material architectures for desired nonlinear dynamic responses such as guiding of nonlinear elastic waves, energy focusing, and cloaking. Here, we introduce an inverse-design framework for the discovery of flexible mechanical metamaterials with a target nonlinear dynamic response. The desired dynamic task is encoded via optimal tuning of the full-scale metamaterial geometry through an inverse-design approach powered by a custom-developed fully-differentiable simulation environment. By deploying such strategy, we design mechanical metamaterials tailored for energy focusing, energy splitting, dynamic protection, and nonlinear motion conversion. Furthermore, we illustrate that our design framework can be expanded to automatically discover reprogrammable architectures capable of switching between different dynamic tasks. For instance, we encode two strongly competing tasks -- energy focusing and dynamic protection -- within a single architecture, utilizing static pre-compression to switch between these behaviors. The discovered designs are physically realized and experimentally tested, demonstrating the robustness of the engineered tasks. All together, our approach opens an untapped avenue towards designer materials with tailored robotic-like reprogrammable functionalities.</description>

      <title>Synergy between Spin and Orbital Angular Momenta on a M\"obius Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin and orbital angular momenta are fundamental physical characteristics described by polarization and spatial degrees of freedom, respectively. Polarization is a feature of vector fields while spatial phase gradient determines the orbital angular momentum ubiquitous to any scalar field. Common wisdom treats these two degrees of freedom as distinct and independent principles to manipulate wave propagations. Here, we demonstrate their synergy. This is achieved by introducing two orthogonal $p$-orbitals as eigenbases, whose spatial modal features are exploited to generate orbital angular momenta and the associated orbital orientations provide means to simultaneously manipulate polarizations. Through periodic modulation and directional coupling, we realize a full cyclic evolution of the synchronized and synergized spin-orbital angular momenta. Remarkably, this evolution acquires a nontrivial geometric phase, leading to its representation on a M\"obius strip. Experimentally, an acoustic cavity array is designed, whose dipole resonances precisely mimic the $p$-orbitals. The acoustic waves, uniquely, see the pressure (scalar) field as a spatial feature and carry an intrinsic polarization defined by the velocity (vector) field, serving as an ideal platform to observe the synergy of spin and orbital angular momenta. Based on such a property, we further showcase a spin-orbital-Hall effect, highlighting the intricate locking of handedness, directionality, spin density and spatial mode profile. Our study unveils a fundamental connection between spin and orbital angular momenta, promising avenues for novel applications in information coding and high-capacity communications.</description>

      <title>Lithographically Defined Zerogap Strain Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal thin films on soft polymers provide a unique opportunity for resistance-based strain sensors. A mechanical mismatch between the conductive film and the flexible substrate causes cracks to open and close, changing the electrical resistance as a function of strain. However, the very randomness of the formation, shape, length, orientation, and distance between adjacent cracks limits the sensing range as well as repeatability. Herein, we present a breakthrough: the Zerogap Strain Sensor, whereby lithography eliminates randomness and violent tearing process inherent in conventional crack sensors and allows for short periodicity between gaps with gentle sidewall contacts, critical in high strain sensing enabling operation over an unprecedently wide range. Our sensor achieves a gauge factor of over 15,000 at {\epsilon}ext=18%, the highest known value. With the uniform gaps of three-to-ten thousand nanometer widths characterized by periodicity and strain, this approach has far reaching implications for future strain sensors whose range is limited only by that of the flexible substrate, with non-violent operations that always remain below the tensile limit of the metal.</description>

      <title>Intense and Stable Blue Light Emission from CsPbBr$_3$/Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ Heterostructures Embedded in Transparent Nanoporous Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are attractive for light emitting devices both as electroluminescent and color converting materials, since they combine intense and narrow emissions with good charge injection and transport properties. However, most perovskite nanocrystals shine at green and red wavelengths, the observation of intense and stable blue emission still being a challenging target. In this work, we report a method to attain intense and enduring blue emission (470-480 nm), with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 40%, originated from very small CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals (diameter&lt;3nm) formed by controllably exposing Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ to humidity. This process is mediated by the void network of a mesoporous transparent scaffold in which the zero-dimensional (0D) Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ lattice is embedded, which allows the fine control over water adsorption and condensation that determines the optimization of the synthetic procedure and, eventually, the nanocrystal size. By temperature dependent photoemission analysis of samples with different [CsPbBr$_3$]/[Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$] volume ratios, we show that the bright blue emission observed results from the efficient charge transfer to the CsPbBr$_3$ inclusions from the Cs$_4$PbBr$_6$ host. Our approach provides a means to attain highly efficient transparent blue light emitting films that complete the palette offered by perovskite nanocrystals for lighting and display applications.</description>

      <title>Stealthy and hyperuniform isotropic photonic bandgap structure in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photonic crystals the propagation of light is governed by their photonic band structure, an ensemble of propagating states grouped into bands, separated by photonic band gaps. Due to discrete symmetries in spatially strictly periodic dielectric structures their photonic band structure is intrinsically anisotropic. However, for many applications, such as manufacturing artificial structural color materials or developing photonic computing devices, but also for the fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions, it is of major interest to seek materials with long range non-periodic dielectric structures which allow the formation of {\it isotropic} photonic band gaps. Here, we report the first ever 3D isotropic photonic band gap for an optimized disordered stealthy hyperuniform structure for microwaves. The transmission spectra are directly compared to a diamond pattern and an amorphous structure with similar node density. The band structure is measured experimentally for all three microwave structures, manufactured by 3D-Laser-printing for meta-materials with refractive index up to $n=2.1$. Results agree well with finite-difference-time-domain numerical investigations and a priori calculations of the band-gap for the hyperuniform structure: the diamond structure shows gaps but being anisotropic as expected, the stealthy hyperuniform pattern shows an isotropic gap of very similar magnitude, while the amorphous structure does not show a gap at all. The centimeter scaled microwave structures may serve as prototypes for micrometer scaled structures with bandgaps in the technologically very interesting region of infrared (IR).</description>

      <title>Air-coupled ultrasound using broadband shock waves from piezoelectric spark igniters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used an optomechanical sensor to study the ultrasound generated by manually operated piezoelectric spark igniters. These low-energy sparks produce short-duration acoustic shock-wave pulses, with sub-microsecond rise times and frequency content extending well beyond 2 MHz in air. The same source-receiver combination was then used to demonstrate broadband characterization of solid (polymer and glass) plates in a simple setup, where single spark events yielded high-SNR data without the need for critical alignment. This setup also enabled us to estimate pressure excursions approaching 105 Pa at millimeter-scale distances from the spark. The results are in large part made possible by the small size, wide bandwidth, and high sensitivity of the optomechanical sensor, and might be of interest for air-coupled ultrasound applications in non-destructive testing.</description>

      <title>On the geometric phase and its role in the design of elastic topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase provides important mathematical insights to understand the occurrence and evolution of the dynamic response in a diverse spectrum of systems ranging from quantum to classical mechanics. While the concept of geometric phase, which is an additional phase factor occurring in dynamical systems, holds the same meaning across different fields of application, its use and interpretation can acquire important nuances specific to the system of interest. In recent years, the development of the concept of quantum topological materials and its extension to classical mechanical systems have renewed the interest in the study of the geometric phase. This study reviews the concept of geometric phase and discusses, by means of either established or original results, its role in the design of elastic materials. Concepts of differential geometry and topology are put forward to provide a theoretical understanding of the geometric phase and its connection to the physical properties of the system. Then, the concept of geometric phase is applied to different types of elastic waveguides to explain how either topologically trivial or non-trivial behavior can emerge based on a proper geometric design of the waveguide.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of Contextual Advantage in minimum error and maximum confidence mirror-state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextuality is well known as a vital resource for locating the boundary between classical and quantum theories, as well as identifying tasks showing quantum advantage. In a surge of recent works [Schmid and Spekkens, Phys.Rev.X 8, 011015 (2018); Mukherjee, Naonit and Pan, Phys.Rev.A 106, 012216 (2022); Flatt, Lee, Carceller, Brask and Bae, PRX QUANTUM 3, 030337 (2022)], it has also been shown that contextuality is the crucial resource in quantum state discrimination (QSD) tasks, including minimum error discrimination (MED) and maximum confidence discrimination (MCD), together with many other figure-of-merits. Despite the fundamental progress made by those aforementioned works, none of them mention about how to realize their fancy proposals, which is doubtlessly necessary for the final goal of applying this resource in real QSD tasks. In this paper, we report the first experimental demonstration of contextual advantage in both MED and MCD for three mirror-symmetric states using interferometric quantum walk, which can be easily generalized to any figure-of-merit in QSD. Our experiment agrees well with the result of theoretical simulation, and also shows the great potentiality of leveraging this method to explore a simpler version for the witness of contextuality, as well as demonstrating quanutm advantage of various tasks that require QSD.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon-phonon cavity for large-amplitude terahertz spin-wave excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spin waves or their quanta, magnons, can be efficiently excited by acoustic phonons because these excitations have similar wavevectors in the THz regime. THz acoustic phonons can be produced using photoacoustic phenomena but typically have a low population and thus a relatively low displacement amplitude. The magnetization amplitude and population of the acoustically excited THz magnons are thus usually small. Using analytical calculations and dynamical phase-field simulations, we show that a freestanding metal/magnetic-insulator (MI)/dielectric multilayer can be designed to produce large-amplitude THz spin wave via cavity-enhanced magnon-phonon interaction. The amplitude of the acoustically excited THz spin wave in the freestanding multilayer is predicted to be more than ten times larger than in a substrate-supported multilayer. Acoustically excited nonlinear magnon-magnon interaction is demonstrated in the freestanding multilayer. The simulations also indicate that the magnon modes can be detected by probing the charge current in the metal layer generated via spin-charge conversion across the MI/metal interface and the resulting THz radiation. Applications of the freestanding multilayer in THz optoelectronic transduction are computationally demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts a substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures to provide high electric and magnetic field enhancements while keeping the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are uniquely suited for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this numerical study, we propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 5-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables a 10-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we numerically show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive background-free chiral sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Sub-100-fs formation of dark excitons in monolayer WS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides are promising for electronics and optoelectronics applications owing to their properties governed by strongly-bound bright and dark excitons. Momentum-forbidden dark excitons have recently received attention as better alternatives to bright excitons for long-range transport. However, accessing the dynamics of dark excitons is challenging experimentally. The most direct, but very complicated, experiment is transient angle-resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy: sub-100-fs formation of K-$\Lambda$-excitons in monolayer WS$_2$ has been identified previously taking advantage of momentum resolution of detected signals [1]. Here, we use a simpler setting of transient photoemission electron microscopy (with spatial resolution of 75 nm), which is inherently sensitive to dark K-$\Lambda$ excitons in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenide and has exceptionally high temporal resolution of 13 fs. We are able to directly observe intervalley scattering (dark-exciton formation) in monolayer WS$_2$ with scattering rates in the range of 14-50 fs followed by picosecond-scale dynamics mediated by defects.</description>

      <title>Dielectric microwave resonator with large optical apertures for spin-based quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards a spin-based quantum microwave-optical photon transducer, we demonstrate a low-loss dielectric microwave resonator with an internal quality factor of $2.30\times10^4$ while accommodating optical apertures with a diameter of $8\, \mathrm{mm}$. The two seemingly conflicting requirements, high quality factor and large optical apertures, are satisfied thanks to the large dielectric constant of rutile ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$). The quality factor is limited by radiation loss, and we confirmed by numerical simulation that this dielectric resonator can achieve a quality factor exceeding $10^6$ by extending the height of the resonator enclosure. Using this resonator, we performed both continuous-wave (cw) and pulse electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) crystalline powder and P1 centers in a diamond crystal in a dilution refrigerator. The cw ESR spectroscopy demonstrated high-cooperativity and strong spin-resonator coupling with the DPPH and P1 centers respectively, while the pulse ESR spectroscopy successfully measured longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Microdosimetry of a clinical carbon-ion pencil beam at MedAustron -- Part 1: experimental characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08561</link>

Abstract: This paper characterizes the microdosimetric spectra of a single-energy carbon-ion pencil beam at MedAustron using a miniature solid-state silicon microdosimeter to estimate the impact of the lateral distribution of the different fragments on the microdosimetric spectra. The microdosimeter was fixed at one depth and then laterally moved away from the central beam axis in steps of approximately 2 mm. The measurements were taken in both horizontal and vertical direction in a water phantom at different depths. In a position on the distal dose fall-off beyond the Bragg peak, the frequency-mean and the dose-mean lineal energies were derived using either the entire range of y-values, or a sub-range of y values, presumingly corresponding mainly to contributions from primary particles. The measured microdosimetric spectra do not exhibit a significant change up to 4 mm away from the beam central axis. For lateral positions more than 4 mm away from the central axis, the relative contribution of the lower lineal-energy part of the spectrum increases with lateral distance due to the increased partial dose from secondary fragments. The average values yF and yD are almost constant for each partial contribution. However, when all particles are considered together, the average value of yF and yD varies with distance from the axis due to the changing dose fractions of these two components varying by 30 % and 10 % respectively up to the most off axis vertical position. Characteristic features in the microdosimetric spectra providing strong indications of the presence of helium and boron fragments have been observed downstream of the distal part of the Bragg peak. We were able to investigate the radiation quality as function of off-axis position. These measurements emphasize variation of the radiation quality within the beam and this has implications in terms of relative biological effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature.The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Button Shear Testing for Adhesion Measurements of 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05852v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered for numerous applications in microelectronics, although several challenges remain when integrating them into functional devices. Weak adhesion is one of them, caused by their chemical inertness. Quantifying the adhesion of 2D materials on three-dimensional surfaces is, therefore, an essential step toward reliable 2D device integration. To this end, button shear testing is proposed and demonstrated as a method for evaluating the adhesion of 2D materials with the examples of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten diselenide on silicon dioxide (SiO${_2}$) and silicon nitride substrates. We propose a fabrication process flow for polymer buttons on the 2D materials and establish suitable button dimensions and testing shear speeds. We show with our quantitative data that low substrate roughness and oxygen plasma treatments on the substrates before 2D material transfer result in higher shear strengths. Thermal annealing increases the adhesion of hBN on SiO${_2}$ and correlates with the thermal interface resistance between these materials. This establishes button shear testing as a reliable and repeatable method for quantifying adhesion of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Native point defects in HgCdTe infrared detector material: Identifying deep centers from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the native point defects in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) detector material Hg$_{0.75}$Cd$_{0.25}$Te using a dielectric-dependent hybrid density functional combined with spin-orbit coupling. Characterizing these point defects is essential as they are responsible for intrinsic doping and nonradiative recombination centers in the detector material. The dielectric-dependent hybrid functional allows for an accurate description of the band gap ($E_g$) for Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$Te (MCT) over the entire compositional range, a level of accuracy challenging with standard hybrid functionals. Our comprehensive examination of the native point defects confirms that cation vacancies $V_\text{Hg(Cd)}$ are the primary sources of $p$-type conductivity in the LWIR material given their low defect formation energies and the presence of a shallow acceptor level ($-$/0) near the valence-band maximum (VBM). In addition to the shallow acceptor level, the cation vacancies exhibit a deep charge transition level (2$-$/$-$) situated near the midgap, characteristic of nonradiative recombination centers. Our results indicate that Hg interstitial could also be a deep center in the LWIR MCT through a metastable configuration under the Hg-rich growth conditions. While an isolated Te antisite does not show deep levels, the formation of $V_\text{Hg}$-Te$_\text{Hg}$ defect complex introduces a deep acceptor level within the band gap.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary Optical and Transport Properties of Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Two-Phase Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) two-phase media are a special subset of hyperuniform structures with novel physical properties due to their hybrid crystal-liquid nature. We have previously shown that the strong-contrast expansion of a linear fractional form of the effective dynamic dielectric constant leads to accurate approximations for disordered two-phase composites when truncated at the two-point level for distinctly different microstructural symmetries in three dimensions. Here, we further elucidate the extraordinary optical and transport properties of disordered SHU media. Among other results, we prove in detail that SHU layered and transversely isotropic media are perfectly transparent (i.e., no Anderson localization, in principle) within finite wavenumber intervals through the third-order terms. Remarkably, the results for these SHU media imply that there can be no Anderson localization within the predicted perfect transparency interval in practice because the localization length is much larger than any practically large sample size. We further contrast and compare the extraordinary physical properties of SHU layered, transversely isotropic, and fully isotropic media to other model nonstealthy microstructures, including their attenuation characteristics, as measured by the imaginary part of effective dielectric constant, and transport properties, as measured by the time-dependent diffusion spreadability. We demonstrate cross-property relations between them: they are positively correlated as the structures span from nonhyperuniform, nonstealthy hyperuniform, and SHU media. Establishing cross-property relations for SHU media for other wave phenomena (e.g., elastodynamics) and transport properties will also be useful. Cross-property relations are generally useful because they enable one to estimate one property, given a measurement of another.</description>

Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberrations is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. The compensation rules are derived for an economical three-component double-plane symmetric system containing two cylindrical mirrors and one toroidal lens. Anamorphic systems, which provide large magnifications in the two orthogonal directions, are presented.</description>

      <title>Dynamic laser ablation loading of a linear Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed method for accumulating Ca$^{+}$ ions controllably in a linear Paul trap. The ions are generated by pulsed laser ablation and dynamically loaded into the ion trap by switching the trapping potential on and off. The loaded ions are precooled by buffer gas and then laser-cooled to form Coulomb crystals for verifying quantity. The number of ions is controlled by manipulating the trapping potential of the ion trap, partial pressure of buffer gas and turn-on time of the entrance end cap voltage. With single-pulse laser ablation, the number of trapped ions ranges from tens to ten thousand. The kinetic energy of loaded ions can be selected via the optimal turn-on time of the entrance end cap. Using multiple-pulse laser ablation, the number is further increased and reaches about $4 \times 10^{4}$. The dynamic loading method has wide application for accumulating low-yielding ions via laser ablation in the ion trap.</description>

      <title>Process signature-driven high spatio-temporal resolution alignment of multimodal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</description>
