      <title>Compact and robust optical frequency reference module based on reproducible and redistributable optical design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilized optical frequency references (OFRs) are indispensable for atom-based quantum technologies, optical communications, and precision metrology. As these systems become more sophisticated, demands for compactness, robustness, and straightforward reproduction have grown. In this work, we present a robust 19-inch rack-mountable OFR module designed via a web-based CAD workflow that allows straightforward redistribution and reproduction. Its optical subsystem, designed based on a modeled laser beam path, places optical elements with sub-millimeter accuracy on a custom-machined aluminum plate, allowing straightforward assembly without extensive alignment and providing high mechanical stability. The module maintains frequency-stable operation for several months without user intervention and exhibits high robustness to mechanical vibrations up to 4g. All design files, including mechanical and optical metadata, are openly shared for straightforward reproduction and adaptation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the optical pumping on the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2-5s8p\,{}^1P_1$ transition in a magneto-optical trap of Sr atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the efficacy of optical pumping on the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s8p\,{}^1P_1$ ($448\,\mathrm{nm}$) transition in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of Sr atoms. The number of trapped atoms is enhanced by a factor of $12.0(6)$, which is six times as large as that obtained using the pumping transition $5s4d\,{}^1D_2 - 5s6p\,{}^1P_1$ ($717\,\mathrm{nm}$). This enhancement is limited by decay pathways that bypass the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, namely $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_0$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2 \to 5s5p\,{}^3P_2$, which account for 8\% of the total loss of the trapped atoms. We determine the decay rates for the $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_1$ and $5s5p\,{}^1P_1 \to 5s4d\,{}^3D_2$ transitions to be $66(6)\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $2.4(2)\times10^2\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, respectively. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time that, when the trap beam diameter is small, escape of atoms in the $5s4d\,{}^1D_2$ state, which has a relatively long lifetime of $400\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, becomes a dominant loss mechanism, and that the $448\,\mathrm{nm}$ pumping light effectively suppresses this escape. Our findings will contribute to improved laser cooling and fluorescence imaging in cold strontium atom platforms, such as quantum computers based on optical tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Precision calculation of the bound-electron $g$ factor in molecular hydrogen ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the bound-electron $g$ factor for a wide range of rovibrational states of the molecular hydrogen ions H$_2^+$ and HD$^+$. Relativistic and QED corrections of orders up to $\alpha^5$ are taken into account. All contributions are calculated in a nonrelativistic QED framework, except for relativistic corrections of order $(Z\alpha)^4$ and above, which are obtained by calculating the relativistic $g$ factor using a precise minmax finite element solution of the two-center Dirac equation. A relative accuracy of $4-5 \times 10^{-11}$ is achieved for the scalar $g$ factor component, which represents an improvement by more than three orders of magnitude over previous calculations. These results are useful for internal state identification and rovibraional spectroscopy of single molecular hydrogen ions in Penning traps, and open a new avenue towards precision tests of QED.</description>

      <title>A Low-Power Evanescent Field Atom Guide Based on Nanofiber Testbeds for Chip-Scale Quantum Inertial Sensors with Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in cold atom interferometry have facilitated the practical application of quantum inertial sensors. To mitigate the detrimental effects of operating in dynamic environments, optical or magnetic atom guides are essential for transverse confinement. One notable approach involves the use of evanescent field (EF) optical dipole traps as atom guides (i.e. EF atom guides). In this study, we first investigated the feasibility of EF atom guides using nanofiber testbeds for application in photonic integrated circuits (PICs). We successfully demonstrated EF atom guiding with traveling evanescent waves and validated the atomic coherence of EF-guided atoms through microwave fields and fiber-guided sub-microwatt EF Doppler-free Raman beams. Our low-power EF atom guides, based on nanofiber testbeds, utilize 793 and 937 nm light to trap 133Cs atoms. This approach reduces power requirements to &lt;10mW, enabling easier thermal management in vacuum environments. These wavelengths were also selected to facilitate the integration of EF atom guides on membrane PIC platforms, which we previously demonstrated with a suspended membrane waveguide capable of handling in-vacuum optical powers suitable for EF atom guiding (Gehl et al., Opt. Express 29, 13129, 2021). Our design includes an open hole in a transparent membrane, which facilitates the loading of sub-Doppler cooled atoms using a membrane magneto-optical trap (Lee et al., Sci. Rep. 11, 8807, 2021). These developments offer a unique path for integrating EF atom guides on the PIC platforms. All these findings represent a significant first step toward EF-guided atom interferometry and the first demonstration of chip-scale quantum inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</description>

      <title>Analog phase-sensitive time-reversal of optically-carried radiofrequency signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving low-latency time-reversal of broadband radiofrequency signals is crucial for reliable communications in dynamic, uncontrolled environments. However, existing approaches are either digitally assisted -- making broadband extension challenging -- or limited to amplitude modulation. In this work, we report the very first experimental realization of a fully analog, phase-preserving time-reversal architecture for optically-carried radiofrequency signals. The method exploits the exceptional coherence properties of rare-earth ion-doped materials, and leverages the well-established photon echo mechanism, widely used in quantum technologies. While our demonstration is conducted with a modest bandwidth, we identify the fundamental cause of this limitation and propose solutions for future scalability.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>
