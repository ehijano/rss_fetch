      <title>The stacky concentration theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient criterion for the Chow or algebraic bordism groups of an algebraic stack, localized at a set of Chern classes of line bundles, to be concentrated in some closed substack. This is a vast generalization of the torus fixed-point localization theorem in equivariant intersection theory, which is the special case of the stack quotient of a scheme $X$ by an action of a torus $T$. Taking on the one hand an algebraic stack in place of $X$, we deduce a generalization of torus localization to algebraic stacks. Taking on the other hand any algebraic group $G$ instead of $T$, we obtain a localization theorem in $G$-equivariant intersection theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher dimensional geometry of Berkovich spaces using open fiber disks, which are given by open disks in a relative dimension $1$ fibration. Inspired by birational geometry, we conjecture that the Berkovich skeleton is the complement of the union of all open fiber disks, and prove this conjecture for $\mathcal{X}$ admitting a strictly semistable model with semiample canonical class.</description>

      <title>Double ramification cycles within degeneracy loci via moduli of roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Janda, Pandharipande, Pixton, and Zvonkine introduced an extremely useful method using $r$th roots for singling out fundamental classes on moduli of curves within polynomials arising from Riemann--Roch. The so-called double ramification (DR) cycles provide a natural framework embracing most of these classes. They are both fundamental in recent developments in enumerative geometry and central in algebraic geometry, because they express the loci where line bundles on a family of curves are trivial along the fibres. The aim of this paper is to show that the above $r$th root method can be regarded as a technique to remove excess intersection occurring in the presence of an unwanted subcurve which we call the parasitic curve. To this end, we reinterpret the DR cycle as a distinguished component of the degeneracy class of a map of vector bundles. When applied to moduli of $r$th roots and combined with a Riemann--Roch computation, this point of view yields a proof of the Hodge-DR Conjecture, along with new proofs of many known formulae for DR cycles and logarithmic DR cycles. Our proofs are valid in arbitrary characteristic.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations of Calabi--Yau complete intersections and metric SYZ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toric degeneration $\mathcal{X}$ of Calabi--Yau complete intersections of Batyrev--Borisov in the Gross--Siebert program. For the toric degeneration $\mathcal{X}$, we study the real Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation corresponding to the non-archimedean Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation that yields the non-archimedean Calabi--Yau metric. Our main theorem describes the real Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation in terms of tropical geometry and proves the metric SYZ conjecture for the toric degeneration $\mathcal{X}$ supposing the existence of its solution.</description>

      <title>Shafarevich-Tate groups of holomorphic Lagrangian fibrations II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact hyperk\"ahler manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi\colon X\to B$. A Shafarevich-Tate twist of $X$ is a holomorphic symplectic manifold with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi^\varphi\colon X^\varphi\to B$ which is isomorphic to $\pi$ locally over the base. In particular, $\pi^\varphi$ has the same fibers as $\pi$. A twist $X^\varphi$ corresponds to an element $\varphi$ in the Shafarevich-Tate group of $X$. We show that $X^\varphi$ is K\"ahler when a multiple of $\varphi$ lies in the connected component of unity of the Shafarevich-Tate group and give a necessary condition for $X^\varphi$ to be bimeromorphic to a K\"ahler manifold.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of rigid hypersurfaces with separable variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a polynomial F such that each variable appears in exactly one monomial. The hypersurface defined by the polynomial F is called a hypersurface with separable variables. A variety is called rigid if there are no nontrivial actions of the additive group of the ground field on it. If a variety is rigid, then it is known that in the automorphism group there exists a unique maximal torus. We describe the automorphism group of a rigid hypersurface with separable variables, in particular we show that it is a finite extension of the maximal torus.</description>

Abstract: We study deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $p$ using techniques from derived algebraic geometry. We prove a mixed characteristic analogue of the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem (which states that Calabi-Yau varieties in characteristic $0$ are unobstructed), and we show that ordinary Calabi-Yau varieties admit canonical lifts to characteristic $0$, generalising the Serre-Tate theorem on ordinary abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Toric models of smooth Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a general rational smooth Fano threefold admits a toric model. More precisely, for a general rational smooth Fano threefold $X$, we show the existence of a boundary divisor $D$ for which $(X,D)\simeq_{\rm cbir} (\mathbb{P}^3,H_0+H_1+H_2+H_3)$, where the $H_i$'s are the coordinate hyperplanes. In particular, a general rational smooth Fano threefold has birational complexity zero. We argue that the three conditions: rationality, generality, and smoothness are indeed necessary for the theorem.</description>

      <title>Simple Linear Loops: Algebraic Invariants and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic generation of loop invariants is a fundamental challenge in software verification. While this task is undecidable in general, it is decidable for certain restricted classes of programs. This work focuses on invariant generation for (branching-free) loops with a single linear update.
  Our primary contribution is a polynomial-space algorithm that computes the strongest algebraic invariant for simple linear loops, generating all polynomial equations that hold among program variables across all reachable states. The key to achieving our complexity bounds lies in mitigating the blowup associated with variable elimination and Gr\"obner basis computation, as seen in prior works. Our procedure runs in polynomial time when the number of program variables is fixed.
  We examine various applications of our results on invariant generation, focusing on invariant verification and loop synthesis. The invariant verification problem investigates whether a polynomial ideal defining an algebraic set serves as an invariant for a given linear loop. We show that this problem is coNP-complete and lies in PSPACE when the input ideal is given in dense or sparse representations, respectively. In the context of loop synthesis, we aim to construct a loop with an infinite set of reachable states that upholds a specified algebraic property as an invariant. The strong synthesis variant of this problem requires the construction of loops for which the given property is the strongest invariant. In terms of hardness, synthesising loops over integers (or rationals) is as hard as Hilbert's Tenth problem (or its analogue over the rationals). When loop constants are constrained to bit-bounded rational numbers, we demonstrate that loop synthesis and its strong variant are both decidable in PSPACE, and in NP when the number of program variables is fixed.</description>

      <title>Some results on Mattei's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present some results on the Mattei's conjecture, which asserts that the algebraic multiplicity of one-dimensional holomorphic foliations is a topological invariant. For instance, we establish a version of the A'Campo-L\^e Theorem adapted for foliations, which was originally formulated for hypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that, under certain conditions, the algebraic multiplicity equals to 1 of holomorphic one-dimensional foliations is a topological invariant. As a consequence, we prove that saddle-nodes are also topological invariant. Additionally, we address a fundamental result in the literature concerning Mattei's conjecture proved by Rosas-Bazan, which says that under the existence of a homeomorphism extending throughout a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor of the first blowing up, Mattei's conjecture has a positive answer. As a consequence of a characterization of the invariance of multiplicity proved here, we obtain that Mattei's conjecture has a positive answer if the homeomorphism extends locally in a small neighborhood where there is a separatrix not contained in the exceptional divisor of the first blowing up, but not necessarily extends throughout a neighborhood of whole exceptional divisor.</description>

      <title>Equi-affine minimal-degree moving frames for polynomial curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory and an algorithm for constructing minimal-degree polynomial moving frames for polynomial curves in an affine space. The algorithm is equivariant under volume-preserving affine transformations of the ambient space and the parameter shifts. We show that any matrix-completion algorithm can be turned into an equivariant moving frame algorithm via an equivariantization procedure that we develop. We prove that if a matrix-completion algorithm is of minimal degree then so is the resulting equivariant moving frame algorithm. We propose a novel minimal-degree matrix-completion algorithm, complementing the existing body of literature on this topic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(2, V)$ for an even-dimensional vector space $V$. Its derived category of coherent sheaves has a Lefschetz exceptional collection with respect to the Pl\"ucker embedding. We consider a variety $X_1$ of pairs consisting of a degenerate $2$-form on $V$ and a line in its kernel. Note that $X_1$ is generically a $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration over the Pfaffian variety of degenerate $2$-forms on $V$. We construct an exceptional collection of coherent sheaves on $X_1$ such that the subcategory of $D^b_{\mathrm{coh}}(X_1)$ generated by that collection is conjecturally equivalent to the homologically projectively dual category of the Grassmannian.</description>

Abstract: Every compact Riemann surface $X$ admits a natural projective structure $p_u$ as a consequence of the uniformization theorem. In this work we describe the construction of another natural projective structure on $X$, namely the Hodge projective structure $p_h$, related to the second fundamental form of the period map. We then describe how projective structures correspond to $(1,1)$-differential forms on the moduli space of projective curves and, from this correspondence, we deduce that $p_u$ and $p_h$ are not the same structure.</description>

Abstract: We present a proof of a conjecture of Q. Shi, Y. Wang and H. Zuo claiming that the maximal spectral number of a hypersurface isolated singularity does not belong to the Tjurina spectrum. This follows from the self-duality of the Jacobian ring, which is compatible with the action of $f$ and also with the $V$-filtration. We also provide a sufficient condition for the generalized Hertling conjecture on the variance of Tjurina spectrum to fail, and calculate some examples using some codes in Singular.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a finite group, and $g \geq 2$. We study the locus of genus g curves that admit a G-action of given type, and inclusions between such loci. We use this to study the locus of genus g curves with prescribed automorphism group G. We completely classify these loci for g=3 (including equations for the corresponding curves), and for $g \leq 10$ we classify those loci corresponding to "large" G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many generating series of combinatorially interesting numbers have the property that the sum of the terms of order $&lt;p$ at some suitable point is congruent to a zero of a zeta-function modulo infinitely many primes $p$. Surprisingly, very often these congruences turn out to hold modulo $p^2$ or even $p^3$. We call such congruences supercongruences and in the past 15 years an abundance of them have been discovered. In this paper we show that a large proportion of them can be explained by the use of modular functions and forms.</description>

Abstract: We study the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on a smooth Danielewski surface of the form $x y = p(z)$ with $x,y,z \in \mathbb{C}$. We provide explicitly given generators to show that: 1. The Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields is generated by $6$ complete vector fields. 2. The Lie algebra of volume-preserving polynomial vector fields is generated by finitely many vector fields, whose number depends on the degree of the defining polynomial. 3. There exists a Lie sub-algebra generated by $4$ LNDs whose flows generate a group that acts infinitely transitively on the Danielewski surface. The latter result is also generalized to higher dimensions where $z \in \mathbb{C}^N$.</description>
