      <title>Frizzle: Combining spectra or images by forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When there are many observations of an astronomical source - many images with different dithers, or many spectra taken at different barycentric velocities - it is standard practice to shift and stack the data, to (for example) make a high signal-to-noise average image or mean spectrum. Bound-saturating measurements are made by manipulating a likelihood function, where the data are treated as fixed, and model parameters are modified to fit the data. Traditional shifting and stacking of data can be converted into a model-fitting procedure, such that the data are not modified, and yet the output is the shift-adjusted mean. The key component of this conversion is a spectral model that is completely flexible but also a continuous function of wavelength (or position in the case of imaging) that can represent any signal being measured by the device after any reasonable translation (or rotation or field distortion). The benefits of a modeling approach are myriad: The sacred data never are modified. Noise maps, data gaps, and bad-data masks don't require interpolation. The output can take the form of an image or spectrum evaluated on a pixel grid, as is traditional. In addition to shifts, the model can account for line-spread or point-spread function variations, world-coordinate-system variations, and calibration or normalization variations. The noise in the output becomes uncorrelated across neighboring pixels as the shifts deliver good coverage in some sense. The only cost is a small increase in computational complexity over that of traditional methods. We demonstrate the method with a small data example and we provide open source sample code for re-use.</description>

      <title>Impact of Starlink constellation on Early LSST: a Photometric Analysis of Satellite Trails with BRDF Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a simulation and quantification of the impact of the Starlink constellation on LSST in terms of the trail surface brightness using a BRDF-based satellite photometric model. A total of 11,908 satellites from the Gen1 and Gen2A constellations are used to focus on the interference to the initial phase of LSST operation. The all-sky simulation shows that approximately 69.33% of the visible satellites over station have an apparent brightness greater than 7 mag with a v1.5 satellite model. The impact of satellite streaks exhibit a non-monotonic relationship to the solar altitude, with the worst moments occurring around $-15^{\circ}$ solar altitude. The assessment based on simulated schedules indicates that no trails can reach the saturation-level magnitude, but 71.61% trails show a surface brightness brighter than the best-case crosstalk correctable limits, and this percentage increases as the dodging weight increases. Therefore, avoiding satellites in the scheduler algorithm is an effective mitigation method, but both the number of streaks and their brightness should be taken into account simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae I. Measurements and temporal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow absorption features in nearby supernova (SN) spectra are a powerful diagnostic of the slow-moving material in the line of sight: they are extensively used to infer dust extinction from the host galaxies, and they can also serve in the detection of circumstellar material originating from the SN progenitor and present in the vicinity of the explosion. Despite their wide use, very few studies have examined the biases of the methods to characterize narrow lines, and not many statistical analyses exist. This is the first paper of a series in which we present a statistical analysis of narrow lines of SN spectra of various resolutions. We develop a robust automated methodology to measure the equivalent width (EW) and velocity of narrow absorption lines from intervening material in the line of sight of SNe, including Na I D , Ca II H&amp;K, K i and diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We carefully study systematic biases in heterogeneous spectra from the literature by simulating different signal-to-noise, spectral resolution, slit size and orientation and present the real capabilities and limitations of using low- and mid-resolution spectra to study these lines. In particular, we find that the measurement of the equivalent width of the narrow lines in low-resolution spectra is highly affected by the evolving broad P-Cygni profiles of the SN ejecta, both for core-collapse and type Ia SNe, inducing a conspicuous apparent evolution. We present thus an easy way to detect and exclude those cases to obtain more robust and reliable measurements. Finally, after considering all possible effects, we analyse the temporal evolution of the narrow features in a large sample of nearby SNe to detect any possible variation in their EWs over time. We find no time evolution of the narrow line features in our large sample for all SN types</description>

      <title>Logistic regression to boost exoplanet detection performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets requires to separate the background noise from the exoplanet signals. Statistical methods have been recently proposed to avoid subtracting any signal of interest as opposed to initial self-subtracting methods based on Angular Differential Imaging (ADI). However, unless conservative thresholds are chosen to claim for a detection, such approaches tend to produce a list of candidates that include many false positives. Choosing high, conservative, thresholds leads to miss the faintest planets. We extend a statistical framework with a logistic regression to filter the list of candidates. Features with physical/optical meaning (in two wavelengths) are used, leading to a very fast and pragmatic approach. The overall method requires a simple edge detection (image processing) and clustering algorithm to work with sub-images. To estimate its efficiency, we apply our approach to targets observed with the ESO/SPHERE high contrast imager, that were previously used as tests for blind surveys. Experimental results with injected signals show that either the number of false detections is considerably reduced or faint exoplanets that would otherwise not be detected can be sometimes found. Typically, on the blind tests performed, we are now able to detect around 50% more of the injected planets with an SNR below 5, and with a very low number of additional candidates.</description>

      <title>SOLARNET Metadata Recommendations for Solar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.12139v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior to the EU Horizon 2020 and FP7 SOLARNET projects, metadata descriptions of Solar observations were only standardized for space-based observations, but the standards have been mostly within a single space mission at a time, at times with significant differences between different mission standards. In the context of ground-based Solar observations, data has typically not been made freely available to the general research community, resulting in an even greater lack of standards for metadata descriptions. This situation makes it difficult to construct multi-instrument archives/virtual observatories with anything more than the most basic metadata available for searching, as well as making it difficult to write generic software for instrument-agnostic data analysis. This document describes the metadata recommendations developed under the SOLARNET EU project, which aims foster more collaboration and data sharing between both ground-based and space-based Solar observatories. The recommendations will be followed by data pipelines developed under the SOLARNET project as well as e.g. the Solar Orbiter SPICE pipeline and the SST CHROMIS/CRISP common pipeline. These recommendations are meant to function as a common reference to which even existing diverse data sets may be related, for ingestion into solar virtual observatories and for analysis by generic software.</description>

      <title>Quantification of propagation modes in an astronomical instrument from its radiation pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern radio astronomy, one of the key technologies is to widen the frequency coverage of an instrument. The effects of higher-order modes on an instrument associated with wider bandwidths have been reported, which may degrade observation precision. It is important to quantify the higher-order propagation modes, though their power is too small to measure directly. Instead of the direct measurement of modes, we make an attempt to deduce them based on measurable radiation patterns. Assuming a linear system, whose radiated field is determined as a superposition of the mode coefficients in an instrument, we obtain a coefficient matrix connecting the modes and the radiated field and calculate the pseudo-inverse matrix. To investigate the accuracy of the proposed method, we demonstrate two cases with numerical simulations, axially-corrugated horn case and offset Cassegrain antenna case, and the effect of random errors on the precision. Both cases showed the deduced mode coefficients with a precision of 10e-6 with respect to the maximum mode amplitude and 10e-3 degrees in phase, respectively. The calculation errors were observed when the random errors were smaller than 0.01 percent of the maximum radiated field amplitude, which was a much lower level compared with measurement precision. The demonstrated method works independently of the details of a system. The method can quantify the propagation modes inside an instrument and will be applied to most of linear components and antennas, which leads to various applications such as diagnosis of feed alignment and higher-performance feed design.</description>

      <title>First-principle event reconstruction by time-charge readouts for the Taishan Antineutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a liquid-scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure the reference reactor neutrino spectrum with sub-percent energy resolution. We use inhomogeous Poisson process and Tweedie generalized linear model (GLM) to calibrate the detector response and the charge distribution of a SiPM. We develop a pure probabilistic method using time and charge of SiPMs from first principles to reconstruct point-like events in the TAO central detector. Thanks to our precise model and the high photo-coverage and quantum efficiency of the SiPM tiles at TAO, we achieve a vertex position resolution better than 16 mm and an energy resolution of about 2% at 1 MeV, marking the world's best performance of liquid scintillator detectors. Our methodology is applicable to other experiments that utilize PMTs for time and charge readouts.</description>
