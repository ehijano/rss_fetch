      <title>Bifurcations and phase-space structures in KCN molecular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of the phase-space structures of KCN molecular system as a function of the vibrational energy using Lagrangian descriptors. For low energies, the motion is mostly regular around the absolute minimum of the potential energy surface. As the energy increases, the phase space combines regions with regular and chaotic motion, a difference that is well captured by the Lagrangian descriptors. We show that the dynamics is mostly governed by the invariant manifolds of the stretch periodic orbits located at the top of one of the energetic barriers of the system. Furthermore, we show a perfect agreement between the bifurcation theory and the differences observed in the phase-space structures as the vibrational energy is modified. The accuracy of our calculations is also assessed by explicit comparison with the invariant manifolds computed using linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nature of the Volcano Transition in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09079v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly coupled phase oscillators may synchronize into disordered patterns of collective motion. We analyze this transition in a large, fully connected Kuramoto model with symmetric but otherwise independent random interactions. Using the dynamical cavity method we reduce the dynamics to a stochastic single-oscillator problem with self-consistent correlation and response functions that we study analytically and numerically. We clarify the nature of the volcano transition and elucidate its relation to the existence of an oscillator glass phase.</description>

      <title>Communities for the Lagrangian Dynamics of the Turbulent Velocity Gradient Tensor: A Network Participation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex network analysis methods have been widely applied to nonlinear systems, but applications within fluid mechanics are relatively few. In this paper, we use a network for the Lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT), where each node is a flow state, and the probability of transitioning between states follows from a direct numerical simulation of statistically steady and isotropic turbulence. The network representation of the VGT dynamics is much more compact than the continuous, joint distribution of a set of invariants for the tensor. We focus on choosing optimal variables to discretize and classify the VGT states. To this end, we test several classifications based on topology and various properties of the background flow coherent structures. We do this using the notion of "community" or "module", namely clusters of nodes that are optimally distinct while also containing diverse nodal functions. The best classification based upon VGT invariants often adopted in the literature combines the sign of the principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and the sign of the discriminant function, $\Delta$, separating regions where the VGT eigenvalues are real and complex. We further improve this classification by including the relative magnitude of the non-normal contribution to the dynamics of the enstrophy and straining stemming from a Schur decomposition of the VGT. The traditional focus on the second VGT principal invariant, $Q$, implies consideration of the difference between the enstrophy and strain-rate magnitude without the non-normal parts. The fact that including the non-normality leads to a better VGT classification highlights the importance of unclosed and complex terms contributing to the VGT dynamics, namely the pressure Hessian and viscous terms, to which the VGT non-normality is intrinsically related.</description>
