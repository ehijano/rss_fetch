      <title>NeuroFlex: Column-Exact ANN-SNN Co-Execution Accelerator with Cost-Guided Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NeuroFlex is a column-level accelerator that co-executes artificial and spiking neural networks to minimize energy-delay product on sparse edge workloads with competitive accuracy. The design extends integer-exact QCFS ANN-SNN conversion from layers to independent columns. It unifies INT8 storage with on-the-fly spike generation using an offline cost model to assign columns to ANN or SNN cores and pack work across processing elements with deterministic runtime. Our cost-guided scheduling algorithm improves throughput by 16-19% over random mapping and lowers EDP by 57-67% versus a strong ANN-only baseline across VGG-16, ResNet-34, GoogLeNet, and BERT models. NeuroFlex also delivers up to 2.5x speedup over LoAS and 2.51x energy reduction over SparTen. These results indicate that fine-grained and integer-exact hybridization outperforms single-mode designs on energy and latency without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>FPGA-Based Real-Time Waveform Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For self-triggered readout of SiPM sum signals, a waveform classification can aid a simple threshold trigger to reliably extract calorimetric particle hit information online at an early stage and thus reduce the volume of transmitted data. Typically, the ADC data acquisition is based on FPGAs for edge data processing. In this study, we consider look-up-table-based neural-networks and address challenges of binary multi-layer neural networks' layout, footprint, performance and training. We show that these structures can be trained using a genetic algorithm and achieve the inference latency compatible with dead-time free processing online.</description>

      <title>DL101 Neural Network Outputs and Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear, sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model. This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.</description>

      <title>A Gate-Based Quantum Genetic Algorithm for Real-Valued Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced, enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution. Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms, establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.</description>

      <title>Selection of Filters for Photonic Crystal Spectrometer Using Domain-Aware Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the critical challenge of optimal filter selection for a novel trace gas measurement device. This device uses photonic crystal filters to retrieve trace gas concentrations affected by photon and read noise. The filter selection directly influences the accuracy and precision of the gas retrieval and, therefore, is a crucial performance driver. We formulate the problem as a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem and develop a simulator modeling gas retrieval with noise. Metaheuristics representing various families of optimizers are used to minimize the retrieval error objective function. We improve the top-performing algorithms using our novel distance-driven extensions, which employ metrics on the space of filter selections. This leads to a new adaptation of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA), called the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm Unified by Probabilistic Logic Sampling driven by Distance (UMDA-U-PLS-Dist), equipped with one of the proposed distance metrics as the most efficient and robust solver among the considered ones. We apply this algorithm to obtain a diverse set of high-performing solutions and analyze them to draw general conclusions about better combinations of transmission profiles. The analysis reveals that filters with large local differences in transmission improve the device performance. Moreover, the obtained top-performing solutions show significant improvement compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>P1-KAN: an effective Kolmogorov-Arnold network with application to hydraulic valley optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimensions. We provide error bounds for this approximation, assuming that the Kolmogorov-Arnold expansion functions are sufficiently smooth. When the function is only continuous, we also provide universal approximation theorems. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. We also compare it with several proposed KAN networks: it outperforms all networks for irregular functions and achieves similar accuracy to the original spline-based KAN network for smooth functions. Finally, we compare some of the KAN networks in optimizing a French hydraulic valley.</description>

      <title>Neural Attention: A Novel Mechanism for Enhanced Expressive Power in Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models typically calculate attention matrices using dot products, which have limitations when capturing nonlinear relationships between embedding vectors. We propose Neural Attention, a technique that replaces dot products with feed-forward networks, enabling a more expressive representation of relationships between tokens. This approach modifies only the attention matrix calculation while preserving the matrix dimensions, making it easily adaptable to existing transformer-based architectures. We provide a detailed mathematical justification for why Neural Attention increases representational capacity and conduct controlled experiments to validate this claim. When comparing Neural Attention and Dot-Product Attention, NLP experiments on WikiText-103 show a reduction in perplexity of over 2 percent. Similarly, experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show improvements in accuracy of more than 4 percentage points for image classification tasks. While Neural Attention introduces higher computational demands, we develop techniques to mitigate these challenges, ensuring practical usability without sacrificing the increased expressivity it provides. This work establishes Neural Attention as an effective means of enhancing the predictive capabilities of transformer models across a variety of applications. The code for all experiments is available at https://github.com/awayfromzel/neural-attention-research.</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>
