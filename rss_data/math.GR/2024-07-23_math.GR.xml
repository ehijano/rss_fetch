      <title>A group-theoretic condition equivalent to a condition on principal blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a group-theoretic condition which is equivalent to the fact that the trivial character is the only complex irreducible character of a finite group G which is contained in the principal p-block for each prime p in a specified set of prime divisors of the order of G. This character-theoretic condition has been studied previously by a number of authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we introduce the notion of (left, right) $\pi$-$t$-simple, right $\pi$-inverse ordered semigroups and discuss characterizations and relationships concerning them. Semilattice decomposition of left $\pi$-$t$-simple ordered semigroups has been given here. Furthermore, we study an interrelation between the generalized Green's relations and the class of semigroups which are semilattices of right $\pi$-$t$-simple ordered semigroups.</description>

Abstract: We study the finite basis problem for 4-element additively idempotent semirings whose additive reducts are semilattices of height 1. Up to isomorphism, there are 58 such algebras. We show that 49 of them are finitely based and the remaining ones are nonfinitely based.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that an RGD-system over $\mathbb{F}_2$ with prescribed commutation relations exists if and only if the commutation relations are Weyl-invariant and can be realized in the group $U_+$. This result gives us a machinery to produce new examples of RGD-systems with complicated commutation relations. We also discuss some applications of this result.</description>

Abstract: Commutator blueprints can be seen as blueprints for constructing RGD-systems over $\mathbb{F}_2$ with prescribed commutation relations. In this paper we construct several families of Weyl-invariant commutator blueprints, mostly of universal type. Together with the main result of \cite{BiRGD} we obtain new examples of exotic RGD-systems of universal type over $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>Mating parabolic rational maps with Hecke groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any degree $d$ rational map having a parabolic fixed point of multiplier $1$ with a fully invariant and simply connected immediate basin of attraction is mateable with the Hecke group $H_{d+1}$, with the mating realized by an algebraic correspondence. This solves the parabolic version of the Bullett-Freiberger Conjecture from 2003 on mateability between rational maps and Hecke groups. The proof is in two steps. The first is the construction of a pinched polynomial-like map which is a mating between a parabolic rational map and a parabolic circle map associated to the Hecke group. The second is lifting this pinched polynomial-like map to an algebraic correspondence via a suitable branched covering.</description>

This algorithm simultaneously uses two cryptographic procedures: encryption using a generalization of the Markovski algorithm [2] and encryption using a system of orthogonal operations. In this paper, we present an implementation of this algorithm based on T-quasigroups, more precisely, based on medial quasigroups.</description>

      <title>Complementation in Continuous Cohomology with Coefficients in Banach Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of weakly uniquely stationary representations. This framework enables us to investigate the complementability of closed subspaces within the context of continuous cohomology with coeffcients in Banach modules. As an application, we extend and refine several cohomological results from the literature, particularly in the settings of nilpotent groups, products of groups, and lattices.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Elnitsky constructed three elegant bijections between classes of reduced words for Type $\mathrm{A}$, $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ families of Coxeter groups and certain tilings of polygons. This paper offers a particular generalization of this concept to all finite Coxeter Groups in terms of embeddings into the Symmetric Group.

      <description>arXiv:2202.04060v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study deterministic and randomized streaming algorithms for word problems of finitely generated groups. For finitely generated linear groups, metabelian groups and free solvable groups we show the existence of randomized streaming algorithms with logarithmic space complexity for their word problems. We also show that the class of finitely generated groups with a logspace randomized streaming algorithm for the word problem is closed under several group theoretical constructions: finite extensions, graph products and wreath products by free abelian groups. We contrast these results with several lower bound. An example of a finitely presented group, where the word problem has only a linear space randomized streaming algorithm, is Thompson's group $F$. Finally, randomized streaming algorithms for subgroup membership problems in free groups and direct products of free groups are studied.</description>

      <title>The Kervaire conjecture and the minimal complexity of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kervaire conjecture asserts that adding a generator and then a relator to a nontrivial group always results in a nontrivial group. We introduce new methods from stable commutator length to study this type of problems about nontriviality of one-relator quotients. Roughly, we show that surfaces in certain HNN extensions bounding a given word have complexity no less than the complexity of its boundary. A consequence of this is a Freiheitssatz theorem for HNN extensions, which in particular implies and gives a new proof of Klyachko's theorem that confirms the Kervaire conjecture for torsion-free groups. As another application, we also generalize the following theorem of Klyachko-Lurye to HNN extensions: For any group $G$ and the quotient $Q$ of $G\star\mathbb{Z}$ by any proper power $w^m$ with $w\in G\star\mathbb{Z}$ projecting to $1\in\mathbb{Z}$, the natural map $G\to Q$ is injective.</description>

      <title>Haagerup property and group-invariant percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ be the Cayley graph of a finitely generated, infinite group $\Gamma$. We show that $\Gamma$ has the Haagerup property if and only if for every $\alpha&lt;1$, there is a $\Gamma$-invariant bond percolation $\mathbb P$ on $\mathcal G$ with $\mathbb E[\mathrm{deg}_{\omega}(g)]&gt;\alpha\mathrm{deg}_{\mathcal G}(g)$ for every vertex $g$ and with the two-point function $\tau(g,h)=\mathbb P\big[g\leftrightarrow h\big]$ vanishing as $d(g,h)\to\infty$. On the other hand, we show that $\Gamma$ has Kazhdan's property (T) if and only if there exists a threshold $\alpha^*&lt;1$ such that for every $\Gamma$-invariant bond percolation $\mathbb P$ on $\mathcal G$, $\mathbb E[\mathrm{deg}_\omega(o)]&gt;\alpha^*\mathrm{deg}(o)$ implies that the two-point function is uniformly bounded away from zero. These results in particular answer questions raised by Lyons (J. Math. Phys. 41. 1099-1126 (2000)) about characterizations of properties of groups beyond amenability through group-invariant percolations.
  The method of proof is new and is based on a construction of percolations with suitable dependence structures built from invariant point processes on spaces with measured walls. This construction furthermore leads to quantitative bounds on the two-point functions, exhibiting in particular exponential decay of the two-point function in several prominent examples of Haagerup groups, including co-compact Fuchsian groups, co-compact discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{Isom}(\mathbb H^n)$ and lamplighters over free groups. This method also allows us to extend the aforementioned characterization of property (T) to the setting of relative property (T) and provide an application to Bernoulli percolation at the uniqueness threshold.</description>

      <title>Uniform exponential growth for groups with proper product actions on hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the locally uniform exponential growth and product set growth for a finitely generated group $G$ acting properly on a finite product of hyperbolic spaces. Under the assumption of coarsely dense orbits or shadowing property on factors, we prove that any finitely generated non-virtually abelian subgroup has uniform exponential growth. These assumptions are fulfilled in many hierarchically hyperbolic groups, including mapping class groups, specially cubulated groups and BMW groups.
  Moreover, if $G$ acts weakly acylindrically on each factor, we show that, with two exceptional classes of subgroups, $G$ has uniform product set growth. As corollaries, this gives a complete classification of subgroups with product set growth for any group acting discretely on a simply connected manifold with pinched negative curvature, for groups acting acylindrically on trees, and for 3-manifold groups.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>The Bruhat Order of a Finite Coxeter Group and Elnitsky Tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $W$ is a finite Coxeter group and $W_J$ a standard parabolic subgroup of $W$. The main result proved here is that for any for any $w \in W$ and reduced expression of $w$ there is an Elnitsky tiling of a $2m$-polygon, where $m = [W : W_J]$. The proof is constructive and draws together the work on E-embedding in \cite{nicolaidesrowley1} and the deletion order in \cite{nicolaidesrowley3}. Computer programs which produce such tilings may be downloaded from \cite{github} and here we also present examples of the tilings for, among other Coxeter groups, the exceptional Coxeter group $\mathrm{E}_8$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10636v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a closed oriented manifold or more generally a group homology class, we introduce the spherical Plateau problem, which is a variational problem corresponding to a topological invariant called the spherical volume. In principle, its solutions should be realized by minimal surfaces in quotients of spheres. We explain that in many geometrically interesting cases, those solutions are essentially unique. We start with a review of the Ambrosio-Kirchheim theory of metric currents, and the barycenter map method developed by Besson-Courtois-Gallot. Then, we outline the following applications: (1) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for negatively curved, locally symmetric, closed oriented manifolds, (2) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for all 3-dimensional closed oriented manifolds, (3) the construction of higher-dimensional analogues of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. We also propose some open questions.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group. Given any sequence $(f_n)_{n\geq 1}$ of $\ell^p$-normalized functions ($p\in [1,2)$), consider the associated positive definite matrix coefficients $\langle f_n, \rho(\cdot) f_n\rangle$ of the right regular representation $\rho$. We construct an orthogonal decomposition of the corresponding {\it Schur multipliers} on the reduced group $C^*$-algebra or the uniform Roe algebra of $\Gamma$. We identify this decomposition explicitly via the limit points of the orbits $(\widetilde f_n)_{n\geq 1}$ in the group-invariant compactification of the quotient space constructed by Varadhan and the first author in [14]. We apply this result and use positive-definiteness to provide two (quite different) characterizations of amenability of $\Gamma$ -- one via a variational approach and the other using group-invariant percolation on Cayley graphs constructed by Benjamini, Lyons, Peres and Schramm [1]. These results underline, from a new point of view to the best of our knowledge, the manner in which Schur multipliers capture geometric properties of the underlying group $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>The rack congruence condition and half congruences in racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Racks and quandles are algebraic structures with a single binary operation that is right self-distributive and right invertible, and additionally idempotent in the case of quandles. The invertibility condition is equivalent to the existence of a second binary operation that acts as a right inverse to the first, so that racks and quandles may also be viewed as algebraic structures with a pair of (dependent) binary operations.
  When forming a quotient rack or quandle it is necessary to take this two-operation view, and define a congruence as an equivalence relation on the rack or quandle that respects both operations. However, in defining a congruence some authors have omitted the condition on the inverse operation, and defined a congruence as an equivalence relation respecting the primary operation only. We show that while respecting the primary operation is sufficient in the case of finite racks and quandles, it is not in general sufficient in the infinite case. We do this by constructing explicit examples of "half congruences": equivalence relations that respect exactly one of the two operations.
  Our work also allows us to completely characterise congruences in connected Alexander quandles.</description>

      <title>Coincidences of Division Fields of an elliptic curve defined over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the absolute Galois group acts on the group of torsion points of the elliptic curve, giving rise to a Galois representation in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\hat{\mathbb{Z}})$. The obstructions to the surjectivity of this representation are either local (i.e. at a prime), or due to nonsurjectivity on the product of local Galois images. In this article, we study an extreme case: the coincidence i.e. the equality of $n$-division fields, generated by the $n$-torsion points, attached to different positive integers $n$. We give necessary conditions for coincidences, dealing separately with vertical coincidences, at a given prime, and horizontal coincidences, across multiple primes, in particular when the Galois group on the $n$-torsion contains the special linear group. We also give a non-trivial construction for coincidences not occurring over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>
