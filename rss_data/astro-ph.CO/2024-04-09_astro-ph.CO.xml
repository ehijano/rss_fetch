      <title>Deep Learning the Intergalactic Medium using Lyman-alpha Forest at $ 4 \leq z \leq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling the thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at $4 \leq z \leq 5$ holds the potential to reveal early onset HeII reionization or lingering thermal fluctuations from HI reionization. We set out to reconstruct the IGM gas properties along simulated Lyman-alpha forest data on pixel-by-pixel basis, employing deep Bayesian neural networks. Our approach leverages the Sherwood-Relics simulation suite, consisting of diverse thermal histories, to generate mock spectra. Our convolutional and residual networks with likelihood metric predicts the Ly$\alpha$ optical depth-weighted density or temperature for each pixel in the Ly$\alpha$ forest skewer. We find that our network can successfully reproduce IGM conditions with high fidelity across range of instrumental signal-to-noise. These predictions are subsequently translated into the temperature-density plane, facilitating the derivation of reliable constraints on thermal parameters. This allows us to estimate temperature at mean cosmic density, $T_{\rm 0}$ with one sigma confidence $\delta T_{\rm 0} \sim 1000{\rm K}$ using only one $20$Mpc/h sightline ($\Delta z\simeq 0.04$) with a typical reionization history. Existing studies utilize redshift pathlength comparable to $\Delta z\simeq 4$ for similar constraints. We can also provide more stringent constraints on the slope ($1\sigma$ confidence interval $\delta {\rm \gamma} \lesssim 0.1$) of the IGM temperature-density relation as compared to other traditional approaches. We test the reconstruction on a single high signal-to-noise observed spectrum ($20$ Mpc/h segment), and recover thermal parameters consistent with current measurements. This machine learning approach has the potential to provide accurate yet robust measurements of IGM thermal history at the redshifts in question.</description>

      <title>Relativistic imprints on dispersion measure space distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional clustering of sources emitting electromagnetic pulses traveling through cold electron plasma, whose radial distance is inferred from their dispersion measure. As a distance indicator, dispersion measure is systematically affected by inhomogeneities in the electron density along the line of sight and special and general relativistic effects, similar to the case of redshift surveys. We present analytic expressions for the correlation function of fast radio bursts (FRBs), and for the galaxy-FRB cross-correlation function, in the presence of these dispersion measure-space distortions. We find that the even multipoles of these correlations are primarily dominated by non-local contributions (e.g. the electron density fluctuations integrated along the line of sight), while the dipole also receives a significant contribution from the Doppler effect, one of the major relativistic effects. A large number of FRBs, $\mathcal{O}(10^{5}\sim10^{6})$, expected to be observed in the Square Kilometre Array, would be enough to measure the even multipoles at very high significance, ${\rm S}/{\rm N} \approx 100$, and perhaps to make a first detection of the dipole (${\rm S}/{\rm N} \approx 10$) in the FRB correlation function and FRB-galaxy cross correlation function. This measurement could open a new window to study and test cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing combined with the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect: A study of baryonic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting precise cosmology from weak lensing surveys requires modelling the non-linear matter power spectrum, which is suppressed at small scales due to baryonic feedback processes. However, hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations make widely varying predictions for the amplitude and extent of this effect. We use measurements of Dark Energy Survey Year 3 weak lensing (WL) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR5 kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical baryonic feedback parameters using a flexible analytical model, `baryonification'. First, using WL only, we compare the $S_8$ constraints using baryonification to a simulation-calibrated halo model, a simulation-based emulator model and the approach of discarding WL measurements on small angular scales. We find that model flexibility can shift the value of $S_8$ and degrade the uncertainty. The kSZ provides additional constraints on the astrophysical parameters and shifts $S_8$ to $S_8=0.823^{+0.019}_{-0.020}$, a higher value than attained using the WL-only analysis. We measure the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum using WL + kSZ and constrain a mean feedback scenario that is more extreme than the predictions from most hydrodynamical simulations. We constrain the baryon fractions and the gas mass fractions and find them to be generally lower than inferred from X-ray observations and simulation predictions. We conclude that the WL + kSZ measurements provide a new and complementary benchmark for building a coherent picture of the impact of gas around galaxies across observations.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianities in primordial black hole formation and induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating primordial black holes (PBHs) is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function with such non-Gaussianities. I also show non-Gaussianity only has mild effects on the induced gravitational waves (GWs), which gives robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Redshift drift in a universe with structure III: Numerical relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic redshift drift - the change in redshift of a source over time - will enable independent detection of cosmological expansion thanks to the immense precision soon reached by new facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array Observatory and the Extremely Large Telescope. We conduct the first ever redshift drift computation in fully relativistic cosmological simulations, with the simulations performed with the Einstein Toolkit. We compute the redshift drift over the full skies of 50 synthetic observers in the simulation. We compare all-sky averages for each observer - and across all observers - to the Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) model which represents the large-scale spatially-averaged spacetime of the simulation. We find that at $z\approx0.2$ the mean redshift drift across the sky for all observers deviates from the EdS prediction at the percent level, reducing to $\sim0.1\%$ by $z\approx 1$. However, fluctuations in the redshift drift across the sky are $\sim 10-30\%$ at $z\approx 0.1$ and a few percent at $z\approx 0.5$. Such fluctuations are large enough to potentially exceed the expected precision of upcoming redshift drift measurements. Additionally, we find that along 0.48% of the light rays the redshift drift becomes temporarily positive at very low redshift of $z\lesssim 0.02$. This occurs despite our simulation data being based on a matter-dominated model universe. By including a cosmological constant, we expect a slower growth of structures than in the leading-order EdS space-time, and this may reduce the anisotropy over the observers' skies, although we generally expect our results to hold as order-of-magnitude estimates. Redshift drift is arguably one of the most important measurements to be made by next-generation telescopes. Our results collectively serve as preparation for interpreting such a measurement in the presence of realistic cosmic structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods to extract key dark energy information from cosmic distance measurements including the BAO scales and supernovae luminosity distances. Demonstrated using simulated datasets of the complete DESI, LSST and Roman surveys designed for BAO and SNe distance measurements, we show that using our method, the dynamical behaviour of the energy, pressure, equation of state (with its time derivative) of dark energy and the cosmic deceleration function can all be accurately recovered from high-quality data, which allows for robust diagnostic tests for dark energy models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extract key information of dark energy from current observations of BAO, OHD and $H_0$, and find hints of dynamical behaviour of dark energy. In particular, a dynamical dark energy model whose equation of state crosses $-1$ is favoured by observations. We also find that the Universe has started accelerating at a lower redshift than expected.</description>

      <title>Reconciling $S_8$: Insights from Interacting Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter (CDM) in alleviating the $S_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS), and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets, the constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. In addition, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the CPL and JBP models perform the best in relaxing the $S_8$ tension to $&lt;1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom dark energy from latest data. We further do an investigation of the role of RSD datasets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a value of $\sigma_{8,0}$ relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check if further extensions of this scenario, like the inclusion of the sound speed of dark energy and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false-vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false-vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false-vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false-vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic rotation curves have been served as indispensable tools for determining the distribution of mass within galaxies. Despite several advances in precision observations, some discrepancies still persist between the inferred matter distribution from luminosity and observed rotation velocities, often attributed to the presence of dark matter. Traditional parametric models, while insightful, struggle with the complexity of galaxies with prominent bulges or non-circular motions, but in contrast, non-parametric methods offer a promising alternative, adapting to the intricate nature of rotation curves without any prior assumptions. In this work, we employ artificial neural networks to reconstruct rotation curves of 17 spiral galaxies from high-quality data, demonstrating the efficacy of the non-parametric approaches in characterizing galactic dynamics. Our findings underscore the importance of employing diverse methodological approaches to comprehensively understand galactic dynamics in modern astrophysics research. Moreover, the non-parametric reconstruction approach with neural networks presents a promising avenue for further investigations, capable of generating interpolations based on the intrinsic patterns of the data.</description>

      <title>A robust test of general relativity at the galactic scales by combining strong lensing systems and gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the parametrized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ is a robust test of general relativity (GR). In some modified theories of gravity, $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ may evolve with the redshift and deviate from one at high redshifts. This means that precise constraints on $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ acquired in the solar system experiments could not be sufficient to test such theories and it is necessary to constrain $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$with high precision at high redshifts. However, in many approaches aimed at extragalactic tests of GR, the results might be biased due to entanglement of various factors, such as cosmic curvature, cosmic opacity, and the Hubble constant. Strong lensing systems naturally provide a laboratory to test $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ at galactic scales and high redshifts, but there is degeneracy between measured strength of gravity and cosmic distances in the lensing system. Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star mergers (standard sirens) provide a direct way to break this degeneracy by providing self-calibrated measurements of the luminosity distance. {We investigate the possibility of estimating $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ by combining well measured strongly lensed systems with GW signals from coalescing neutron stars. Such combination provides a cosmological-model independent, relatively pure and unbiased method for the inference of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter, avoiding the influence of the above factors and the mass-sheet degeneracy in the lens.} Based on the simulated future 55 lensed quasar systems we demonstrated that the precision of $\gamma_{\rm{PPN}}$ parameter obtained by our method could be of order of $\sim 10^{-2}$. One may reasonably expect that our approach will play an increasingly important role in precise testing the validity of general relativity at galactic scales and high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Thermal axion production at hard and soft momenta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot axions, thermally produced in the Early Universe, would contribute to dark radiation and are thus subject to present and future constraints from $N_{\rm eff}$. In this paper we quantify the contribution to $N_{\rm eff}$ and its uncertainty in models with axion-gluon couplings from thermal dynamics above the QCD transition. In more detail, we determine the leading-order thermal axion production rate for axion momenta of the order of the temperature adopting three different schemes for the incorporation of the collective dynamics of soft gluons. We show how these three schemes extrapolate differently into the regime of softer axion production, thus giving us a quantitative handle on the theory uncertainty of the rate. Upon solving the Boltzmann equation, we find that this theory uncertainty translates to an uncertainty of at most 0.002 for $N_{\rm eff}$. The uncertainty from common momentum-averaged approximations to the Boltzmann equation is smaller. We also comment on existing rate determinations in the literature and discuss how QCD transition dynamics would need to be integrated into our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete canonical formulation of general covariance makes it possible to construct new modified theories of gravity that are not of higher-curvature form, as shown here in a spherically symmetric setting. The usual uniqueness theorems are evaded by using a crucial and novel ingredient, allowing for fundamental fields of gravity distinct from an emergent space-time metric that provides a geometrical structure to all solutions. As specific examples, there are new expansion-shear couplings in cosmological models, a form of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can appear in a space-time covariant theory without introducing extra fields, and related effects help to make effective models of canonical quantum gravity fully consistent with general covariance.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Extracting high-order cosmological information in galaxy surveys with power spectra</title>

Abstract: The reconstruction method was proposed more than a decade ago to boost the signal of baryonic acoustic oscillations measured in galaxy redshift surveys, which is one of key probes for dark energy. After moving the observed overdensities in galaxy surveys back to their initial position, the reconstructed density field is closer to a linear Gaussian field, with higher-order information moved back into the power spectrum. We find that by jointly analysing power spectra measured from the pre- and post-reconstructed galaxy samples, higher-order information beyond the $2$-point power spectrum can be efficiently extracted, which generally yields an information gain upon the analysis using the pre- or post-reconstructed galaxy sample alone. This opens a window to easily use higher-order information when constraining cosmological models.</description>

      <title>21cm Intensity Mapping cross-correlation with galaxy surveys: current and forecasted cosmological parameters estimation for the SKAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of forecasts for the cross-correlation signal between 21cm intensity mapping and galaxy redshift surveys. We focus on the data sets that will be provided by the SKAO for the 21cm signal, DESI and Euclid for galaxy clustering. We build a likelihood which takes into account the effect of the beam for the radio observations, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, a simple parameterization of astrophysical nuisances, and fully exploit the tomographic power of such observations in the range $z=0.7-1.8$ at linear and mildly non-linear scales ($k&lt;0.25 h/$Mpc). The forecasted constraints, obtained with Monte Carlo Markov Chains techniques in a Bayesian framework, in terms of the six base parameters of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, are promising. The predicted signal-to-noise ratio for the cross-correlation can reach $\sim 50$ for $z\sim 1$ and $k\sim 0.1 h/$ Mpc. When the cross-correlation signal is combined with current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck, the error bar on $\Omega_{\rm c}\,h^2$ and $H_0$ is reduced by a factor 3 and 6, respectively, compared to CMB only data, due to the measurement of matter clustering provided by the two observables. The cross-correlation signal has a constraining power that is comparable to the auto-correlation one and combining all the clustering measurements a sub-percent error bar of 0.33% on $H_0$ can be achieved, which is about a factor 2 better than CMB only measurement. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we test the full pipeline on the real data measured by the MeerKat collaboration (Cunnington et al. 2022) presenting some (weak) constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing light relics through cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the prospects of upcoming 21-cm surveys of cosmic dawn ($12\lesssim \!z\lesssim\!30$) to provide cosmological information on top of upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure surveys, such as CMB-S4, Simons Observatory (SO) and DESI. We focus on the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$ which is a promising observable for probing beyond the Standard Model theories. We show including upcoming 21-cm surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) can allow probing a wide range of models for light particles at $2\sigma$ level achieving $2\sigma(N_{\rm eff})=0.034$ with CMB-S4, for example. Taking into account the degeneracy between $N_{\rm eff}$ and primordial helium fraction $Y_p$, one can achieve improvements in sensitivities to cosmological parameters, in particular, by more than a factor of 2 for $N_{\rm eff}$ and dark matter fractional energy density $\omega_c$.</description>

      <title>Temperature measurements with the relativistic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At temperatures above ~5 keV, the non-relativistic approximation used to derive the classical thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect spectrum begins to fail. When relativistic effects are included, the spectrum becomes temperature-dependent. This leads to both a problem and an opportunity: a problem, because when the temperature dependence is not accounted for the Compton-y estimate is biased; and an opportunity, because it represents a new way to measure the temperature of the intracluster medium independently of X-ray observations. This work presents current results from investigating the impact of relativistic effects on Planck cluster observations, and projections for future measurements of cluster temperatures using the Atacama Large Aperture Sub-millimetre Telescope.</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in the current cosmological data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many previous studies have explored models of dynamically interacting dark energy scenarios instead of a cosmological constant and cold dark matter. This work aims to offer a comprehensive investigation of the Yukawa-type interaction between dark energy and dark matter where dark matter mass is also a function of a dynamical scalar field value. Unlike previous work, instead of taking an approximate solution, we numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the intricate interplay between these two components of the dark sector along with the corresponding perturbations, using a suitable shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions. We have conducted a thorough analysis of this interaction using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating diverse datasets such as Planck, BAO, Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our results, for the first time, reveal a discernible detection of the coupling constant, which encapsulates the strength of the dark sector interaction. We find non-zero $\beta$ values of 0.0487, 0.0680, 0.0712, and 0.0822 ($68\%$ Confidence Limit) corresponding to the inclusion of each dataset, respectively. Notably, the addition of SH$_0$ES data led to a significant increase in the prominence of $\beta$, suggesting the potential for new physics in the dark sector. This study serves as a strategic road map for future endeavours with non-linear cosmology, which will contribute to an enhanced understanding and refinement of constraints on the dark sector interaction.</description>

      <title>Characterization of contaminants in the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation with DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations can be measured with sub-percent precision above redshift two with the Lyman-alpha forest auto-correlation and its cross-correlation with quasar positions. This is one of the key goals of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) which started its main survey in May 2021. We present in this paper a study of the contaminants to the lyman-alpha forest which are mainly caused by correlated signals introduced by the spectroscopic data processing pipeline as well as astrophysical contaminants due to foreground absorption in the intergalactic medium. Notably, an excess signal caused by the sky background subtraction noise is present in the lyman-alpha auto-correlation in the first line-of-sight separation bin. We use synthetic data to isolate this contribution, we also characterize the effect of spectro-photometric calibration noise, and propose a simple model to account for both effects in the analysis of the lyman-alpha forest. We then measure the auto-correlation of the quasar flux transmission fraction of low redshift quasars, where there is no lyman-alpha forest absorption but only its contaminants. We demonstrate that we can interpret the data with a two-component model: data processing noise and triply ionized Silicon and Carbon auto-correlations. This result can be used to improve the modeling of the lyman-alpha auto-correlation function measured with DESI.</description>

      <title>Generating Galaxy Clusters Mass Density Maps from Mock Multiview Images via Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are composed of dark matter, gas and stars. Their dark matter component, which amounts to around 80\% of the total mass, cannot be directly observed but traced by the distribution of diffused gas and galaxy members. In this work, we aim to infer the cluster's projected total mass distribution from mock observational data, i.e. stars, Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and X-ray, by training deep learning models. To this end, we have created a multiview images dataset from {\sc{The Three Hundred}} simulation that is optimal for training Machine Learning models. We further study deep learning architectures based on the U-Net to account for single-input and multi-input models. We show that the predicted mass distribution agrees well with the true one.</description>

      <title>Gravitoelectromagnetic quadrirefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective approach for the study of the interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves (EMWs), showing that quadrirefringence can be produced, a phenomenon consisting in a frequency and polarization dependency of the speed of the different polarizations of GWs and EMWs, which is also inducing a frequency and polarization dependent modification of the GW-EMW luminosity distance ratio. Quadrirefringence can be due to the GW-EMW interaction in the source or during the propagation from the source to the observer. In the first case the astrophysical properties of the source can induce a unique characteristic imprint on GWs and EMWs for each source, the rainbow of binaries, while the effect on the propagation from the source could be used to probe the large scale electromagnetic field using GWs. Numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations can be used to obtain precise theoretical predictions for different binary systems with large electromagnetic and gravitational fields, such as binary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>New Consistency Relations between Averages and Variances of Weakly Lensed Signals of Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) occurs when GWs experience local gravitational potential. In the weak lensing regime, it has been reported that a simple consistency relation holds between the variances of the magnification and phase modulation. In this paper, we present two additional consistency relations between the averages and variances of the weakly lensed GW signals in wave optics. We demonstrate that these consistency relations are derived as the weak lensing limit of the full-order relations for the averages of the amplification factor and its absolute square. These full-order relations appear to originate from energy conservation and the Shapiro time delay, and they are demonstrated to hold irrespective of the matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Radial acceleration relation of galaxies with joint kinematic and weak-lensing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine kinematic and gravitational lensing data to construct the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) of galaxies over a large dynamic range. We improve on previous weak-lensing studies in two ways. First, we compute stellar masses using the same stellar population model as for the kinematic data. Second, we introduce a new method for converting excess surface density profiles to radial accelerations. This method is based on a new deprojection formula which is exact, computationally efficient, and gives smaller systematic uncertainties than previous methods. We find that the RAR inferred from weak-lensing data smoothly continues that inferred from kinematic data by about $2.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ in acceleration. Contrary to previous studies, we find that early- and late-type galaxies lie on the same joint RAR when a sufficiently strict isolation criterion is adopted and their stellar and gas masses are estimated consistently with the kinematic RAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ version of the light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry provides a UV completion by naturally accommodating three right handed neutrinos from anomaly cancellation requirements which, in combination with the left handed neutrinos, form the sub-eV Dirac neutrinos after electroweak symmetry breaking. The particle content and the gauge charges are chosen in such a way that light neutrinos remain purely Dirac and dark matter, a gauge singlet Dirac fermion, remain stable. We consider both thermal and non-thermal production possibilities of dark matter and correlate the corresponding parameter space with the one within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments sensitive to enhanced relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. The interplay of dark matter, CMB, structure formation and other terrestrial constraints keep the scenario very predictive leading the $U(1)_{B-L}$ parameter space into tight corners.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from High-Redshift Active Galactic Nuclei in the JADES and CEERS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent calculations indicate that radio emission from quasars at $z \sim$ 6 - 7 could be detected at much earlier stages of evolution, at $z \sim$ 14 - 15, by the Next-Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). However, the {\em James Webb Space Telescope} has now discovered less luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at $z &gt;$ 4 and a few massive black holes (BHs) at $z &gt;$ 10, which may be the progenitors of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) but at different stages of growth. Radio detections of these new AGNs would provide complementary measures of their properties and those of their host galaxies. Here we estimate radio flux densities for 19 new AGNs found by the JADES, CEERS and UNCOVER surveys. We find that ngVLA should be able to detect most of these sources in targeted surveys with integration times of 10 - 100 hr (and in just 1 hr for a few of them) but most would require at least 100 hr of SKA time in spite of its greater sensitivities at low frequencies. In some cases, radio emission from the BH can be distinguished from that of H II regions and supernovae in their host galaxies, which could be used to estimate their star formation rates. Such detections would be yet another example of the useful synergies between near infrared and radio telescopes in SMBH science in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Selecting energy-momentum trace dependent gravity theories with LSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(R, T)$ modified gravity theories being $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We provide detailed equations for the matter energy density contrast. We solve then numerically to promote a comparison with available large scale structure (LSS) formation observational data on $f \sigma_8$ and also addressing the $S_8$ tension. We identify $f(R,T)$ models that lead either to growth enhancement or suppression. Since recent results in the literature indicate a preference for the latter feature, this type of analysis is quite useful to select viable modifications of gravity. We studied class of such $f(R,T)$ models are either ruled out or severely restricted.</description>
