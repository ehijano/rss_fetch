      <title>A Stone-Weierstrass approximation theorem for monotone functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approximation theorem for continuous non-decreasing functions on compact preordered spaces, leading to an algebraic characterization of their corresponding function spaces. As an application, we prove that the family of positive non-decreasing rational functions with non-negative coefficients can uniformly approximate all continuous non-decreasing functions on compact intervals. An explicit approximation formula of this type is provided.</description>

      <title>The Protasov-Zelenyuk topology and ideal convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called $T$-sequences $\mathbf u$ in a group $G$, and the related finest Hausdorff group topology $T_\mathbf u$ on $G$ that makes $\mathbf u$ a null sequence, were introduced by Protasov and Zelenyuk 35 years ago and since then they became a fundamental tool in the field of topological groups. More recently, in the abelian case, the subfamily of $T$-sequences called $TB$-sequences was introduced, as well as the finest precompact group topology $T_\mathbf{pu}$ that makes $\mathbf u$ a null sequence. Here we study the counterpart of all these notions with respect to ideal convergence in place of the classical notion of convergence of a sequence. Also, we study their relation to the already established field of $I$-characterized subgroups of compact abelian groups.</description>

      <title>MapperEEG: A Topological Approach to Brain State Clustering in EEG Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Topological data analysis (TDA) has exploded as a tool for analyzing and making sense of high dimensional datasets across a variety of fields. Mapper is a tool from TDA that captures low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data, precisely the approach needed to capture relevant information from high-dimensional neural time series. Electrical potential scalp recording, or electroencephalography (EEG), is routinely used in clinical applications and research studies thanks to its noninvasive nature, relatively inexpensive equipment, and high temporal resolution. But, it is prone to contamination, exhibits low spatial resolution, and has a non-stationary nature. Thus, it requires advanced signal processing and mathematical analysis methods for tasks requiring unsupervised brain state clustering. New Method: We introduce MapperEEG, an approach to unsupervised brain state clustering that uses tools from classical EEG analysis combined with Mapper to cluster and connect brain states. Results: We show that MapperEEG can serve as a clustering algorithm in the spectral domain and provide additional information about the underlying brain state connectivity in a tapping task. Additionally, we use a go/no-go shooting task to explore how MapperEEG can still provide insight into the underlying structure and clusters of brain states even when it and other clustering methods fail. Comparison with Existing Methods: We demonstrate that it outperforms six other clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering, Hidden Markov Models, and basic autoencoders on identifying states in a tapping task. Conclusions: MapperEEG offers a novel and effective approach to analyzing EEG data, showing promise for brain state clustering and analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first prove a general result in topology which asserts that every quasi-component of a quasi-spectral space is connected. As an important application, the structure of all connected components of every quasi-compact quasi-separated (qcqs) scheme $X$ is fully characterized. They are exactly of the form ...</description>
