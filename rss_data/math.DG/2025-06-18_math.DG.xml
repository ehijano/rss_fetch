      <title>Covering instability for the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a closed non-orientable $3$-manifold admits a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if its orientation double cover does; however, for each $4\le n\le 7$, there exist infinitely many non-homeomorphic smooth non-orientable $n$--manifolds such that each of them does not admit any Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature, but its orientation double cover does. These examples were first introduced by Alpert--Balitskiy--Guth in the study of Urysohn widths.
  To prove the nonexistence result, we extend the Schoen--Yau inductive descent approach to non-orientable manifolds. We also discuss band width estimates and the notion of enlargeability for non-orientable PSC manifolds.</description>

      <title>On completeness of certain locally symmetric pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(2,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show geodesic completeness of certain compact locally symmetric pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature $(2,n)$. Our model space $\mathbf{X}$ is a $1$-connected, indecomposable symmetric space of signature $(2,n)$, that admits a unique (up to scale) parallel lightlike vector field. This class of spaces is the natural generalization of the class of Cahen--Wallach spaces to signature $(2,n)$. In dimension $4$ we show that $\mathbf{X}$ has no proper domain $\Omega$ which is divisible by the action of a discrete group $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{Isom}(\mathbf{X})$, i.e. $\Gamma$ acts properly and cocompactly on $\Omega$. Therefore, we deduce geodesic completeness in the aforementioned situation. In arbitrary dimension we show geodesic completeness of compact locally symmetric space modeled on $\mathbf{X}$ under the assumption that the transition maps of $M$ are restrictions of transvections of $\mathbf{X}$. Along the way, we establish a new case in the Kleinian $3$-dimensional Markus's conjecture for flat affine manifolds. Moreover, we classify geometrically Kleinian compact manifolds that are modeled on the hyperbolic oscillator group endowed with its bi-invariant metric. Finally we discuss a natural dynamical problem motivated by the Lorentz setting (Brinkmann spacetimes). Specifically, we show that the parallel flow on $M$ is equicontinuous in dimension $4$, even in our non-Lorentz setting.</description>

      <title>Left-invariant ${\rm G}_2^*$-structures of type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate left-invariant ${\rm G}_2^*$-structures on 7-dimensional Lie groups, focusing on those whose holonomy algebras are indecomposable and of type III, the latter meaning that the socle of the holonomy representation is maximal. Building on the classification of indecomposable holonomy algebras contained in $\mathfrak g_2^*$, we determine which ones arise as infinitesimal holonomy algebras of type III for left-invariant ${\rm G}_2^*$-structures. Our main result shows that only abelian subalgebras occur, and these are necessarily of dimension two or three. Moreover, we provide explicit Lie groups with left-invariant ${\rm G}_2^*$-structures realizing these abelian holonomies.</description>

      <title>Examples of complete Calabi--Yau metrics on affine smoothings of irregular toric Calabi--Yau cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new examples of affine Calabi--Yau manifolds of Euclidean volume growth and quadratic curvature decay, whose tangent cones at infinity are irregular and have smooth links. In the process, we demonstrate (and provide the relevant computer code) how to explicitly compute the Reeb field and all Minkowski decompositions of a given toric Calabi--Yau cone with smooth link from the data of its toric polytope. Minkowski decompositions of this polytope into lattice segments and/or triangles give rise to smoothings of the given cone. Furthermore, we propose an effective strategy to generate smoothable Calabi--Yau cones from a given non-smoothable one by taking Minkowski sums of certain toric diagrams, and provide an example to illustrate the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of prescribing Chern scalar curvatures on complete Hermitian manifolds. Firstly, we re-prove our recent result for prescribing sign-changing Chern scalar curvatures on compact Hermitian manifolds by using the classical maximum principle. Secondly, we study this problem on complete noncompact Hermitian manifolds, and generalize the Aviles-McOwen's existence results [J. Differential Geom., 21 (1985): 269-281] from Poincar\'e disks to higher dimensional Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Elastic bilayer membranes under confinement -- Existence, regularity, and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to cell biology, we study the constrained minimization of the Helfrich energy among closed surfaces confined to a container. We show existence of minimizers in the class of bubble trees of spherical weak branched immersions and derive the Euler--Lagrange equations which involve a measure-valued Lagrange multiplier that is concentrated on the coincidence set with the container boundary. We provide a careful analysis of this elliptic system and prove optimal regularity for solutions throughout the branch points. For surfaces confined in the unit ball we show that the minimization problem behaves rather rigid and identify a parameter range for which minimizers are always round spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of asymptotically conical Fano fibrations from degenerating Fano fibrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15322v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any asymptotically flat 3-manifold $(M,g)$ with smooth, non-empty, compact boundary $\Sigma$, the conformal conjecture states that for every $\delta&gt;0$, there exists a metric $g' = u^4 g$, with $u$ a harmonic function, such that the area of outermost minimal area enclosure $\tilde{\Sigma}_{g'}$ of $\Sigma$ with respect to $g'$ is less than $\delta$. Recently, the conjecture was used to prove the Riemannian Penrose inequality for black holes with zero horizon area, and was proven to be true under the assumption of existence of only a finite number of minimal area enclosures of boundary $\Sigma$, and boundedness of harmonic function $u$. We prove the conjecture assuming only the boundedness of $u$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a variational approach to the length functional and its relation to sub-Hamiltonian equations on sub-Finsler manifolds. Then, we introduce the notion of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure and prove that the distributions are geodesically invariant concerning the Barthel non-linear connection. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the curves that are abnormal extremals; likewise, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for normal extremals to be the motion of a free nonholonomic mechanical system, and vice versa. Moreover, we show that a coordinate-free approach for a free particle is a comparison between the solutions of the nonholonomic mechanical problem and the solutions of the Vakonomic dynamical problem for the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure. In addition, we provide an example of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure. Finally, we show that the sub-Laplacian measures the curvature of the nonholonomic sub-Finslerian structure.</description>

      <title>PB-groupoids vs VB-groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the principal bundle counterpart of the well-known and widely applied notion of vector bundle groupoid (VB-groupoid). In particular, we provide a general notion of principal bundle groupoid (PB-groupoid) as a diagram of Lie groupoids and principal bundles, together with the action of a (strict) Lie 2-groupoid. This recovers as particular cases various constructions involving structural Lie 2-groups, Lie groupoids and Lie groups. Moreover, given any VB-groupoid, we detect which frames are compatible with the underlying structure and show that the set of such frames has a natural PB-groupoid structure, with the action of the general linear 2-groupoid of the appropriate ranks. We use this construction, as well as that of the associated bundle induced by a 2-representation, to extend the classical correspondence between vector bundles and principal bundles to a new correspondence between VB-groupoids and PB-groupoids. We conclude with several examples and applications.</description>

      <title>Explicit complete Ricci-flat metrics and K\"{a}hler-Ricci solitons on direct sum bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a K\"ahler-Einstein Fano manifold, and $L \to B$ be a suitable root of the canonical bundle. We give a construction of complete Calabi-Yau metrics and gradient shrinking, steady, and expanding K\"ahler-Ricci solitons on the total space $M$, ${\rm dim}_{\mathbb{C}} M = n$ of certain vector bundles $E \to B$, composed of direct sums of powers of $L$. We employ the theory of hamiltonian 2-forms [2, 3] as an Ansatz, thus generalizing recent work of the author and Apostolov on $\mathbb{C}^n$ [5], as well as that of Cao, Koiso, Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf, Futaki-Wang, and Chi Li [10, 26, 23, 24, 30] when $E$ has Calabi symmetry. As a result, we obtain new examples of asymptotically conical K\"ahler shrinkers, Calabi-Yau metrics with ALF-like volume growth, and steady solitons with volume growth $R^{\frac{4n-2}{3}}$.</description>

      <title>Extension of algebroids Part I: The Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of two papers we will generalise the concept of extending a Lie algebroid by a Lie algebra bundle, leading to a notion of extending a Lie algebroid by another Lie algebroid whose orbits lie in the orbits of the former algebroid. The resulting Lie algebroid's anchor will be the sum of the two initial anchors such that the constructions will be similar to matched pairs of Lie algebroids, but with the major difference that we will allow curvatures. In this part of this series we will focus on the canonical construction making use of strict covariant adjustments, a generalisation of Maurer-Cartan forms in the context of gauge theories equipped with a Lie groupoid action instead of a Lie group action. That is, a Cartan connection with certain conditions on the curvature. The second paper will introduce and explain the obstruction of the extension provided here. Examples will include locally split structures as in Poisson geometry.
  As a side result we achieve strong hints towards a possible obstruction theory for certain Cartan connections on Lie algebroids, which will be related to the obstruction of (non-trivial) action algebroids; generalising the statement of the action algebroid structure induced by flat Cartan connections.</description>

      <title>Codimension-Two Spacelike Submanifolds with Umbilical Lightlike Normal Sections and Their Relationship to Lightlike Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study codimension-two spacelike submanifolds in Lorentzian spacetimes that admit umbilical lightlike normal directions. We show that such submanifolds are subject to strong geometric and topological constraints, establishing explicit relationships between extrinsic geometry, mean curvature, and shear-isotropy. In the compact case, we obtain sharp restrictions on their topology. We precisely characterize when the umbilical lightlike normal vector field can be rescaled to be parallel, in terms of the curvature tensor of the ambient spacetime, and prove that this property is conformally invariant. Our main result is a factorization theorem: any such submanifold is contained in a lightlike hypersurface, which is totally umbilical whenever the lightlike normal direction is umbilical. We also provide explicit conformal relations between the induced metrics on the family of spacelike leaves generated by the lightlike normal flow, with consequences for isometry, parallelism of lightlike normal directions, volume evolution, and variational properties. These results yield a detailed geometric framework relevant to the mathematical study of horizons and lightlike structures in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.05652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit classical length identities enjoyed by simple closed curves on hyperbolic surfaces. We state and prove the rigidity of such identities over Teichm\"uller spaces. Due to this rigidity, certain collections of simple closed curves which minimally intersect are characterized on generic hyperbolic surfaces by their lengths.
  As an application, we construct a meagre set $V$ in the Teichm\"uller space of a topological orientable surface $S$, possibly of infinite type. Then the isometry class of a (Nielsen-convex) hyperbolic structure on $S$ outside $V$ is characterized by its unmarked simple length spectrum. Namely, we show that the simple length spectra can be used as moduli for generic hyperbolic surfaces. In the case of compact surfaces, an analogous result using length spectra was obtained by Wolpert.</description>

      <title>Global subelliptic estimates for geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators on closed manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we reconsider the proof of subelliptic estimates for Geometric Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators, a class which includes Bismut's hypoelliptic Laplacian, when the base manifold is closed (no boundary). The method is significantly different from the ones proposed by Bismut-Lebeau in [BiLe] and Lebeau in [Leb1] and [Leb2]. As a new result we are able to prove maximal subelliptic estimates with some control of the constants in the two asymptotic regimes of high (b $\rightarrow$ 0) and low (b $\rightarrow$ +$\infty$) friction. After a dyadic partition in the momentum variable, the analysis is essentially local in the position variable, contrary to the microlocal reduction techniques of the previous works. In particular this method will be easier to adapt on manifolds with boundaries. A byproduct of our analysis is the introduction of a very convenient double exponent Sobolev scale associated with globally defined differential operators. Applications of this convenient parameter dependent functional analysis to accurate spectral problems, in particular for Bismut's hypoelliptic Laplacian with all its specific geometry, is deferred to subsequent works.</description>

      <title>Developments of initial data on big bang singularities for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17065</link>

Abstract: In a recent work, Ringstr\"om proposed a geometric notion of initial data on big bang singularities. Moreover, he conjectured that initial data on the singularity could be used to parameterize quiescent solutions to Einstein's equations; that is, roughly speaking, solutions whose leading order asymptotics are convergent. We prove that given initial data on the singularity for the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations in 4 spacetime dimensions, as defined by Ringstr\"om, there is a corresponding unique development of the data. We do not assume any symmetry or analyticity, and we allow for arbitrary closed spatial topology. Our results thus present an important step towards resolving Ringstr\"om's conjecture. Furthermore, our results show that the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field equations have a geometric singular initial value problem formulation, which is analogous to the classical result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch for initial data on a Cauchy hypersurface.
  In the literature, there are two conditions which are expected to ensure that quiescent behavior occurs. The first one is an integrability condition on a special spatial frame. The second one is an algebraic condition on the eigenvalues of the expansion normalized Weingarten map associated with a foliation of the spacetime near the singularity. Our result is the first such result where both possibilities are allowed. That is, we allow for the first condition to ensure quiescence in one region of space and for the second condition to take over in the region where the first one is violated. This fact allows for our results to include the vacuum setting.</description>

      <title>Extremal domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$: Geometric and Analytic methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{S}^2$ that support positive solutions to the overdetermined problem $ \Delta{u} + f(u, |\nabla u|) = 0 $ in $\Omega$, with the boundary conditions $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$ and $|\nabla u|$ being locally constant along $\partial \Omega$. We refer to such domains as $f$-extremal domains and focus on those with disconnected boundaries. In the first part, we obtain the main results of this paper by extending the moving plane method to $\mathbb{S}^2$, proving that if $\Omega$ is an $f$-extremal domain containing a simple closed curve of maximum points of $u$, then $\Omega$ must be either rotationally symmetric or antipodally symmetric. A similar symmetry result is also obtained for constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces with capillary boundaries. In the second part, we strengthen this conclusion for certain nonlinearities, including the eigenvalue problem ($f(u)=\lambda u$), Serrin problem ($f(u)= \lambda u + c$), harmonic domains in $\mathbb{S}^2$ ($f(u)=c$), and $f(u) = \lambda u + u ^\beta$; for constants $\lambda \geq 2$, $c \geq 0$, and $\beta \in (0,1)$. We prove that the domain $\Omega$ must be rotationally symmetric. We restrict our analysis to the analytic setting to streamline the exposition and emphasize the core ideas, assuming that $\Omega$, $u$, and $f$ are analytic.</description>

      <title>Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Riemannian metrics which are superintegrable in the class of polynomial in momenta integrals. The study is based on our main technical result, Theorem 3, which states that the Poisson bracket of two polynomial in momenta integrals is an algebraic function of
  the integrals and of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that two-dimensional superintegrable Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems, and give arguments supporting this conjecture. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that
  the metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$, are not superintegrable and in particular do not admit nontrivial polynomial in momenta integral of degree less than $k$. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995.</description>

      <title>The dual Minkowski problem for positive indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the stability result of the dual curvature measure with near constant density in the even case. As an application, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the even dual Minkowski problem for positive indices in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are obtained with $n\geq 1$, provided the density of the given measure is close to 1 in the $C^{\alpha}$ norm with $\alpha\in (0,1)$.</description>
