      <title>A Multimodal Human Protein Embeddings Database: DeepDrug Protein Embeddings Bank (DPEB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings), contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling. Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.</description>

      <title>Graph Identification of Proteins in Tomograms (GRIP-Tomo) 2.0: Topologically Aware Classification for Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables structural characterization of biomolecules under near-native conditions. Existing approaches for interpreting the resulting three-dimensional volumes are computationally expensive and have difficulty interpreting density associated with small proteins/complexes. To explore alternate approaches for identifying proteins in cryo-ET data we pursued a Graph Network and topologically invariant approach. Here, we report on a fast algorithm that distinguishes volumes containing protein density from noise by searching for nuances of evolutionarily conversed motifs and the geometrical characteristics of protein structure. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 is a machine-learning pipeline that extracts interpretable topological features of protein structures within noisy experimental backgrounds. Compared to version 1.0, the new pipeline includes three upgrades that significantly improve performance including synthetic tomogram generation simulating realistic noise, graph-based persistent feature extraction as protein fingerprints, and high-performance computing acceleration. GRIP-Tomo 2.0 achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing proteins from noise for synthetic datasets and over 80% accuracy for real datasets, which represents a foundational step toward advancing cryo-ET workflows and empowering automated detection of both small and large proteins for visual proteomics.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02409v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</description>
