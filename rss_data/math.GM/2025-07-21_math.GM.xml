      <title>Unified Frequency-Domain Reconstruction and Boundary Adaptation for Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global regularity for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains unresolved partly because weak, mild, and strong formulations employ incompatible functional settings. The present study introduces a frequency-domain framework that reconciles these formulations within a single constructive scheme. Starting from Leray-Hopf data, a scale-dependent regularization operator combining mollification, Sobolev extension, and the Leray projector produces smooth, divergence-free approximations. Two bounded Fourier multipliers are then defined: an interpolation operator that blends low-frequency weak and high-frequency strong components, and a smoothing operator that yields uniform parabolic gain. Littlewood-Paley analysis, refined Calderon-Zygmund and Schauder estimates, and an explicit Galerkin scheme provide quantitative Hs a priori bounds and a lifespan controlled by the first Stokes eigenvalue. Compactness via the Aubin-Lions lemma and dominated convergence demonstrates that, as the regularization parameter vanishes, the approximations converge to a single velocity field satisfying simultaneously the weak energy identity, the Fujita-Kato mild formulation, and the strong formulation in Hs with s &gt; 3/2. The construction furnishes a unified local solution and supplies operator bounds required for subsequent energy-vorticity bootstraps and global continuation arguments, clarifying the interplay between frequency localization and nonlinear estimates in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Algebras of $p$-Adic Distributions Induced by Pointwise Products of F-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an integer $\geq2$ and let $K$ be a global field. A foliated $p$-adic F-series is a function $X$ of a $p$-adic integer variable $\mathfrak{z}$ satisfying the functional equations $X\left(p\mathfrak{z}+j\right)=a_{j}X\left(\mathfrak{z}\right)+b_{j}$ for all $\mathfrak{z}\in\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ and all $j\in\left\{ 0,\ldots,p-1\right\} $, where the $a_{j}$s and $b_{j}$s are indeterminates. Treating $X$ as taking value in a certain ring of formal power series over $K$, this paper establishes a universal/functorial Fourier theory for F-series: we show that $X$ has a Fourier transform, and that, for nearly any ideal $I\subseteq R$, where of $R=\mathcal{O}_{K}\left[a_{0},\ldots,a_{p-1},b_{0},\ldots,b_{p-1}\right]$, this Fourier transform descends through the quotient mod $I$ which imposes on $X$ the relations encoded by $I$. Furthermore, we show that the pointwise product of $X$ with itself $n$ times also has a Fourier transform compatible with descent. These results generalize to products $X_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdots X_{d}^{e_{d}}$ of any $d$ distinct F-series $X_{1},\ldots,X_{d}$ with integer exponents $e_{1},\ldots,e_{d}\geq0$. Using these Fourier transforms, F-series and their products can be identified with distributions on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ in a manner compatible with descent mod $I$, forming algebras under pointwise multiplication. Also, to any given F-series or product thereof, one can associate an affine algebraic variety over $K$ which I call the breakdown variety. The distributions induced by a product of F-series under descent mod $I$ exhibit sensitivity to $I$'s containment of the ideal corresponding to the distributions' breakdown varieties. This yields a novel method of encoding given affine algebraic varieties through distributions in a way compatible with pointwise products, convolutions, and tensor products.</description>

      <title>Deriving Closed-Form Expressions for Arithmetic Sequence Sums Raised to Integer Powers via Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a symbolic calculus-based approach for deriving closed-form expressions for the sums of arithmetic sequences. The method extends beyond constant-difference sequences to those with polynomially increasing steps, including linear, quadratic, cubic, and higher-order forms. Using elementary techniques from differentiation and integration, the approach produces polynomial expressions that represent total sums, even when each term is raised to a positive integer power. As a result, Bernoulli numbers emerge naturally in the formulas, linking the approach to classical results in a concise and accessible manner.</description>
