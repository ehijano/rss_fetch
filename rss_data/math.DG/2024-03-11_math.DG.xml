      <title>Towards a geometric theory of integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration is the final key step when turning an infinitesimal argument into a result applicable to quantities of finite size. Conceptually, it is about combining infinitesimal contributions to a finite whole. We make a first step towards a geometric theory of integration in the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG) by analysing the differential aspect of the integration process. Starting from two heuristic principles that combine the idea of differential forms as infinitesimal measures while formalising the process of taking infinitesimal differences at the same time we derive a general notion of differential form as an equivariant map from infinitesimal $n$-cuboids to the base ring coordinatising a line. Besides the familiar differential forms introduced by Cartan we discover two new types. We also discover a new differential operator besides the exterior derivative. Analogous to the relationship between the exterior derivative and the Stokes-Cartan integral theorem, this new operator is linked to the generalised Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in higher dimensions, as discussed in prior research. This shows that the Fundamental Theorem is an integral theorem like Stokes-Cartan, but for one of the new types of differential forms.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi Flows for Total Geodesic Curvatures in hyperbolic background geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hyperbolic background geometry, we investigate a generalized circle packing (including circles, horocycles and hypercycles) with conical singularities on a surface with boundary, which has a total geodesic curvature on each generalized circle of this circle packing and a discrete Gaussian curvature on the center of each dual circle. The purpose of this paper is to find this type of circle packings with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles. To achieve this goal, we firstly establish existence and rigidity on this type of circle packings by the variational principle. Secondly, for $p&gt;1$, we introduce combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flows to find the circle packing with prescribed total geodesic curvatures on generalized circles and discrete Gaussian curvatures on centers of dual circles for the first time.</description>

      <title>Local and global blow-downs of transport twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport twistor spaces are degenerate complex $2$-dimensional manifolds $Z$ that complexify transport problems on Riemannian surfaces, appearing e.g.~in geometric inverse problems. This article considers maps $\beta\colon Z\to \mathbb{C}^2$ with a holomorphic blow-down structure that resolve the degeneracy of the complex structure and allow to gain insight into the complex geometry of $Z$. The main theorems provide global $\beta$-maps for constant curvature metrics and their perturbations and local $\beta$-maps for arbitrary metrics, thereby proving a version of the classical Newlander--Nirenberg theorem for degenerate complex structures.</description>

      <title>Quasi-spherical metrics and the static Minkowski inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that equality within the Minkowski inequality for asymptotically flat static spaces is achieved only by slices in Schwarzschild space for mean-convex, non-negative scalar curvature boundaries. In order to establish this, we prove uniqueness of quasi-spherical static metrics: any quasi-spherical metric with vanishing shear vector that admits a bounded static vacuum potential is a rotationally symmetric piece of Schwarzschild space. We also observe that the static Minkowski inequality extends to all dimensions when the boundary is connected and to weakly asymptotically flat static spaces. As a result, the uniqueness theorems for photon surfaces and static metric extensions from our prequel extend to this larger class and to all dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kr\"oncke has shown that the Fubini-Study metric is an unstable generalized stationary solution of Ricci flow [Kr\"o20]. In this paper, we carry out numerical simulations which indicate that Ricci flow solutions originating at unstable perturbations of the Fubini-Study metric develop local singularities modeled by the blowdown soliton discovered in [FIK03].</description>

      <title>Moduli space theory for complete, constant Q-curvature metrics on finitely punctured spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study constant Q-curvature metrics conformal to the round metric on the sphere with finitely many point singularities. We show that the moduli space of solutions with finitely many punctures in fixed positions, equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, has the local structure of a real analytic variety with formal dimension equal to the number of the punctures. If a nondegeneracy hypothesis holds, we show that a neighborhood in the moduli space is actually a real-analytic manifold of the expected dimension. We also construct a geometrically natural set of parameters, construct a symplectic structure on this parameter space and show that in the smooth case a small neighborhood of the moduli space embeds as a Lagrangian submanifold in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of \emph{algebraifold}, by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring.Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the quantitative version of the Alexandrov theorem for capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space. The proof is based on the quantitative analysis of the Montiel-Ros-type argument, carried out in the joint works with Wang-Xia \cites{JWXZ22-B,JWXZ23}. As by-products, we obtain new Michael-Simon-type inequality and Topping-type inequality for capillary hypersurfaces in the half-space.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>

      <title>Pulling back symmetric Riemannian geometry for data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sets tend to live in low-dimensional non-linear subspaces. Ideal data analysis tools for such data sets should therefore account for such non-linear geometry. The symmetric Riemannian geometry setting can be suitable for a variety of reasons. First, it comes with a rich mathematical structure to account for a wide range of non-linear geometries that has been shown to be able to capture the data geometry through empirical evidence from classical non-linear embedding. Second, many standard data analysis tools initially developed for data in Euclidean space can also be generalised efficiently to data on a symmetric Riemannian manifold. A conceptual challenge comes from the lack of guidelines for constructing a symmetric Riemannian structure on the data space itself and the lack of guidelines for modifying successful algorithms on symmetric Riemannian manifolds for data analysis to this setting. This work considers these challenges in the setting of pullback Riemannian geometry through a diffeomorphism. The first part of the paper characterises diffeomorphisms that result in proper, stable and efficient data analysis. The second part then uses these best practices to guide construction of such diffeomorphisms through deep learning. As a proof of concept, different types of pullback geometries -- among which the proposed construction -- are tested on several data analysis tasks and on several toy data sets. The numerical experiments confirm the predictions from theory, i.e., that the diffeomorphisms generating the pullback geometry need to map the data manifold into a geodesic subspace of the pulled back Riemannian manifold while preserving local isometry around the data manifold for proper, stable and efficient data analysis, and that pulling back positive curvature can be problematic in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theorems for Timelike Surfaces in the Minkowski 4-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study timelike surfaces free of minimal points in the four-dimensional Minkowski space. For each such surface we introduce a geometrically determined pseudo-orthonormal frame field and writing the derivative formulas with respect to this moving frame field and using the integrability conditions, we obtain a system of six functions satisfying some natural conditions. In the general case, we prove a Fundamental Bonnet-type theorem (existence and uniqueness theorem) stating that these six functions, satisfying the natural conditions, determine the surface up to a motion. In some particular cases, we reduce the number of functions and give the fundamental theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss--Bonnet--Chern mass) holds.</description>

      <title>Connection Laplacian on discrete tori with converging property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the spectral properties of the connection Laplacian for both real and discrete tori. We introduce novel methods to examine these eigenvalues by employing parallel orthonormal basis in the pullback bundle on universal covering spaces. Our main results reveal that the eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian on a real torus can be expressed in terms of standard Laplacian eigenvalues, with a unique twist encapsulated in the torsion matrix. This connection is further investigated in the context of discrete tori, where we demonstrate similar results.
  A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to exploring the convergence properties of a family of discrete tori towards a real torus. We extend previous findings on the spectrum of the standard Laplacian to include the connection Laplacian, revealing that the rescaled eigenvalues of discrete tori converge to those of the real torus. Furthermore, our analysis of the discrete torus occurs within a broader context, where it is not constrained to being a product of cyclic groups. Additionally, we delve into the theta functions associated with these structures, providing a detailed analysis of their behavior and convergence.
  The paper culminates in a study of the regularized log-determinant of the connection Laplacian and the converging results of it. We derive formulae for both real and discrete tori, emphasizing their dependence on the spectral zeta function and theta functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Neumann problem for special Lagrangian type equations with critical and supercritical phases. These equations naturally generalize the special Lagrangian equation and the k-Hessian equation. By establishing uniform a priori estimates up to the second order, we obtain the existence result using the continuity method. The new technical aspect is our direct proof of boundary double normal derivative estimates. In particular, we directly prove the double normal estimates for the 2-Hessian equation in dimension 3. Moreover, we solve the classical Neumann problem by proving the uniform gradient estimate.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous quandles with abelian inner automorphism groups and vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic system originated in knot theory, and can be regarded as a generalization of symmetric spaces. The inner automorphism group of a quandle is defined as the group generated by the point symmetries (right multiplications). In this paper, starting from any simple graphs, we construct quandles whose inner automorphism groups are abelian. We also prove that the constructed quandle is homogeneous if and only if the graph is vertex-transitive. This shows that there is a wide family of quandles with abelian inner automorphism groups, even if we impose the homogeneity. The key examples of such quandles are realized as subquandles of oriented real Grassmannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Explicit formula of deformation quantization with separation of variables for complex two-dimensional locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complex two-dimensional noncommutative locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold via a deformation quantization with separation of variables. We present an explicit formula of its star product by solving the system of recurrence relations given by Hara-Sako. In the two-dimensional case, this system of recurrence relations gives two types of equations corresponding to the two coordinates. From the two types of recurrence relations, symmetrized and antisymmetrized recurrence relations are obtained. The symmetrized one gives the solution of the recurrence relation. From the antisymmetrized one, the identities satisfied by the solution are obtained. The star products for $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ are constructed by the method obtained in this study, and we verify that these star products satisfy the identities.</description>

      <title>Estimates for low Steklov eigenvalues of surfaces with several boundary components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we give computable lower bounds for the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue $\sigma_1$ of a compact connected 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with several cylindrical boundary components. These estimates show how the geometry of $M$ away from the boundary affects this eigenvalue. They involve geometric quantities specific to manifolds with boundary such as the extrinsic diameter of the boundary. In a second part, we give lower and upper estimates for the low Steklov eigenvalues of a hyperbolic surface with a geodesic boundary in terms of the length of some families of geodesics. This result is similar to a well known result of Schoen, Wolpert and Yau for Laplace eigenvalues on a closed hyperbolic surface.</description>

      <title>The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric approach to the construction of moment maps in finite and infinite-dimensional complex geometry. We apply this to two settings: K\"ahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles. Our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms.
  For K\"ahler manifolds we give a new, geometric proof of Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature. Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold - namely to a central charge - we further introduce a geometric PDE determining a $Z$-critical K\"ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties. For holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills condition. We then go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE determining a $Z$-critical connection - again associated to a choice of central charge - can be viewed as a moment map; deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry - associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition - and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing PDE counterparts to stability conditions in large generality.</description>

      <title>Vertical isomorphisms of Fedosov dg manifolds associated with a Lie pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vertical isomorphisms of Fedosov dg manifolds associated with a Lie pair $(L,A)$, i.e. a pair of a Lie algebroid $L$ and a Lie subalgebroid $A$ of $L$. The construction of Fedosov dg manifolds involves a choice of a splitting and a connection. We prove that, given any two choices of a splitting and a connection, there exists a unique vertical isomorphism, determined by an iteration formula, between the two associated Fedosov dg manifolds. As an application, we provide an explicit formula for the map $\mathrm{pbw}_2^{-1}\circ \mathrm{pbw}_1$ associated with two Poincar\'{e}--Birkhoff--Witt isomorphisms that arise from two choices of a splitting and a connection.</description>

      <title>Localized Deformation of the Scalar Curvature and the Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. We prove that this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. This result is a generalization of Corvino's result about localized scalar curvature deformations; however, the existence part needs to be handled delicately since the problem is non-variational. We also briefly discuss generic conditions that guarantee localized deformations, and some related geometric properties.</description>

      <title>All paths admit trajectoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper published in Nature, Y.I. Sobolev et al. introduced the concept of trajectoids: convex, rigid objects, which roll without slip or spin on a flat plane along a prescribed periodic, unbounded planar path. A geometric construction method applicable to many paths was introduced, and the theory was experimentally verified using objects rolling downwards on slightly inclined planes. The construction method was applicable to many but not all curves. A possible extension of the method (referred to as period-n trajectoids) was also proposed, but the limits of applicability were not clarified. Here, a geometric proof is given for the existence of period-n trajectoids for any sufficiently smooth prescribed curve. A somewhat different proof was recently proposed by O. Muller independently from this work. We also highlight some related geometry problems.</description>

      <title>Baum-Bott residue currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation of rank $\kappa$ on a complex manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, let $Z$ be a compact connected component of the singular set of $\mathscr{F}$, and let $\Phi \in \mathbb C[z_1,\ldots,z_n]$ be a homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree $\ell$ with $n-\kappa &lt; \ell \leq n$. Given a locally free resolution of the normal sheaf of $\mathscr{F}$, equipped with Hermitian metrics and certain smooth connections, we construct an explicit current $R^\Phi_Z$ with support on $Z$ that represents the Baum-Bott residue $\text{res}^\Phi(\mathscr{F}; Z)\in H_{2n-2\ell}(Z, \mathbb C)$ and is obtained as the limit of certain smooth representatives of $\text{res}^\Phi(\mathscr{F}; Z)$. If the connections are $(1,0)$-connections and $\text{codim} Z\geq \ell$, then $R^\Phi_Z$ is independent of the choice of metrics and connections. When $\mathscr{F}$ has rank one we give a more precise description of $R^\Phi_Z$ in terms of so-called residue currents of Bochner-Martinelli type. In particular, when the singularities are isolated, we recover the classical expression of Baum-Bott residues in terms of Grothendieck residues.</description>

      <title>Ray-Singer Torsion, Topological Strings and Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genus one amplitude for topological strings on Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be computed using mirror symmetry: The partition function at genus one gets mapped to a holomorphic version of Ray-Singer torsion on the mirror Calabi-Yau. On the other hand it can be shown by a physical argument that this gives a curvature squared correction term to the gravitational action. This in paticular leads to an effective quantum gravity cutoff known as the species scale, which varies over moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds. This resolves some of the puzzles associated to the entropy of small black holes when there are a large number of light species of particles. Thus Ray-Singer torsion, via its connection to topological strings at genus one, provides a measure of light degrees of freedom of four dimensional N=2 supergravity theories. Based on a talk given on May 12th, 2023 at the Singer Memorial Conference, MIT.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial proof of the positivity of Quasi-Local mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

      <title>On the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the critical points of Steklov eigenfunctions on a compact, smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. For generic metrics on $M$ we establish an identity which relates the sum of the indexes of a Steklov eigenfunction, the sum of the indexes of its restriction to $\partial M$, and the Euler characteristic of $M$. In dimension $2$ this identity gives a precise count of the interior critical points of a Steklov eigenfunction in terms of the Euler characteristic of $M$ and of the number of sign changes of $u$ on $\partial M$. In the case of the second Steklov eigenfunction on a genus $0$ surface, the identity holds for any metric. As a by-product of the main result, we show that for generic metrics on $M$ Steklov eigenfunctions are Morse functions in $M$.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution in Random Polynomials and Systems of Random Holomorphic Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses an equidistribution problem concerning the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections of positive line bundles on compact K\"{a}hler manifolds and random polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{m}$ in the setting of a compact subset. For random polynomials, we consider non-orthonormal bases and prove an equidistribution result which are more general than the previously acquired ones for non-discrete probability measures. More precisely, our result demonstrates that the equidistribution holds true even when the random coefficients in the basis representation are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and moreover, they are not constrained to any particular probability distribution function. For random holomorphic sections, by extending the concept of a sequence of asymptotically Bernstein-Markov measures introduced by Levenberg, Bloom and Bayraktar in their recent paper to the setting of holomorphic line bundles over compact K\"{a}hler manifolds, we derive a global equidistribution theorem related to the zeros of systems of random holomorphic sections for large tensor powers of a fixed line bundle for any codimension $k$. In both settings using the variance estimation technique in another study of the author with Bojnik plays an important role.</description>
