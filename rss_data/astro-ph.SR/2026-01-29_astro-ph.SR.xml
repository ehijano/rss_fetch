      <title>A constrained linear model for continuum normalization of stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring stellar parameters and chemical abundances by forward modeling stellar spectra usually requires a spectral synthesis code, or an emulator constructed from a curated training set. In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $\alpha$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N ~ 100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N ~ 30.</description>

      <title>The Role of Long Period Variable Stars in Observational Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period variables (LPVs) are evolved red giant and supergiant stars whose pulsations provide unique insights into late stages of stellar evolution and serve as essential tools in modern astrophysics. Their period-luminosity and period-age relations make them valuable distance and age indicators, while their light curve morphology, amplitudes, and multiperiodicity reveal the underlying physics of stellar interiors and mass-loss. In this review, we provide an overview of the current status of LPV studies, focusing on their observational properties and applications, including:
  - Modern classification of LPVs into Miras, semiregular variables (SRVs), and OGLE small-amplitude red giants (OSARGs), which occupy multiple period-luminosity sequences associated with different pulsation modes, chemical compositions, and evolutionary stages
  - Mira variables as reliable distance indicators across diverse stellar environments and their increasing role as standard candles
  - The increasing role of SRVs and OSARGs
  - Long secondary period (LSP) variables as potential tracers of exoplanets
  Together with advances in theoretical modeling, these developments establish LPVs as valuable tracers of Galactic structure, stellar populations, and the extragalactic distance scale.</description>

      <title>Stellar and orbital characterization of three low mass M dwarf binary stars with dynamical spectroscopy from the Habitable Zone Planet Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of low-mass stars continue to be discrepant with observations when used to examine the mass-radius relationship and other physical parameters of individual stars. High-resolution spectroscopy that leads to dynamical measurements of binary stars can directly improve these models. We have been using the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph to monitor binary stars with M dwarf components. Here, we measure the orbital and stellar parameters for three such systems: LSPM J0515+5911, NLTT 43564, and NLTT 45468. Each system has dozens of spectra obtained over a baseline of several years. None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions. LSPM J0515+5911 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with period of $126.948 \pm 0.029$ days and derived minimum masses, $M_1\sin^3i =0.058 \pm 0.002$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2\sin^3i = 0.046 \pm 0.001$ $M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively. We solved NLTT 43564 with period of $1877 \pm 24$ days and NLTT 45468 with period of $9.686 \pm 0.001$ days as single lined systems, and modeled the primary masses to be $M_1 = 0.32\pm{0.02}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_1 = 0.35^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ $M_\odot$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stellar equatorial rotational velocities with Gaia DR3 line broadening -- the dependence on temperature, mass and age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used more than $10^5$ Gaia DR3 line broadening vbroad measurements to examine stellar rotation as a function of stellar temperature, mass and age. The large sample clearly displays the Kraft break at $\sim 6{,}500$\,K, or mass of $\sim1.3\,M_{\odot}$-while vbroad are small, on the order of $10$-$20$ km/s, for stars cooler than the Kraft break, they sharply rise above the break, reaching up $\sim100$ km/s with temperature of $7{,}000$ K. To follow the stellar rotation as a function of age, we consider vbroad as a function of scaled age-stellar age divided by the relevant Terminal Age Main Sequence (MS), for four narrow mass bins. We find that stellar rotation deceleration is slow during the MS phase and fast afterwards for stars hotter than the break, whereas deceleration rate is relatively high and does not vary much for the cool stars. Our findings are consistent with the theory that stellar rotation slowing is due to magnetic breaking, emanating from magnetic fields that are anchored to the stellar convective envelopes. Therefore, deceleration is high in cool stars, but in hot stars only after they leave the MS and develop convective outer layers</description>

      <title>The 2025 Evaluation of Experimental Thermonuclear Reaction Rates (ETR25)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided.</description>

      <title>Origin of Coronal Extreme Ultraviolet Shockwaves without a Coronal Mass Ejection Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading theory of sunquake generation involves flare-accelerated particles depositing energy into the photosphere. Simulations of sunquake excitation suggest co-excitation with wavefronts propagating in the corona and chromosphere, similar to Moreton-Ramsey waves, and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). To investigate observational evidence for the particle-driven mechanism in LCPFs, we compare populations of events associated with and without coronal mass ejections (CMEs). CMEs are known to generate similar EUV shock waves. We employ a visual inspection of flare events that generate LCPFs using Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) coronagraph images to find that coronal waves associated with CMEs propagate noticeably faster. Then we examine GOES soft X-ray (SXR) data of standalone flare events (those that generate coronal waves without CMEs), focusing on soft X-ray (SXR) characteristics related to magnetic energy release rate. This reveals that such standalone or confined flares differ from sunquake flares: they are less impulsive and energetic than sunquake flares. However, they are more impulsive but less energetic than LCPF-associated flares with a CME. In particular, coronal waves accompanied by CMEs exhibit significantly higher volume emission measures, suggesting a different generation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Accretion Properties of the Young Brown Dwarf 2MASS J08440915-7833457</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HST-COS FUV and -STIS optical observations towards the young accreting brown dwarf 2MASS-J08440915-7833457 (J0844) from the ULLYSES DDT Program. We analyse hot FUV lines such C IV, Si IV, and N V, as well as fluorescent emission from H2. Despite evidence for accretion, the C IV line profiles are narrower than in typical classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs), resembling weak-lined T Tauri stars more closely. Additionally, the C IV integrated line flux does not follow the level expected of an accreting object in the magnetically saturated regime. However, comparing J0844 to appropriate low mass analogs, J0844 does show excess C IV emission characteristic of accretion, suggesting the magnetic saturation level may need to be redefined for the lowest mass objects. The C IV/Si IV emission line ratio is found to be 20, which is higher than most CTTSs, with a few exceptions (e.g., TW Hya). We fit the STIS optical spectrum to calculate an accretion rate, which we find to be 4.2 x 10-11 Msol/yr. The accretion rate found based on the empirical LCIV-Macc relationship is twoorders of magnitude higher, suggesting this relationship may not hold at the lowest masses. We find the H2 emission appears to originate within the co-rotation radius, pointing to either disc truncation well inside the co-rotation radius or additional sources of H2 emission that we do not consider (e.g., from the accretion flow itself). These data provide an extension of our current understanding of accretion and inner disc conditions to the relatively unexplored lowest mass regime.</description>

      <title>Fast variability and circular polarization of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser in G33.641$-$0.228</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.</description>

      <title>On the contradictory case of the binary system HD 81809 hosting two pulsating solar-like stars observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new comprehensive study of HD81809, a nearby binary system of two solar-like stars showing high-amplitude X-ray emission and a well-defined 8-year solar-like magnetic cycle. By analyzing high-resolution spectroscopy, alongside DR3 Gaia astrometry, and bolometric fluxes, we derive updated fundamental parameters for both components. In particular, we uncover a significant chemical difference: the primary is metal-poor ([Fe/H]$ \simeq - 0.57$), while the secondary shows solar-like metallicity ([Fe/H]$=0.00$). This suggests that the system originated in a mildly metal-poor environment, consistent with the Galactic thick disk population, and that the secondary's surface composition has been altered by a recent accretion event. Using multi-sector TESS photometry, we detected solar-like oscillations in both components, deriving global asteroseismic parameters $\Delta\nu = 43.32 \pm 3.91 \mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 708.74^{+3.23}_{-3.74} \mu$Hz for HD81809 A, and $\Delta\nu = 97.75 \pm 4.49~\mu$Hz, $\nu_{\rm max} = 2098.07^{+3.07}_{-2.83} \mu$Hz for HD81809 B. By combining all the observational constraints with stellar evolutionary models computed using CLES and MESA codes, we reconstructed the evolutionary scenario of the system. Our results indicate that HD 81809 is an old system with an age of $\sim 10 \mathrm{Gyr}$, composed of a subgiant primary with mass $\sim 0.87M_{\odot}$ and radius $\sim1.96R_{\odot}$ - likely responsible for the reactivated dynamo cycle - and a main sequence secondary with mass $ M=0.85M_{\odot}$ and radius $R=1.10R_{\odot}$. This system represents a benchmark for studying stellar evolution, magnetic activity, and the physics of old, metal-poor stars in the Galactic thick disk.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project: XVI. Surface helium abundances in Galactic O-type stars: indications for identifying binary interaction products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction -- particularly mass-transfer episodes -- may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe&gt;0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth.</description>

      <title>Fading Echoes of Interaction: Probing Centuries of Mass-Loss in Four Old Type IIn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim4\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\rm{\dot M\sim2 \times 10^{-3}~\rm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\rm{\dot M&lt;2\times10^{-3}~M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr.</description>

      <title>H$_2^{18}$O in the terrestrial planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks</title>

Abstract: Isotopologues play an important role in solar system cosmochemistry studies, revealing details of early planet formation physics and chemistry. Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations. We suggest that either the H$_2^{18}$O-rich water has been removed from the emitting region and replaced by H$_2^{18}$O-poor water formed by reactions with $^{18}$O-poor CO, or that the gas-phase water is depleted in $^{18}$O via mass-dependent fractionation processes at the water snowline.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical thermonuclear supernovae triggered by the tidal disruption of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap. WD TDEs may produce a diverse set of transients with extreme asymmetry and peculiar composition.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of organics in the Horsehead nebula: signposts of chemistry driven by atomic carbon</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered essential precursors to prebiotic species. While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>From cosmological simulations to binary black hole mergers: The impact of using analytical star formation history models on gravitational-wave source populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\,M_\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.</description>

Abstract: Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of K- to G-type stars create an RV effect in amplitude of less than 1 \si{\meter\per\second} and have orbital periods of hundreds of days. Only long-term RV surveys with sub-meter per second precision instruments can explore the outer regions of Sun-like stars and look for Earth-like planets and super-Earths. We present the analysis of the K-type star HD 176986. It has a brightness of V=8.45 mag and a distance from the Sun of d = 27.88 pc. This star hosts a known planetary system of two super-Earths. We joined historical datasets with new data collected in an ongoing blind search program. We took advantage of recently developed tools for RV extraction and stellar activity filtering. The analysis of activity indicators permits us to determine the period of the magnetic cycle of the star alongside its rotation period. We performed a joint analysis of RVs and activity indicators through multidimensional GPs to better constrain the activity model in RVs and avoid overfitting. We detected a new planet orbiting the star and retrieved the two known planets. HD 176986 b has an orbital period of 6.49164$^{+0.00030}_{-0.00029}$ d and a minimum mass of 5.36 $\pm$ 0.44 M$\oplus$. HD 176986 c has an orbital period of P$_c$ = 16.8124 $\pm$ 0.0015 d and a minimum mass of 9.75$_{-0.64}^{+0.65}$ M$\oplus$. HD 176986 d has an orbital period of 61.376$^{+0.051}_{-0.049}$ d and a minimum mass of 6.76$_{-0.92}^{+0.91}$ M$\oplus$. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period of 2432$_{-59}^{+64}$ d, along with a rotation period of 36.05 $_{-0.71}^{+0.67}$ d. We discover a new planet in the multi-planet system orbiting the K-type star HD 176986. All the planets have minimum masses compatible with super-Earths or mini-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Sunward Streaming 3He-rich SEP Events Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe during Perihelion Passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on two 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed by Solar Orbiter (SO) and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the April 1 - 4, 2024 conjunction when both spacecraft are within 0.3 AU near their respective perihelion passage. The two 3He-rich SEP events, originating from active region (AR) 13615, exhibit two key anomalies: (1) sunward streaming SEPs and (2) SEP travel path lengths exceeding 2 - 8 times the nominal Parker spiral expectations. Remote observations suggest these SEPs have been redirected by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) that also originated from AR 13615 two days prior on March 30, 2024 at 21:04 UT. Using the near-Sun CME speed and width measurements, we estimate its size and location at the onset time of the first 3He-rich SEP event. Based on our estimates, SEPs propagating around the ICME front have travelled between 0.76 - 0.95 AU when they arrive at SO, increasing to 0.94 - 1.1 AU at PSP, consistent with our observed SEP arrival times. These findings constitute the first multi-spacecraft observation of sunward streaming 3He-rich SEPs. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon on 3He-rich seed material and the rare widespread 3He-rich SEP events (see Section 5.4).</description>

      <title>Growth of Metal-Enriched Supermassive Stars by Accretion and Collisions</title>

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMSs) are candidate progenitors of massive black hole seeds and may contribute to anomalous abundance patterns in high-redshift galaxies and globular clusters. Recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations indicate that SMSs can form at finite metallicity, not only in metal-free direct-collapse conditions. We model SMS growth with \textsc{GENEC} over $Z/Z_\odot=10^{-5}$-$10^{-2}$ using simulation-motivated accretion histories. The final masses reach $\sim7.2\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ at $10^{-5}\,Z_\odot$ and $\sim2.3\times10^{3}\,M_\odot$ at $10^{-2}\,Z_\odot$. Models are evolved through the pre-main sequence and core H-burning phases, terminating at the onset of general-relativistic instability for $Z\lesssim10^{-4}\,Z_\odot$ or at core He exhaustion for $Z\gtrsim10^{-3}\,Z_\odot$. The dominant mass growth channel transitions from collision-driven to accretion-driven between $Z=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$. With stellar lifetimes remaining nearly constant at $1.8$-$2.0$ Myr, collisions do not significantly rejuvenate the star, implying that collision driven runaway collapse cannot proceed in isolation and must be supplemented, and likely dominated by gas accretion. We further compute the critical inflow rate required to keep the stellar envelope inflated, $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, which decreases with increasing $Z$ and decreasing central mass fraction of hydrogen ($X_{\rm c}$). The critical rate falls below $10^{-5}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ at $X_{\rm c}=0.60$ for $10^{-2}Z_\odot$. This indicates that SMSs with $0.01~Z_\odot$ are cool supergiants during most of their lifetimes, where UV photon emissivity and radiative feedback is strongly suppressed. Overall, SMS evolution remains viable up to $Z\simeq0.01\,Z_\odot$, supporting SMS formation in proto-globular clusters and other metal-enriched dense environments.</description>

      <title>Solar carbon abundance from 3D non-LTE modelling of the diagnostic lines of the CH molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral lines of the CH molecule are a key carbon (C) abundance diagnostic in FGKM-type stars. These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 $\r{A}$) and infrared (33025 - 37944 $\r{A}$). We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. 2023 and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied. We find generally small ($\sim$0.01 dex) NLTE effects in the optical and IR diagnostic CH A-X lines in the solar atmosphere. Both 3D NLTE and 3D LTE spectral modelling yield an excellent fit to the solar intensity observations at all viewing angles. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=8.52$\pm$0.07 dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451656.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an 8.56 minute orbital period mass transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with mean Gaia magnitude G=19.51. The system was identified via periodic variability in Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System light curves of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium dominated accretion disk, while high speed ULTRACAM photometry shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade long orbital timing baseline using ATLAS and Gaia survey photometry together with high speed observations from ULTRACAM on the NTT and proto Lightspeed on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline we measure an orbital period derivative Pdot = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of Pdot indicate orbital evolution governed by the interplay between gravitational wave driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational radiation, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain. We predict a four year Laser Interferometer Space Antenna signal to noise ratio greater than 10, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective space based gravitational wave source that probes long term orbital evolution in the mass transferring regime.</description>

      <title>Pulsations change the structures of massive stars before explosion: interpreting SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi</title>

Abstract: Massive red supergiants (RSGs) are known to become hydrodynamically unstable before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to "early-excess" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi, for which pulsating RSG progenitors were reported. We demonstrate that the pre- and post-SN characteristics of SN 2023ixf agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model and exhibit meaningful differences from hydrostatic models. The data coverage is insufficient to break all degeneracies. We find insufficient evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN 2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models, in particular for massive stars from $\gtrsim 15\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

      <title>Virtual states and exponential decay in small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Kazantsev theory of small-scale dynamo generation at small Prandtl numbers near the generation threshold and restore the concordance between the theory and numerical simulations: the theory predicted a power-law decay below the threshold, while simulations demonstrate exponential decay. We show that the exponential decay is temporary and owes its existence to the flattening of the velocity correlator at large scales. This effect corresponds to the existence of a long-living virtual level in the corresponding Schrodinger type equation. We also find the critical Reynolds number and the increment of growth/decay above and under the threshold; we express them in terms of the quantitative characteristic properties of the velocity correlator, which makes it possible to compare the results with the data of different simulations.</description>

      <title>Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $\nu i$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics. Besides the widely studied $s$, $i$, and $r$ processes in moderately-to-strongly neutron-rich environments, an intriguing alternative site for lanthanide production could in fact be robustly $\textit{proton-rich}$ matter outflows from core-collapse supernovae under specific conditions -- in particular, high-entropy winds with enhanced neutrino luminosity and fast dynamical timescales. In this environment, excess protons present after charged particle reactions have ceased can continue to be converted to neutrons by (anti-)neutrino interactions, producing a neutron capture reaction flow up to A~200. This scenario, christened the $\nu i$ process in a recent paper, has previously been discussed as a possibility. Here, we examine the prospects for $\nu i$ process through the lens of stellar abundance patterns, bolometric lightcurves, and galactic chemical evolution models, with a particular focus on hypernovae as candidate sites. We identify specific lanthanide signatures for which the $\nu i$ process can provide a credible alternative to $r$/$i$ processes.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Signatures of Supernova Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, , fainter and longer than previous 1D models. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</description>
