      <title>Unique continuation of Schr\"odinger-type equations for $\bar\partial$ II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our earlier unique continuation results \cite{PZ2} for the Schr\"odinger-type inequality $ |\bar\partial u| \le V|u|$ on a domain in $\mathbb C^n$ by removing the smoothness assumption on solutions $u = (u_1, \ldots, u_N)$. More specifically, we establish the unique continuation property for $W_{loc}^{1,1}$ solutions when the potential $V\in L_{loc}^p $, $ p&gt;2n$; and for $W_{loc}^{1,2n+\epsilon}$ solutions when $V\in L_{loc}^{2n}$ with $N=1$ or $n = 2$. Although the unique continuation property fails in general if $V\in L_{loc}^{p}, p&lt;2n$, we show that the property still holds for $W_{loc}^{1,1}$ solutions when $V $ is a small constant multiple of $ \frac{1}{|z|}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that for $0&lt;t&lt;p \le 1$, $\mu$ is a $p$-Carleson measure if and only if $id: \mathcal Q_t \mapsto \mathcal T_{p, 2}^2(\mu)$ is bounded. Our result shows that a "tiny-perturbed" version of a conjecture due to Liu, Lou, and Zhu is true.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Theory On Geodesic Balls Of Complete K\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Nevanlinna theory of meromorphic mappings from a geodesic ball of a general complete K\"ahler manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature into a complex projective manifold. When dimension of a target manifold is not greater than dimension of a source manifold, we establish a second main theorem which is a generalization of the classical second main theorem for a ball of $\mathbb C^m.$ In particular, if a source manifold is non-compact and it carries a positive global Green function, then one has a second main theorem for the whole source manifold. Consequently, we obtain a Picard's theorem.</description>

      <title>Injectivity theorems and cubical descent for schemes, stacks, and analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove relative injectivity, torsion-freeness, and vanishing theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs on schemes, algebraic stacks, formal schemes, semianalytic germs of complex analytic spaces, rigid analytic spaces, Berkovich spaces, and adic spaces locally of weakly finite type over a field, all in equal characteristic zero. We give a uniform proof for all these theorems in all the categories of spaces mentioned above, which were previously only known for varieties and complex analytic spaces due to work of Ambro and Fujino. Ambro and Fujino's results are integral in the proofs of the fundamental theorems of the minimal model program for (semi-)log canonical pairs and the theory of quasi-log structures. Our results resolve a significant barrier to extending these results on (semi-)log canonical pairs and quasi-log structures beyond the setting of varieties and complex analytic spaces.
  In order to prove our most general injectivity theorems, we generalize to all these categories of spaces a criterion due to Guill\'en and Navarro Aznar characterizing when functors defined on smooth varieties extend to all varieties. This extension result uses cubical hyperresolutions, which we construct in all categories of spaces mentioned above. Our extension result is very general and is of independent interest. We use this extension result to prove our injectivity theorems for generalized normal crossing pairs. We also apply our extension result to develop the theoretical foundations for the Deligne-Du Bois complex in these categories of spaces and to construct a weight filtration on the (pro-)\'etale cohomology of schemes and rigid analytic spaces. These results establish some aspects of Deligne-Hodge theory in all categories of spaces mentioned above.</description>

      <title>On boundary points of minimal continuously Hutchinson invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear differential operator $T=Q(z)\frac{d}{dz}+P(z)$ with polynomial coefficients defines a continuous family of Hutchinson operators when acting on the space of positive powers of linear forms. In this context, $T$ has a unique minimal Hutchinson-invariant set $M_{CH}^{T}$ in the complex plane. Using a geometric interpretation of its boundary in terms of envelops of certain families of rays, we subdivide this boundary into local and global arcs (the former being portions of integral curves of the rational vector field $\frac{Q(z)}{P(z)}\partial_{z}$), and singular points of different types which we classify below. The latter decomposition of the boundary of $M_{CH}^{T}$ is largely determined by its intersection with the plane algebraic curve formed by the inflection points of trajectories of the field $\frac{Q(z)}{P(z)}\partial_{z}$. We provide an upper bound for the number of local arcs in terms of degrees of $P$ and $Q$. As an application of our classification, we obtain a number of global geometric properties of minimal Hutchinson-invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of periodic points for loxodromic automorphisms of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. Finally, we extend the local arithmetic Hodge index theorem to a certain class of vertical adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties to conclude the proof.</description>

      <title>Difference "abc" theorem for entire functions and Difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the difference analogue of Stothers-Mason theorem for entire functions of order less than 1, which can be seen as difference $abc$ theorem for entire functions with slow growth. We also obtain the difference analogue of truncated version of Nevanlinna second main theorem which reveals that meromorphic functions which are of hyper order less than 1 except periodic functions with period one cannot have too many points with long height in the complex plane. Both theorems depend on new definitions of height of shifting poles and shifting zeros of a given meromorphic function in a domain.</description>

      <title>A note on composition operators on the bi-disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give a new sufficient condition for the boundedness of the composition operator on the Dirichlet-type space on the disc, via a two dimensional change of variables formula. With the same formula, we characterise the bounded composition operators on the anisotropic Dirichlet-type spaces $\mathfrak{D}_{\vec{a}}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ induced by holomorphic self maps of the bi-disc $\mathbb{D}^2$ of the form $\Phi(z_1,z_2)=(\phi_1(z_1),\phi_2(z_2))$. We also consider the problem of boundedness of composition operators $C_{\Phi}:A^2(\mathbb{D}^2) \to \mathfrak{D}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ for general self maps of the bi-disc, applying some recent results about Carleson measures on the the Dirichlet space of the bi-disc.</description>

      <title>Orbits of the left-right equivalence of maps in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The germs of maps (k^n,o)\to(k^p,o) are traditionally studied up to the right, left-right or contact equivalence. Various questions about the group-orbits are reduced to their tangent spaces. Classically the passage from the tangent spaces to the orbits was done by vector fields integration, hence it was bound to the real/complex-analytic or C^r-category.
  The purely-algebraic (characteristic-free) approach to the group-orbits of right and contact equivalence has been developed during the last decades. But those methods could not address the (essentially more complicated) left-right equivalence. Moreover, the characteristic-free results (in the right/contact cases) were weaker than those in characteristic zero, because of the (inevitable) pathologies of positive characteristic.
  In this paper we close these omissions.
  * We establish the general (characteristic-free) passage from the tangent spaces to the groups orbits for the groups of right, contact and let-right equivalence. Submodules of the tangent spaces ensure (shifted) submodules of the group-orbits.
  For the left-right equivalence this extends (and strengthens) various classical results of Mather, Gaffney, du Plessis, and others.
  * A filtration on the space of maps induces the filtration on the group and on the tangent space.
  We establish the criteria of type "$T_{G^{(j)}}f$ vs $G^{(j)} f$" in their strongest form, for arbitrary base field/ring, provided the characteristic is zero or high for a given map. This brings the "inevitably weaker" results of char&gt;0 to the level of char=0.
  * As an auxiliary step, important on its own, we develop the mixed-module structure of the tangent space to the left-right group and establish various properties of the annihilator ideal (that defines the instability locus of the map).</description>

      <title>Compact convergence, deformation of the $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$-complex and canonical $K$-homology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\gamma)$ be a compact, irreducible Hermitian complex space of complex dimension $m$ and with $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{sing}(X))=0$. Let $(F,\tau)\rightarrow X$ be a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle over $X$ and let us denote with $\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}$ the rolled-up operator of the maximal $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex of $F$-valued $(m,\bullet)$-forms. Let $\pi:M\rightarrow X$ be a resolution of singularities, $g$ a metric on $M$, $E:=\pi^*F$ and $\rho:=\pi^*\tau$. In this paper, under quite general assumptions on $\tau$, we prove the following equality of analytic $K$-homology classes $[\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}]=\pi_*[\overline{\eth}_{E,m}]$, with $\overline{\eth}_{E,m}$ the rolled-up operator of the $L^2$-$\overline{\partial}$ complex of $E$-valued $(m,\bullet)$-forms on $M$. Our proof is based on functional analytic techniques developed in \cite{KuSh} and provides an explicit homotopy between the even unbounded Fredholm modules induced by $\overline{\eth}_{F,m,\mathrm{abs}}$ and $\overline{\eth}_{E,m}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture in [9] we prove that the K\"ahler cone over a regular complete Sasakian manifold is Ricci-flat and projectively induced if and only if it is flat. We also obtain that, up to $\mathcal D_a$-homothetic transformations, K\"ahler cones over homogeneous compact Sasakian manifolds are projectively induced. As main tool we provide a relation between the K\"ahler potentials of the transverse K\"ahler metric and of the cone metric.</description>

      <title>Volterra operator acting on Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their introduction in 1997, the Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series have been broadly and deeply studied. The increasing interest sparked by these Banach spaces of Dirichlet series motivated the introduction of new such spaces, as the Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series $\mathcal{A}^p_{\mu}$ here considered, where $\mu$ is a probability measure on $(0,\infty)$. Similarly, recent lines of research have focused their attention on the study of some classical operators acting on these spaces, as it is the case of the Volterra operator $T_g$. In this work, we introduce a new family of Bloch spaces of Dirichlet series, the $\text{Bloch}_{\mu}$-spaces, and study some of its most essential properties. Using these spaces we are able to provide a sufficient condition for the Volterra operator $T_g$ to act boundedly on the Bergman spaces $\mathcal{A}^p_{\mu}$. We also establish a necessary condition for a specific choice of the probability measures $\mu$. Sufficient and necessary conditions for compactness are also proven. The membership in Schatten classes is studied as well. Eventually, a radicality result is established for Bloch spaces of Dirichlet series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sz\'asz inequality is a classical result providing a bound for polynomials with zeros in the upper half of the complex plane in terms of its low-order coefficients. Some generalisations of this result to polynomials in several variables were done by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Knese. In this article the inequality is discussed in the context of matrix polynomials and matrix variables. As a byproduct we improve the scalar Sz\'asz inequality by relaxing the assumption of the location of zeros.</description>
