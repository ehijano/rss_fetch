      <title>Will shifted and truncated Maxwellian EVDF near the wall exhibit different electron currents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments to explore the predicted consequences on the I-V characteristics of a Langmuir probe based on the fluid approach for electrons and the electron Bohm criterion are conducted and their results are presented. The predictions on the I-V characteristics of a Langmuir probe when electrons are highly collisional are shown in terms of the estimation of plasma potentials and electron saturation currents, primarily represented by a rounded knee of the curve. An edge-effect reduced and guard-ringed Langmuir probe is employed to minimize geometrical effects on the measured data. To characterize the rounded knee of the curve, various methods on defining critical points around the plasma potential are presented. Additionally, emissive and cutoff probes were utilized to obtain bulk plasma properties, providing accurate reference plasma parameters. The physically valid condition for electrons to exhibit a shifted Maxwellian velocity distribution near the wall, wherein the fluid approach is applicable, is established from theory of the ion-acoustic instability enhanced electron-electron collisions. In this work, we conducted experiments scanning from collisionless to collisional regimes for electrons with theoretical considerations. Our observation indicate that the Langmuir probe can be understood with the conventional wisdom represented by the model of truncated electron velocity distribution. This result suggests the absence of the enhancement of electron-electron collisions and/or incompleteness of electron fluid approach near the wall.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>

      <title>Quench Risk Increase With Irradiation Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting material enables fusion reactor magnet concepts to operate with current densities that would melt materials with non-zero resistance. The application of superconducting material is considered essential for net-positive power machines. Catastrophic damage can occur when superconductivity is lost and the current generates heat. This scenario is called a quench. Stabilizer material carries the magnet current (typically copper) during a quench and is the focus of this work. Irradiation-induced defects store energy in the Cu crystalline lattice. The release of stored energy in the magnet materials, combined with the associated magnet material property changes, can cause extreme off-normal events in superconducting magnets that worsen with fluence at an increasing rate. Stored energy can be released causing local heating and increasing the risk of a quench. For example, following irradiation at 4.6K and an estimated fluence of 0.45*10^18 n/cm^2, an energy release of 0.023 J/g was measured from Cu when increased in temperature from 10K to 18K, which would have been enough energy to create the same temperature increase spontaneously. Extrapolations of experimental data are used to estimate when spontaneous heating can occur due to the release of energy stored in irradiation-induced defects. Critical fluence values are estimated between 1.74*10^18 n/cm^2 and 2.85*10^19 n/cm^2 for neutron irradiation of Cu at a temperature of 20K. High-temperature ramp rate in-situ cryogenic calorimetry experiments of magnet materials following irradiation would provide more clarity to designers of fusion magnet systems. Due to the increased quench risk with superconducting magnet dose, magnetic confinement reactor designers should consider the frequency of maintenance temperature cycles to maintain an appropriate level of risk during operation.</description>

      <title>Advanced methods for analyzing in-situ observations of magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ample evidence for magnetic reconnection in the solar system, but it is a nontrivial task to visualize, to determine the proper approaches and frames to study, and in turn to elucidate the physical processes at work in reconnection regions from in-situ measurements of plasma particles and electromagnetic fields. Here an overview is given of a variety of single- and multi-spacecraft data analysis techniques that are key to revealing the context of in-situ observations of magnetic reconnection in space and for detecting and analyzing the diffusion regions where ions and/or electrons are demagnetized. We focus on recent advances in the era of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, which has made electron-scale, multi-point measurements of magnetic reconnection in and around Earth's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Evolution of secondary electron spectrum during cosmic-ray discharge in the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recently found that streaming cosmic rays (CRs) induce a resistive electric field that can accelerate secondary electrons produced by CR ionization. In this work, we study the evolution of the energy spectrum of secondary electrons by numerically solving the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation and Ohm's law. We show that the accelerated secondary electrons further ionize a gas, that is, the electron avalanche occurs, resulting in increased ionization and excitation of the gas. Although the resistive electric field becomes weaker than one before the CR discharge, the weak resistive electric field weakly accelerates the secondary electrons. The quasi-steady state is almost independent of the initial resistive electric field, but depends on the electron fraction in the gas. The resistive electric field in the quasi-steady state is larger for the higher electron fraction, which makes the number of secondary electrons that can ionize the gas larger, resulting in a higher ionization rate. The CR discharge could explain the high ionization rate that are observed in some molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of High-Efficiency Microwave Heating Producing Record Highly Charged Xenon Ion Beams with Superconducting ECR Ion Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intense highly charged ion beam production is essential for high-power heavy ion accelerators. A novel movable Vlasov launcher for superconducting high charge state Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) ion source has been devised that can affect the microwave power effectiveness by a factor of about 4 in terms of highly charged ion beam production. This approach based on a dedicated microwave launching system instead of the traditional coupling scheme has led to new insight on microwave-plasma interaction. With this new understanding, the world record highly charged xenon ion beam currents have been enhanced by up to a factor of 2, which could directly and significantly enhance the performance of heavy ion accelerators and provide many new research opportunities in nuclear physics, atomic physics and other disciplines.</description>
