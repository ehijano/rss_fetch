      <title>Uncovering Stealth Bias in LISA observations of Double White Dwarf Binaries due to Tidal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double white dwarfs are important gravitational wave sources for LISA, as they are some of the most numerous compact systems in our universe. Here we consider finite-sized effects due to tidal interactions, as they are expected to have a measurable impact on these systems. Previous studies suggested that tidal effects would allow the individual masses to be measured, but there was a subtle error in those analyses. Using a fully Bayesian analysis we find that while tidal effects do not allow us to constrain the individual masses, they do yield informative lower bounds on the total mass of the system. Including tidal effects is crucial to the accuracy of our estimation of the chirp and total mass. Neglecting tidal effects leads to significant biases towards higher chirp masses, and we see that the lower bound of the total masses is biased towards a higher value as well. For many systems observed by LISA, tidal effects can lead to a "stealth" bias, since only the first derivative of the frequency can be measured. To separate tidal effects from the usual point particle decay we need to be able to measure the change in the second derivative of the frequency cause by the tides. This can only be done for high frequency systems observed with high signal-to-noise. The bias, if not accounted for, can have significant astrophysical implications; for example, it could lead to an incorrect estimation of the population of potential Type IA supernovae progenitors.</description>

      <title>Sloshing Cold Fronts in Galaxy Cluster Abell 2566</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the environment of a cool core cluster Abell 2566 (redshift $z$ = 0.08247) based on the analysis of 20 ks Chandra X-ray data. 2D imaging analysis of the Chandra data from this cluster revealed spiral structures in the morphology of X-ray emission from within the central 109 kpc formed due to gas sloshing. This analysis also witness sharp edges in the surface brightness distribution along the south-east and north-west of the X-ray peaks at 41.6 kpc and 77.4 kpc, respectively. Spectral analysis of 0.5 - 7 keV X-ray photons along these discontinuities exhibited sharp temperature jumps from 2.3 to 3.1 keV and 1.8 to 2.8 keV, respectively, with consistency in the pressure profiles, implying their association with cold fronts due to gas sloshing of the gas. Further confirmation for such an association was provided by the deprojected broken power-law density function fit to the surface brightness distribution along these wedge shaped sectorial regions. This study also witness an offset of 4.6 arcsec (6.8 kpc) between the BCG and the X-ray peak, and interaction of the BCG with a sub-system in the central region, pointing towards the origin of the spiral structure due to a minor merger.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Formula for the Multiple Scattering of Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of photons that are multiply scattered in relativistic flows, under the assumption of isotropic and inelastic scattering. These expressions characterize the collective dynamics of these photons, ranging from free-streaming to diffusion regions. The PDF, defined within the light cone to ensure the preservation of causality, is expressed in a three-dimensional space at a constant time surface. This expression is achieved by summing the PDFs of photons that have been scattered $n$ times within four-dimensional spacetime. We have confirmed that this formulation accurately reproduces the results of relativistic Monte Carlo simulations.We found that the PDF in three-dimensional space at a constant time surface can be represented in a separable variable form. We demonstrate the behavior of the PDF in the laboratory frame across a wide range of Lorentz factors for the relativistic flow. When the Lorentz factor of the fluid is low, the behavior of scattered photons evolves sequentially from free propagation to diffusion, and then to dynamic diffusion, where the mean effective velocity of the photons equates to that of the fluid. On the other hand, when the Lorentz factor is large, the behavior evolves from anisotropic ballistic motion, characterized by a mean effective velocity approaching the speed of light, to dynamic diffusion.</description>

      <title>Changing Look of the optical spectrum of the MeV Blazar PKS 0446+112 (4FGL J0449.1+1121)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the high activity of the gamma-ray Fermi source 4FGL J0449.1+1121 (PKS 0446+112), possibly associated with a IceCube neutrino event IC-240105A, we obtained optical spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the counterpart. We detect a clear emission line at 3830 Ang identified as Ly$\alpha$ that confirms the redshift of source at z=2.153. Comparing with previous spectroscopy, we find an increase of the continuum by a factor $\sim$10, and a significant decrease of the CIV 1550 emission line flux by a factor $\sim$5. This produces a dramatic drop of the Equivalent Width from $\sim$20 Ang to 0.8 Ang, which is suggestive of a very high jet activity. The Full Width Half Maximum of the emission lines are midway (1000 - 2000 km/s) between those typical of the broad and narrow regions of quasars. Based on this, the source classification is intermediate between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar and BL Lac object.</description>

      <title>Pulse Profile Modelling of Thermonuclear Burst Oscillations III : Constraining the properties of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling (PPM) is a comprehensive relativistic ray-tracing technique employed to determine the properties of neutron stars. In this study, we apply this technique to the Type I X-ray burster and accretion-powered millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338, extracting its fundamental properties using PPM of its thermonuclear burst oscillations. Using data from its 2003 outburst, and a single uniform temperature hot spot model, we infer XTE J1814-338 to be located at a distance of $7.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ kpc, with a mass of $1.21^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and an equatorial radius of $7.0^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km. Our results also offer insight into the time evolution of the hot spot but point to some potential shortcomings of the single uniform temperature hot spot model. We explore the implications of this result, including what we can learn about thermonuclear burst oscillation mechanisms and the importance of modelling the accretion contribution to the emission during the burst.</description>

      <title>Passage of a Gamma-Ray Burst Through a Molecular Cloud: Cloud Ionization Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model is constructed of the propagation of gamma-ray burst radiation through a dense molecular cloud. The main processes of the interaction of the radiation with the interstellar gas are taken into account in the simulations: the ionization of H and He atoms, the ionization of metal ions and the emission of Auger electrons, the photoionization and the photodissociation of H$_2$ molecules, the absorption of ultraviolet radiation via Lyman and Werner band transitions of H$_2$, the thermal sublimation of dust grains. The ionization of metal ions by X-ray radiation determines the gas ionization fraction in the cloud region, where the gas is predominantly neutral. The ionization of inner electron shells of ions is accompanied by the emission of Auger electrons, giving rise to metal ions in a high ionization state. In particular, the column densities of Mg, Si, Fe in the ionization states I$-$IV are much lower than the column densities of these ions in the ionization state V and higher. The photoionization of metal ions by ultraviolet radiation takes place at distances smaller than the dust-destruction radius and only for neutral atoms with an ionization threshold below 13.6 eV. The simulations have confirmed the previously made suggestion that the ionization of He atoms plays an important role in the absorption of radiation in the X-ray wavelength range. For a low metallicity, $\rm [M/H] \leq -1$, the role of He atoms is dominant.</description>

      <title>Constraining possible $\gamma$-ray burst emission from GW230529 using Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW230529 is the first compact binary coalescence detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration with at least one component mass confidently in the lower mass-gap, corresponding to the range 3-5$M_{\odot}$. If interpreted as a neutron star-black hole merger, this event has the most symmetric mass ratio detected so far and therefore has a relatively high probability of producing electromagnetic (EM) emission. However, no EM counterpart has been reported. At the merger time $t_0$, Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM together covered 100$\%$ of the sky. Performing a targeted search in a time window $[t_0-20 \text{s},t_0+20 \text{s}]$, we report no detection by the Swift-BAT and the Fermi-GBM instruments. Combining the position-dependent $\gamma-$ray flux upper limits and the gravitational-wave posterior distribution of luminosity distance, sky localization and inclination angle of the binary, we derive constraints on the characteristic luminosity and structure of the jet possibly launched during the merger. Assuming a top-hat jet structure, we exclude at 90$\%$ credibility the presence of a jet which has at the same time an on-axis isotropic luminosity $\gtrsim 10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$, in the bolometric band 1 keV-10 MeV, and a jet opening angle $\gtrsim 15$ deg. Similar constraints are derived testing other assumptions about the jet structure profile. Excluding GRB 170817A, the luminosity upper limits derived here are below the luminosity of any GRB observed so far.</description>

      <title>A Novel Model for the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been considered potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; with energy $\gtrsim 10^{18} {\rm~eV}$). In this work, we propose a novel model generating MeV emission lines in GRB, which can constrain the properties of heavy nuclei that potentially exist in GRB jets. Specifically, we find that relativistic hydrogen-like high-atomic-number ions originating from the $\beta$ decay of unstable nuclei and/or the recombination entrained in the GRB jet can generate narrow MeV emission lines through the de-excitation of excited-electrons. This model can successfully explain the MeV emission line observed in the most luminous GRB ever recorded, GRB~221009A, with suitable parameters including a Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 820-1700$ and a total mass of heavy nuclei $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^{23} - 10^{26}$~g. Especially, the emission line broadening can be reasonably attributed to both the expansion of the jet shell and the thermal motion of nuclei, naturally resulting in a narrow width ($\sigma_{\rm line} / E_{\rm line} \lesssim 0.2$) consistent with the observation. Furthermore, we predict that different GRBs can exhibit lines in different bands with various evolving behaviors, which might be confirmed with further observations. Finally, our model provides indirect evidence that GRBs may be one of the sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Radiation from the Interaction between Magnetar Bursts and Companion Star in a Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are young, highly magnetized neutron stars that are associated with magnetar short bursts (MSBs), magnetar giant flares (MGFs), and at least a part of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this work, we consider that a magnetar and a main sequence star are in a binary system and analyze the properties of the electromagnetic signals generated by the interaction between the magnetar bursts and the companion star. During the pre-burst period, the persistent radiation could be generated by the interaction between the $e^+e^-$-pair wind from the magnetar and the companion or its stellar wind. We find that for a newborn magnetar, the pre-burst persistent radiation from the strong magnetar wind can be dominant, and it is mainly at the optical and ultraviolet (UV) bands. For relatively older magnetars, the reemission from a burst interacting with the companion is larger than the pre-burst persistent radiation and the luminosity of the companion itself. The transient reemission produced by the heating process has a duration of $0.1 - 10^5 {\rm~s}$ at the optical, UV, and X-ray bands. Additionally, we find that if these phenomena occur in nearby galaxies within a few hundred kiloparsecs, they could be detected by current or future optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>Expected Gamma-Ray Burst Detection Rates and Redshift Distributions for the BlackCAT CubeSat Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive set of simulations exploring the sensitivity of the BlackCAT CubeSat to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BlackCAT is a NASA APRA-funded CubeSat mission for the detection and real-time sub-arcminute localization of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 3.5$) GRBs. Thanks to their luminous and long-lived afterglow emissions, GRBs are uniquely valuable probes of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium. In addition, each detected GRB with a known redshift serves to localize a region of high-redshift star formation in three dimensions, enabling deep follow-on searches for host galaxies and associated local and large-scale structure. We explore two distinct models for the GRB redshift distribution and luminosity function, both consistent with \textit{Swift} observations. We find that, for either model, BlackCAT is expected to detect a mean of 42 bursts per year on-orbit, with 6.7% to 10% of these at $z&gt;3.5$. BlackCAT bursts will be localized to $r_{90} \lesssim 55^{\prime\prime}$ precision and reported to the community within seconds. Due to the mission orbit and pointing scheme, bursts will be located in the night sky and well-placed for deep multiwavelength follow-up observations. BlackCAT is on schedule to achieve launch readiness in 2025.</description>

      <title>The unluckiest star: A spectroscopically confirmed repeated partial tidal disruption event AT 2022dbl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unluckiest star orbits a supermassive black hole elliptically. Every time it reaches the pericenter, it shallowly enters the tidal radius and gets partially tidal disrupted, producing a series of flares. Confirmation of a repeated partial tidal disruption event (pTDE) requires not only evidence to rule out other types of transients, but also proof that only one star is involved, as TDEs from multiple stars can also produce similar flares. In this letter, we report the discovery of a repeated pTDE, AT 2022dbl. In a quiescent galaxy at z=0.0284, two separate optical/UV flares have been observed in 2022 and 2024, with no bright X-ray, radio or mid-infrared counterparts. Compared to the first flare, the second flare has a similar blackbody temperature of ~26,000 K, slightly lower peak luminosity, and slower rise and fall phases. Compared to the ZTF TDEs, their blackbody parameters, bolometric energies and light curve shapes are all similar. The spectra taken during the second flare show a steeper continuum than the late-time spectra of the previous flare, consistent with a newly risen flare. More importantly, the possibility of two independent TDEs can be largely ruled out because the optical spectra taken around the peak of the two flares exhibit highly similar broad Balmer, N III and possible He II emission lines, especially the extreme ~4100{\AA} emission lines. This represents the first robust spectroscopic evidence for a repeated pTDE, which can soon be verified by observing the third flare, given its short orbital period.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: simulations in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present self-consistent numerical simulations in general relativity of putative primordial black holes inside neutron stars. Complementing a companion paper in which we assumed the black hole mass $m$ to be much smaller than the mass $M_*$ of the neutron star, thereby justifying a point-mass treatment, we here consider black holes with masses large enough so that their effect on the neutron star cannot be neglected. We develop and employ several new numerical techniques, including initial data describing boosted black holes in neutron-star spacetimes, a relativistic determination of the escape speed, and a gauge condition that keeps the black hole hole at a fixed coordinate location. We then perform numerical simulations that highlight different aspects of the capture of primordial black holes by neutron stars. In particular, we simulate the initial passage of the black hole through the star, demonstrating that the neutron star remains dynamically stable provided the black-hole mass is sufficiently small, $m \lesssim 0.05 M_*$. We also model the late evolution of a black hole oscillating about the center of an initially stable neutron star while accreting stellar mass and ultimately triggering gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>The role of the irreducible mass in repetitive Penrose energy extraction processes in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of the irreducible mass ($M_{\rm irr}$) has led to the mass-energy ($M$) formula of a Kerr-Newman black hole (BH), in turn leading to an expression for its surface area $S=16\pi M_{\rm irr}^2$. This allowed as well the coeval identification of the reversible and irreversible transformations. The concepts of \textit{extracted} and \textit{extractable} energy soon followed. This new conceptual framework avoids inconsistencies recently evidenced in a repetitive Penrose process. We consider repetitive decays in the ergosphere of an initially extreme Kerr BH and show that these processes are highly irreversible. For each decay, including the BH capture of the particle falling into the horizon, the increase of the irreducible mass is much larger than the extracted energy. Correspondingly, the horizon radius increases. The energy extraction process saturates and stops when the horizon reaches the decay radius. Thus, reaching a final non-rotating Schwarzschild BH state by this accretion process is impossible. We have assessed such processes for three selected decay radii, $r= 1.2 M$, $1.5 M$, and $1.9 M$. The energy extracted until saturation is only $2.75\%$, $4.54\%$, and $2.45\%$ of the BH initial mass, while the extractable energy is reduced by $25\%$, $56\%$, and $92\%$. The BH rotational energy is mostly converted into irreducible mass, which increases to $75\%$, $83\%$, and $95\%$ of the initial BH mass. Therefore, evaluating the effect of the irreducible mass increase in the energy extraction processes in the Kerr BH ergosphere is now mandatory.</description>

      <title>KG-oscillators in Som-Raychaudhuri rotating cosmic string spacetime in a mixed magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a G\"{o}% del-type Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime in a mixed magnetic field (given by the vector potential $A_{\mu }=\left( 0,0,A_{\varphi },0\right) $, with $% A_{\varphi }=B_{1}r^{2}/2+B_{2}r$). The resulting KG equation takes a Schr% \"{o}dinger-like form (with an oscillator plus a linear plus a Coulomb-like interactions potential) that admits a solution in the form of biconfluent Heun functions/series $H_{B}\left( \alpha ,\beta ,\gamma ,\delta ,z\right) $% . The usual power series expansion of which is truncated to a polynomial of \ order $n_{r}+1=n\geq 1$ through the usual condition $\gamma =2\left( n_{r}+1\right) +\alpha $. However, we use the very recent recipe suggested by Mustafa \cite{1.29} as an alternative parametric condition/correlation. i.e., $\delta =-\beta \left( 2n_{r}+\alpha +3\right) $, to facilitate conditional exact solvability of the problem. We discuss and report the effects of the mixed magnetic field as well as the effects of the G\"{o}del-type SR-spacetime background on the KG-oscillators' spectroscopic structure.</description>

      <title>One- and two-argument equation of state parametrizations with continuous sound speed for neutron star simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe two fitting schemes that aim to represent the high-density part of realistic equations of state for numerical simulations such as neutron star oscillations. The low-density part of the equation of state is represented by an arbitrary polytropic crust, and we propose a generic procedure to stitch any desired crust to the high-density fit, which is performed on the internal energy, pressure and sound speed of barotropic equations of state that describe cold neutron stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. An extension of the fitting schemes to equations of state with an additional compositional argument is proposed. In particular we develop a formalism that ensures the existence of a $\beta$-equilibrium at low densities. An additional feature of this low-density model is that it can be, in principle, applied to any parametrization. The performance of the fits is checked on mass, radius and tidal deformability as well as on the dynamical radial oscillation frequencies. To that end, we use a pseudospectral isolated neutron star evolution code based on a non-conservative form of the hydrodynamical equations. A comparison to existing parametrizations is proposed, as far as possible, and to published radial frequency values in the literature. The static and dynamic quantities are well reproduced by the fitting schemes. Our results suggest that, even though the radius is very sensitive to the choice of the crust, this choice has little influence on the oscillation frequencies of a neutron star.</description>

      <title>Quasi-universal relations in the context of future neutron star detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equation of state dependence of neutron star's astrophysical features modeling is key to our understanding of dense matter. However, there exists a series of almost equation-of-state independent relations reported in the literature, called quasi-universal relations, that are used to determine neutron star radii and moments of inertia from X-ray and gravitational wave signals. Using sets of equations of state constrained by multi-messenger astronomy measurements and nuclear-physics theory, we discuss quasi-universal relations in the context of future gravitational-wave detectors Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and X-ray detector STROBE-X. We focus on relations that involve the moment of inertia $I$, the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ and the compactness $C$: $C(\Lambda)$, $I(\Lambda)$ and $I(C)$. The quasi-universal fits and their associated errors are constructed with three different microphysics approaches which include state of the art nuclear physics theory and astrophysical constraints. Gravitational-wave and X-ray signals are simulated with the sensitivity of the next generation of detectors. Equation of state inference on those simulated signals is performed to assess if quasi-universal relations will offer a better precision on the extraction of neutron star's macroscopic parameters than equation of state dependent relations. We show that detections with the 3rd generation of gravitational wave detectors and the X-ray detector STROBE-X will be sensitive to the fit error marginalization technique. We also find that the sensitivity of those detectors will be sufficient that using full equation of state distributions will offer better precision on extracted parameters than quasi-universal relations.We also note that nuclear physics theory offers a more pronounced equation of state invariance of quasi-universal relations than current astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ejecta Temperature and Mass on the Strength of Heavy Element Signatures in Kilonovae</title>

Abstract: A kilonova, the electromagnetic emission produced by compact binary mergers, is formed through a delicate interplay of physical processes, involving r-process nucleosynthesis and interactions between heavy elements and photons through radiative transfer. This complexity makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive understanding of kilonova spectra. In this study, we aim to enhance our understanding and establish connections between physical parameters and observables through radiative-transfer simulations. Specifically, we investigate how ejecta temperature and element mass influence the resulting kilonova spectrum. For each species, the strength of its line features depends on these parameters, leading to the formation of a distinct region in the parameter space, dubbed the Resonance Island, where the line signature of that species is notably evident in the kilonova spectrum. We explore its origin and applications. Among explored r-process elements (31$\leq$Z$\leq$92), we find that four species -- Sr$_{\rm II}$, Y$_{\rm II}$, Ba$_{\rm II}$, and Ce$_{\rm II}$ -- exhibit large and strong resonance islands, suggesting their significant contributions to kilonova spectra at specific wavelengths. In addition, we discuss potential challenges and future perspectives in observable heavy elements and their masses in the context of the resonance island.</description>

      <title>Scattering model of scintillation arcs in pulsar secondary spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic spectra of pulsars frequently exhibit diverse interference patterns, often associated with parabolic arcs in the Fourier-transformed (secondary) spectra. Our approach differs from previous ones in two ways: first, we extend beyond the traditional Fresnel-Kirchhoff method by using the Green's function of the Helmholtz equation, i.e.\ we consider spherical waves originating from three dimensional space, not from a two dimensional screen. Secondly, the discrete structures observed in the secondary spectrum result from discrete scatterer configurations, namely plasma concentrations in the interstellar medium, and not from the selection of points by the stationary phase approximation. Through advanced numerical techniques, we model both the dynamic and secondary spectra, providing a comprehensive framework that describes all components of the latter spectra in terms of physical quantities. Additionally, we provide a thorough analytical explanation of the secondary spectrum.</description>

      <title>Stochastic acceleration in Extreme TeV BL Lacs through MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme TeV BL Lacs are a class of blazars with unique spectral and temporal features, not easily reproducible using standard one-zone models based on single shock acceleration. To account for their peculiar properties we elaborated a two-steps acceleration model where a recollimation shock and the subsequent downstream turbulence energize non-thermal electrons. We apply the model to a sample of Extreme TeV BL Lacs with well characterized spectral energy distributions. Since we are considering several sources, we automatized the exploration of the parameter space. This also allows us to derive the parameter distributions and to study the correlations among them. We numerically solved a system of two coupled non-linear differential equations to obtain the non-thermal particles and turbulence spectra. We calculated the spectral energy distribution via the Synchrotron Self-Compton emission model. The automatization of the parameter space exploration is possible through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler, in our case emcee. We derived well defined posterior distributions for the parameters, showing that the model is well constrained by available data and supporting the suitability of our method. The cross-correlations among some of the physical parameters are not trivial, therefore we conclude that MCMC sampling is a key instrument to characterize the complexity of our multi-parametric phenomenological model.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from runaway mergers and accretion in nuclear star clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid formation of supermassive black holes occurs in dense nuclear star clusters that are initially gas-dominated. Stellar-mass black hole remnants of the most massive cluster sink into the core, where a massive runaway black hole forms as a consequence of combined effects of repeated mergers and Eddington-limited gas accretion. The associated gravitational wave signals of high-redshift extreme mass-ratio inspirals are a unique signature of the nuclear star cluster scenario.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and polarization-dependent lensing of gravitational waves in strong gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propagation of gravitational waves can be described in terms of null geodesics by using the geometrical optics approximation. However, at large but finite frequencies the propagation is affected by the spin-orbit coupling corrections to geometrical optics, known as the gravitational spin Hall effect. Consequently, gravitational waves follow slightly different frequency- and polarization-dependent trajectories, leading to dispersive and birefringent phenomena. We study the potential for detecting the gravitational spin Hall effect in hierarchical triple black hole systems, consisting of an emitting binary orbiting a more massive body acting as a gravitational lens. We calculate the difference in time of arrival with respect to the geodesic propagation and find that it follows a simple power-law dependence on frequency with a fixed exponent. We calculate the gravitational spin Hall-corrected waveform and its mismatch with respect to the original waveform. The waveform carries a measurable imprint of the strong gravitational field if the source, lens, and observer are sufficiently aligned, or for generic observers if the source is close enough to the lens. We present constraints on dispersive time delays from GWTC-3, translated from limits on Lorentz invariance violation. Finally, we address the sensitivity of current and future ground detectors to dispersive lensing. Our results demonstrate that the gravitational spin Hall effect can be detected, providing a novel probe of general relativity and the environments of compact binary systems.</description>
