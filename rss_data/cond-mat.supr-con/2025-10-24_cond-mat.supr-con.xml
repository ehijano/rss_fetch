      <title>Quantum geometry and impurity sensitivity of superconductors without time-reversal symmetry: application to rhombohedral graphene and altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted (anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the former effects lead to "quantum geometric pair breaking", where any superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities, and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Correlation between magnetism and lattice dynamics for cubic FeGe under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20 FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation (ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements. This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements, presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where nesting plays a more dominating role.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films, aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized $\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.</description>

      <title>Soft Phonon Charge-Density Wave Formation in the Kagome Metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature electron dephasing rates indicate magnetic disorder in superconducting TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism. The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films. Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.</description>

      <title>A transmon qubit realized by exploiting the superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device, here referred to as the `quasicharge qubit'. Operating such a protected qubit requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have gate speeds of the same order. The simulation of the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy is the key novelty of this work. We also characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise using Fermi's golden rule. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic, side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the low-energy band structure.</description>

      <title>Charge-density waves and stripes in quarter metals of graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$ symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413 (2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal, generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.</description>
