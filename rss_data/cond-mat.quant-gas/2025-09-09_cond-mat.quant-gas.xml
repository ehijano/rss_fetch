      <title>Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin 1/2 particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin--orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</description>

      <title>Different Phases in a Dissipative Rydberg Lattice : Roles of Occupancy and On-site Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength, the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information as a Measure of Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking underlies diverse phenomena from phase transitions in condensed matter to fundamental interactions in gauge theories. Despite many proposed indicators, a general quantification of symmetry breaking that is faithful, computable, and valid in the thermodynamic limit has remained elusive. Here, within quantum resource theory, we propose the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as such a measure. We demonstrate its utility by computing QFI for paradigmatic models: in the BCS superconductor, the QFI counts the number of Cooper pairs; in the transverse-field XY spin chains, it captures topological phase transition that has no local order parameter; and in quantum quench dynamics, it allows us to exactly derive the microscopic origin and conditions of the quantum Mpemba effect in terms of excitation propagation, including in the thermodynamic limit--beyond the reach of previous analyses. Our results show that the QFI, which is a complete resource monotone in the resource theory of asymmetry that plays the role of entanglement entropy in entanglement theory, faithfully captures symmetry breaking in condensed-matter systems. These results highlight the QFI as a universal and physically meaningful diagnostic of symmetry breaking in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tunneling resonances through periodically driven quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Network Framework for Lindbladian Spectra and Steady States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.</description>

      <title>Continuous cloud position spectroscopy using a magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a continuous spectroscopy technique with frequency sensitivity well below the natural transition linewidth, while maintaining a locking range hundreds of times larger. The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser, we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to long-term frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Entropic Time in a Tabletop Wheeler-DeWitt Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by experiments of interacting quantum gases across high partial wave resonance, we investigated the thermodynamic properties as well as single particle spectrums of Bose gases in normal phase for different interaction strengths both for $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. The equation of state, contact density, momentum distributions, and self-energies of single particle Green's functions are obtained in the spirit of ladder diagram approximations. Radio frequency (RF) spectrum, as an important experimental approach to detect Feshbach molecules or interaction effect, is calculated at different temperatures. A reversed temperature dependence on the BEC side and BCS side is identified for both $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. An estimation for the signal of RF spectra under typical experimental conditions is also provided.</description>

Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a coherent terahertz radiation source based on Bose-Einstein condensate of incoherently pumped microcavity photons. Energy relaxation is provided by inelastic photon scattering on a two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic field. The proposed setup evades the standard lasing mechanisms: neither population inversion nor light wave amplification is utilized. We study the kinetics of photon condensation and describe a semiconductor-crystal based device.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel phase of periodically driven matter that exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations without requiring disorder. However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed ``unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals'' (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform/staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of $\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated Fourier-space phase mask.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are intriguing transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm which are usually identified by the appearance of a continuous phase transition between locally ordered phases. Here, we reveal the presence of deconfined quantum critical points with unexplored properties. Contrary to previously known examples, we show that the phenomenon of spin-charge separation peculiar to interacting low dimensional fermions can allow for the appearance of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. We first infer this point by performing a field theory analysis of generic one-dimensional fermionic systems in the low energy limit. Subsequently, we derive a microscopic model where phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can take place. Here, by performing a numerical analysis we explicitly derive, among others, the gaps, local order parameters and correlation functions behavior, supporting the presence of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. Our results thus provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>
