      <title>Laser-cut Patterned, Micrometer-thin Diamond Membranes with Coherent Color Centers for Open Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers suitable for applications in quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Control of Diamond Color Center Charge States via Surface Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and -energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-Photon Correlations from a Purcell-enhanced Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Coupled to an Open Microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 % per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations. Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum computing with qudit stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits (high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based quantum computing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering effective Hamiltonians is essential for advancing quantum technologies including quantum simulation, sensing, and computing. This paper presents a general framework for effective Hamiltonian engineering, enabling robust, accurate, and efficient quantum control strategies. To achieve efficiency, we focus on creating target zeroth-order effective Hamiltonians while minimizing higher-order contribution and enhancing robustness against systematic errors. The control design identifies the minimal subspace of the toggling-frame Hamiltonian and the full set of achievable, zeroth-order, effective Hamiltonians. Examples are included to illustrate the process flow and resultant precision and robustness.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian thermal reservoirs for autonomous entanglement distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source. While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced. We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits in a phononic quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Improvements in Quantum Algorithms for Linear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form $\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for \textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these findings provide a 110x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Observing High-dimensional Nonlocality using Multi-Outcome Spectral Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit. Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum information protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state. This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic ImF instanton rate theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory. We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate theory.</description>

      <title>Free Electron Paths from Dirac's Wave Equation Elucidating Zitterbewegung and Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the widespread belief that Dirac's wave equation does not exhibit electron paths, they are hiding in plain sight. The worldline of a free electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function whose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz transformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic motion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the ultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\omega_0$ found by Schr\"{o}dinger in his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the \emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition of Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents are due to the zitter motion. In an inertial "rest"-frame fixed at the inertia center, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified direction implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent perpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius $c/\omega_0 = \hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to this spin direction. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the electro-magnetic potential. This analysis confirms the nature of ZBW directly from Dirac's equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck, Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical electron models. Furthermore, these five classical models are equivalent and express the same free electron dynamics as Dirac's equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving nuclear resonances, which is based on the iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and eigenvector continuation with complex scaling. To validate this approach, we compute the resonant states of $\alpha-\alpha$ system and achieve results in good agreement with traditional methods. Our study offers a new perspective on calculating eigenvalues of non-Hermitian operators and lays some groundwork for further exploration of nuclear resonances using quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Theorems for the Equivalence of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (Extended)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many promising quantum algorithms in economics, medical science, and material science rely on circuits that are parameterized by a large number of angles. To ensure that these algorithms are efficient, these parameterized circuits must be heavily optimized. However, most quantum circuit optimizers are not verified, so this procedure is known to be error-prone. For this reason, there is growing interest in the design of equivalence checking algorithms for parameterized quantum circuits. In this paper, we define a generalized class of parameterized circuits with arbitrary rotations and show that this problem is decidable for cyclotomic gate sets. We propose a cutoff-based procedure which reduces the problem of verifying the equivalence of parameterized quantum circuits to the problem of verifying the equivalence of finitely many parameter-free quantum circuits. Because the number of parameter-free circuits grows exponentially with the number of parameters, we also propose a probabilistic variant of the algorithm for cases when the number of parameters is intractably large. We show that our techniques extend to equivalence modulo global phase, and describe an efficient angle sampling procedure for cyclotomic gate sets.</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization of Quantumness Using the Uncertainty Principle, Coherence, and Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality have been individually examined through many experiments. In this Letter, we systematically characterize all of this quantumness in a unified manner. We first construct universal uncertainty relations to reveal intrinsic features of incompatible measurements, which include all the state-independent uncertainties as special cases. We further extend to witness both quantum coherence and Bell nonlocality. We finally perform experiments with unified two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality within the experimental error. Our methods for witnessing quantumness are valuable in characterizing quantum correlations in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>One-way network nonlocality of continuous variable entangled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality is a key feature of quantum networks and is being studied for its potential applications in quantum communication and computing. Understanding and harnessing nonlocality in quantum networks could lead to the development of faster and more secure communication systems. All the nonclassicalities are limited to discrete variable quantum networks. We propose the first method to verify the network nonlocality of all optical quantum network consisting of two entangled states where one-way classical communication is allowed. This provides the first device-independent method to verify the quantum correlations generated from all optical continuous-variable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Many-body Dynamics with Projected Ensembles on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced, revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication for advancing quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supremacy through Fock State $q$ boson Sampling with Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmon qubits have traditionally been regarded as limited to random circuit sampling, incapable of performing Fock state boson sampling, a problem known to be classically intractable. This work challenges that assumption by introducing $q$ boson Fock state sampling, a variant in which transmon qubits can operate effectively. Through direct mapping to the $q$ boson formalism, we demonstrate that transmons possess the capability to achieve quantum supremacy in $q$ boson sampling tasks. This finding expands the potential applications of transmon-based quantum processors and paves the way for new avenues in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic quantum search on all Laplacian integral graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However, these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in previous works, in a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Bose-Marletto-Vedral experiment without observable spacetime superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems. In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adaptive Search: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Global Optimization of Multivariate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Aware Quantum Kernel Design Based on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods have emerged as a promising direction in quantum machine learning (QML), offering a principled way to map classical data into high-dimensional quantum Hilbert spaces. While conceptually powerful, designing effective quantum kernels that adapt to both the target task and the constraints of near-term quantum hardware remains a nontrivial challenge. In this work, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design framework that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and graph neural networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits. By predicting surrogate metrics related to fidelity and kernel performance, HaQGNN enables efficient circuit screening at scale. Feature selection is further incorporated to improve compatibility with limited-qubit systems and mitigate kernel degradation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Credit Card, MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms existing quantum kernel baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our work highlights the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for advancing practical quantum kernel design on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks: First Hitting Times with Weak Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter between the ancilla and the quantum system.</description>

      <title>Optical response of a binary atomic system with incoherent gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering, absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast, at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two noninteracting atoms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission linewidth.</description>

      <title>Strict hierarchy between $n$-wise measurement simulability, compatibility structures, and multi-copy compatibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results have for recent works using these different notions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by experiments on Rydberg atom arrays, we explore the properties of uniform quantum superpositions of kagome dimer configurations and construct an efficient algorithm for experimentally producing them. We begin by considering the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders, which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics in confined pseudo-harmonic oscillator in a time-dependent moving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solution of Schr\"odinger equation of confined pseudoharmonic potential in presence of a moving boundary condition, for an arbitrary angular momentum state. It turns out that an important quantity to probe the problem is internuclear distance ratio, which depends on the solution of Ermakov equation. The minimum value of time-dependent (TD) Heisenberg uncertainty product always remains greater than that of the minimum uncertainty product h/2. The TD average energy is derived analytically in a closed form and the corresponding average force and average pressure are defined. Moreover, time correlation function of two states for the case of six selected diatomic molecules (CO, NO, ScH, CH, H2, N2) is obtained. It is found to depend on internuclear distance ratio at two different time domains. The TD survival probability and average life-time of molecule in a confined quantum system are defined. Expressions are offered for quantum similarity measure, dissimilarity and quantum similarity index. The latter is given for a pair of molecules. The obtained results are compared with available literature, wherever possible. To our knowledge this is the first detailed report of a non-harmonic central potential in a TD moving boundary condition.</description>

Abstract: In a seminal article, Higuchi and Sudbery showed that a pure four-qubit state can not be maximally entangled across every bipartition. Such states are now known as absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. Here we give a series of old and new proofs of the fact that no four-qubit AME state exists. These are based on invariant theory, methods from coding theory, and basic properties from linear algebra such as the Pauli commutation relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry and criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle via measurement-free coherent feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Relative Error Quantum Compression and Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question of how much classical communication is needed when Alice is given a classical description of a quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for Bob to recover any expectation value $\langle \psi | M |\psi\rangle$ given an observable $M$ with $M$ Hermitian and $||M||_{\text{op}} \leq 1$. This task, whose study was initiated by Raz (ACM 1999) and more recently investigated by Gosset and Smolin (TQC 2019), can be thought of as a fully classical version of the pure state case of the well-known classical shadows problem in quantum learning theory. We show how the hardness of these two seemingly distinct problems are connected.
  We first consider the relative error version of the communication question and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ on the one-way randomized classical communication, improving upon an additive error lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ as shown by Gosset and Smolin. Notably, we show that this lower bound holds not only for the set of all observables but also when restricted to just the class of Pauli observables. This fact implies a $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ versus $O(\text{poly}(n))$ separation in the compression size between the relative and additive error settings for non-adaptive Pauli classical shadows with classical memory.
  Extending this framework, we prove randomized communication lower bounds for other relative error one-way classical communication tasks: an $\Omega(2^{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when instead Alice is given an observable and Bob is given a quantum state and they are asked to estimate the expectation value, an $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when restricted to Paulis, and an $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when Alice and Bob are both given quantum states and asked to estimate the inner product.</description>

      <title>A time-marching quantum algorithm for simulation of the nonlinear Lorenz dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this difficulty by developing a quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution of a second order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system, that similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated. Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system, reproducing both regular attractors--limit cycles--and the chaotic attractor within the chosen parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for a quantized memristive Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron, uniting principles from neuromorphic engineering and open quantum systems. Starting from a classical memristive LIF circuit, we apply canonical quantization techniques to derive a quantum model grounded in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Numerical simulations demonstrate key dynamical features of the quantized memristor and LIF neuron in the weak-coupling and adiabatic regime, including memory effects and spiking behaviour. This work establishes a foundational model for quantum neuromorphic computing, offering a pathway towards biologically inspired quantum spiking neural networks and new paradigms in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Interradical motion can push magnetosensing precision towards quantum limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent collisional master equation in a low-density gas with internal structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics with open systems is often based on the quantum optical weak-coupling master equation or on operational repeated interaction models, whereas early works on thermalisation and on decoherence theory were mostly concerned with the kinetics of gas collisions. Here we formulate a master equation for the dynamics of a quantum system under inelastic scattering with a dilute thermal gas in three dimensions, comprised of ancilla particles that also possess internal degrees of freedom. We show thermodynamic consistency when the gas is at thermal equilibrium, irrespective of whether or not the ancillas are in resonance with the system. In contrast, when the internal and the motional state of the gas are thermalised to different temperatures, the gas acts not as two distinct heat baths, but as a structured non-equilibrium reservoir that can generate useful energy through uncontrolled collisions.</description>

      <title>Counter-propagating spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in lithium niobate on insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate, and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity, and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Quantisation of Higher Time-Derivative Theories via Non-Unitary Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Assisted Ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost. Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$ of the total CI basis states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Protected by Acceleration From Nonadiabaticity and Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We put forth a hitherto unexplored control strategy that enables high-fidelity fast transport of an unstable quantum wavepacket even in the presence of bath-induced dissipation. The wavepacket, which is confined within any shallow (anharmonic) potential trap is steered in acceleration, so as to maximize the transfer fidelity. This strategy can generally optimize any non-Markovian bath-dressed continuous-variable system dynamics. It can simultaneously cope with wavepacket leakage via non-adiabatic transitions and bath-induced dissipation in an optimal fashion. It can outperform methods based on counterdiabatic fields (shortcuts to adiabaticity) particularly for fast non-adiabatic transport. Transport fidelity is maximized even for trajectories exceeding the speed of bath-excitation propagation, e.g. for supersonic transfer through phonon baths. This general approach is illustrated for optimized transfer of impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates. It is applicable to both dissipative and non-dissipative transfer of trapped atoms and ions and molecular reaction products.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Spin Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult, particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.</description>

Abstract: Research in quantum machine learning has recently proliferated due to the potential of quantum computing to accelerate machine learning. An area of machine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to improve the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary differential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog Rydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also introduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom quantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using analog quantum neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Stark-Coleman Invariants and Quantum Lower Bounds: An Integrated Framework for Real Quadratic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Class groups of real quadratic fields represent fundamental structures in algebraic number theory with significant computational implications. While Stark's conjecture establishes theoretical connections between special units and class group structures, explicit constructions have remained elusive, and precise quantum complexity bounds for class group computations are lacking. Here we establish an integrated framework defining Stark-Coleman invariants $\kappa_p(K) = \log_p \left( \frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p}}{\sigma(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{St},p})} \right) \mod p^{\mathrm{ord}_p(\Delta_K)}$ through a synthesis of $p$-adic Hodge theory and extended Coleman integration. We prove these invariants classify class groups under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), resolving the isomorphism problem for discriminants $D &gt; 10^{32}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach yields the quantum lower bound $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{\log D}{(\log \log D)^2}\right)\right)$ for the class group discrete logarithm problem, improving upon previous bounds lacking explicit constants. Our results indicate that Stark units constrain the geometric organization of class groups, providing theoretical insight into computational complexity barriers.</description>

      <title>Floquet operator dynamics and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator spreading under stroboscopic time evolution due to a unitary is studied. An operator Krylov space is constructed and related to orthogonal polynomials on a unit circle (OPUC), as well as to the Krylov space of the edge operator of the Floquet transverse field Ising model with inhomogeneous couplings (ITFIM). The Verblunsky coefficients in the OPUC representation are related to the Krylov angles parameterizing the ITFIM. The relations between the OPUC and spectral functions are summarized and several applications are presented. These include derivation of analytic expressions for the OPUC for persistent $m$-periodic dynamics, and the numerical construction of the OPUC for autocorrelations of the homogeneous Floquet-Ising model as well as the $Z_3$ clock model. The numerically obtained Krylov angles of the $Z_3$ clock model with long-lived period tripled autocorrelations show a spatial periodicity of six, and this observation is used to develop an analytically solvable model for the ITFIM that mimics this behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantized Chern-Simons Axion Coupling in Anomalous Floquet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Alchemical Free Energy Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical workflow aimed at improving the accuracy of alchemical free energy (AFE) predictions by incorporating configuration interaction (CI) simulations using the book-ending correction method. This approach applies the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) over a coupling parameter {\lambda} to smoothly transition the system from molecular mechanics (MM) ({\lambda} = 0) to a quantum mechanics (QM) ({\lambda} = 1) description. The resulting correction is then applied to the classically (MM) computed AFE to account for the more accurate QM treatment. The standard book-ending procedure uses AMBER to simulate the MM region, and QUICK, AMBER's default QM engine, to handle the QM region with either the Hartree-Fock (HF) method or density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we introduce a novel interface to QUICK, via sander, that enables CI simulations, and can operate in two ways: A) via PySCF backend to perform full configuration interaction (FCI) using conventional computing resources, B) quantum-centric sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) workflow via Qiskit which leverages both quantum hardware and post-processing on conventional computing resources for CI simulations. In this workflow QUICK performs most steps of the calculations, but at user-defined intervals, it redirects the computation to either FCI or SQD backend to get the CI result. We computed the book-end corrections for the hydration free energy (HFE) of three small organic molecules (ammonia, methane, and water) to benchmark the proposed approach and demonstrate how quantum-computers can be used in AFE calculations. We believe that this approach can be scaled to more complex systems like drug-receptor interactions in future studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training for Optical Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive optical information processors have demonstrated significant promise in delivering high-speed, parallel, and energy efficient inference for scaling machine learning tasks. Training, however, remains a major computational bottleneck, compounded by large datasets and many simulations required for state-of-the-art classification models. The underlying linear transformations in such systems are inherently constrained to compositions of circulant and diagonal matrix factors, representing free-space propagation and phase and/or amplitude modulation of light, respectively. While theoretically established that an arbitrary linear transformation can be generated by such factors, only upper bounds on the number of factors exist, which are experimentally unfeasible. Additionally, physical parameters such as inter-layer distance, number of layers, and phase-only modulation further restrict the solution space. Without tractable analytical decompositions, prior works have implemented various constrained minimization techniques. As trainable elements occupy a small subset of the overall transformation, existing techniques incur unnecessary computational overhead, limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate significant reduction in training time by exploiting the structured and sparse nature of diffractive systems in training and inference. We introduce a novel backpropagation algorithm that incorporates plane wave decomposition via the Fourier transform, computing gradients across all trainable elements in a given layer simultaneously, using only change-of-basis and element wise multiplication. Given the lack of a closed-form mathematical decomposition for realizable optical architectures, this approach is not only valuable for machine learning tasks but broadly applicable for the generation of arbitrary linear transformations, wavefront shaping, and other signal processing tasks.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is, however, still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and uncovering a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that classical heuristics can sharpen certain quantum parameters, underscoring the complementary strengths of classical and quantum computing. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.</description>

      <title>HybridQ: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for Skin Disease Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.</description>

      <title>Complexity of PXP scars revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a quantum quench scenario in which either a scarring or thermalizing initial state evolves under the PXP Hamiltonian. Within this framework, we study the time evolution of spread complexity and related quantities in the Krylov basis. We find that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, as functions of the iteration number $n$, exhibit a characteristic arched growth and decay, followed by erratic oscillations which we refer to as buttress. The arched profile predominantly arises from contributions within the quantum many-body scar subspace, while the buttress is linked to thermalization dynamics. To explain this behavior, we utilize the representation theory of $\mathfrak{s}l_3(\mathbb{C})$, allowing us to decompose the PXP Hamiltonian into a linear component and a residual part. The linear term governs the formation and width of the arch, and we observe that that there exists a threshold of arch width which determines whether a given initial state exhibits scarring. Meanwhile, the residual term accounts qualitatively for the emergence of the buttress. We estimate an upper bound for the extent of the buttress using Lucas numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that spread complexity oscillates periodically over time for scarred initial states, whereas such oscillations are suppressed in thermalizing cases.</description>

Abstract: As a contribution to the field of quantum mereology, we study how a change of tensor productstructure in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space affects its entanglement properties. In particular, we askwhether, given a time-evolving state, there exists a tensor product structure in which no entanglementis generated. We give a concrete, constructive example of disentangling tensor product structure in thecase of a C-NOT gate evolution between two qbits, before showing that this cannot be achieved for mosttime-evolving quantum states.</description>

      <title>Generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in monolithic photonic waveguides by leveraging intrinsic crystal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced photonic quantum technologies -- from quantum key distribution to quantum computing -- require on-chip sources of entangled photons that are both efficient and readily scalable. In this theoretical study, we demonstrate the generation of polarization-entangled Bell states in structurally simple waveguides by exploiting the intrinsic properties of nonlinear crystals. We thereby circumvent elaborate phase-matching strategies that commonly involve the spatial modulation of a waveguide's linear or nonlinear optical properties. We derive general criteria for the second-order susceptibility tensor that enable the generation of cross-polarized photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in single-material waveguides. Based on these criteria, we systematically categorize all birefringent, non-centrosymmetric crystal classes in terms of their suitability. Using coupled mode theory, we then numerically analyze cuboid waveguides made from two materials that are highly relevant to integrated photonics: lithium niobate, a well-established platform, and barium titanate, an emerging alternative. We find that barium titanate consistently outperforms lithium niobate by providing a higher nonlinear efficiency and high concurrence over a significantly broader spectral range. These findings outline a practical route toward highly efficient, fabrication-friendly, and scalable sources of polarization-entangled photons for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Observing Laughlin's pump using quantized edge states in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Time Formalism for Causal Nonlinear Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that causal linear response functions can be found by computing the much simpler imaginary time-ordered Matsubara functions and performing an analytic continuation. This principle is the basis for much of our understanding of linear response for interacting and disordered systems, via diagrammatic perturbation theory. Similar imaginary-time approaches have recently been introduced for computing nonlinear response functions as well, although the rigorous connection between Matsubara and causal nonlinear response functions has not been clearly elucidated. In this work, we provide a proof of this connection to all orders in perturbation theory. Using an equations of motion approach, we show by induction that casual nonlinear response functions at every order can be obtained from an analytic continuation of an appropriate time-ordered Matsubara function. We demonstrate this connection explicitly for second order response functions in the Lehmann representation. As a byproduct of our approach, we derive an explicit expression for the Lehmann representation of $n$-th order response functions by solving the equations of motion. We also use our result to find an analytic spectral density representation for both causal response functions and Matsubara functions. Finally, we show how our results lead to a family of generalized sum rules, focusing explicitly on the asymptotic expression for $n$-th harmonic generation rate.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm using polar decomposition to approximate a channel characterized by a single unitary matrix based on input-output quantum state pairs. In limited data, we state and prove that the optimal solution obtained from our method using one pair with a specific structure will generate an equivalent class, significantly reducing the dimension of the searching space. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary matrices describing the same channel differ by a complex number with modulus 1. We rigorously prove our proposed algorithm can ultimately identify a critical point, which is also a local minimum of the established objective function.</description>

      <title>Observers and Timekeepers: From the Page-Wootters Mechanism to the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity in a closed universe faces two a priori distinct yet seemingly related issues: the problem of time and the fact that its Hilbert space dimension is one. Both have been argued to be resolvable by formulating physics relative to an observer. Using a simple gravitational path integral model, we explain that the two issues arise from two distinct non-perturbative effects: the former from summing over metrics and the latter from summing over topologies. We then revisit the Page-Wootters mechanism, one of the earliest frameworks for formulating quantum mechanics relative to an observer, see how it applies to both issues, and introduce some new ingredients. In particular, we emphasize a hierarchy between an observer and a timekeeper. An observer is a subsystem of the universe whose specification results in a nontrivial Hilbert space, while a timekeeper is an observer with a specified history that can be used as a reference for the time of the environment and experiences a nontrivial time evolution. Finally, we propose a method for incorporating observers and timekeepers into the gravitational path integral and show that implementing a timekeeper in this way furnishes an observer-dependent generalization of holography.</description>

      <title>Correlated reaction coordinate motion produces non-additive rate enhancement for electron and energy transfer in multi-acceptor structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular structures with multiple donor, bridge, or acceptor units can display quantum interference effects that influence electron and energy transfer (ET and EnT) rates. Recent experiments found a 4- to 5-fold increase in ET rates for donor-acceptor structures with two acceptors compared to one. This result is surprising: simple classical or quantum analysis suggests a factor of two rate enhancement. We analyze the coupling interactions in multiple acceptor systems and find that rate enhancements beyond additive effects arise from acceptor-acceptor interactions that: 1) shift the reaction free energy, 2) change the donor-acceptor couplings, and 3) alter the reaction-coordinate motion. Consideration of these effects explains the observed rates in multi-acceptor systems and suggests strategies to tailor energy and electron transfer kinetics.</description>

Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Rashba spin-orbit coupling and artificially engineered topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Possible consequences for physics of the negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem</title>

Abstract: In 2020, Ji et al. [arXiv:2001.04383 and Comm.~ACM 64}, 131 (2021)] provided a proof that the complexity classes $\text{MIP}^\ast$ and $\text{RE}$ are equivalent. This result implies a negative resolution of Tsirelson's problem, that is, $C_{qa}$ (the closure of the set of tensor product correlations) and $C_{qc}$ (the set of commuting correlations) can be separated by a hyperplane (that is, a Bell-like inequality). In particular, there are correlations produced by commuting measurements (a finite number of them and with a finite number of outcomes) on an infinite-dimensional quantum system which cannot be approximated by sequences of finite-dimensional tensor product correlations. Here, we point out that there are four logical possibilities of this result. Each possibility is interesting because it fundamentally challenges the nature of spacially separated systems in different ways. We list open problems for making progress for deciding which of the possibilities is correct.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising for solving practical problems such as combinatorial optimization, quantum chemistry simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum error correction on noisy quantum computers. However, with typical random ansatz or quantum alternating operator ansatz, derived variational quantum algorithms become a black box that cannot be trusted for model interpretation, not to mention deploying as applications in informing critical decisions: the results of these variational parameters are just rotational angles for the quantum gates and have nothing to do with interpretable values that a model can provide directly. In this paper, we construct the first interpretable quantum regression algorithm, in which the quantum state exactly encodes the classical data table and the variational parameters correspond directly to the regression coefficients, which are real numbers by construction, providing a high degree of model interpretability and minimal cost to optimize due to the right expressiveness. We also take advantage of the encoded data structure to reduce the time complexity of computing the regression map. To shorten the circuit depth for nonlinear regression, our algorithm can be extended by building nonlinear features by classical preprocessing as the independent encoded column vectors. Even though the realization of compressed encoding in superconducting qubits has been achieved by the less noisy compressed encoding recently by the authors, we envision potential quantum utilities with multi-qubit gates implemented in neutral cold atoms and ions.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in Ising spin systems with periodic transverse magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scrambling of quantum information in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet spin systems is studied. Our study employs tripartite mutual information (TMI), with negative TMI serving as an indicator of scrambling, where a more negative value suggests a higher degree of scrambling. Both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems display scrambling behavior across all periods lying between 0 to {\pi}/2, except at self-dual point({\pi}/4). Nonintegrable Floquet systems exhibit more pronounced scrambling compared to integrable ones across all periods. The degree of scrambling increases as we move towards the self-dual point (but not at the self-dual point), regardless of the initial states. TMI demonstrates periodic behavior at the self-dual point, with a period matching the system size in the case of the integrable system while displaying complex patterns in the non-integrable system. The initial growth of scrambling in both integrable and nonintegrable Floquet systems manifests as a power-law increase for small periods, followed by a sudden jump in scrambling near the self-dual point.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the tomography of the spatial structure of light. We develop a simple technique that allows one to perform the tomography over the space of fixed order modes. The technique is based on two spatially resolved intensity measurements, the second of which is performed after the light field has undergone an astigmatic transformation implemented by a tilted lens. We demonstrate that this method is informationally complete within the considered subspaces, which is experimentally verified both in the intense and the photocount regime. We also study the effect of obstructions in our ability to reconstruct the states. The work here presented is expected to help the development of characterization techniques in the field of structured light and in its application for both classical and quantum information protocols.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore using the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm to address scientific and engineering problems through quantum computing utilizing the NWQSim simulation package on high-performance computing. Focusing on domains such as power-grid management and heat transfer problems, we demonstrate the correlations of the precision of quantum phase estimation, along with various properties of coefficient matrices, on the final solution and quantum resource cost in iterative and non-iterative numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson method and finite difference method, as well as their impacts on quantum error correction costs using Microsoft Azure Quantum resource estimator. We conclude the exponential resource cost from quantum phase estimation before and after quantum error correction and illustrate a potential way to reduce the demands on physical qubits. This work lays down a preliminary step for future investigations, urging a closer examination of quantum algorithms' scalability and efficiency in domain applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage tomography based on eigenanalysis for high-dimensional dense unitary processes in gate-based quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying, i.e. estimating, a quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we develop QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, in the sense that they use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated with simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods efficiently apply up to 13 qubits on a standard PC (with 16 GB of RAM). Multi-stage methods yield an even higher accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and St\"uckelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to a substantial reduction of $P$, being possible even to achieve $P=0$ in an instructive extreme case, and also to large $P$ even in the absence of any anticrossing point. The partial LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to develop a general framework for thermodynamics, suitable for the regime of strong coupling and correlations between subsystems of an autonomous quantum "universe," has entailed diverging definitions for basic quantities, including internal energy. While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest, we propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for the environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of the universe. We introduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based approaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this context, in both a weak and a strong forms, discussing the underlying subtleties. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe model, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating their effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently devised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal energies are neither additive nor conservative, which leads to unphysical features.</description>

Abstract: Standard compilers for quantum circuits decompose arbitrary single-qubit gates into a sequence of physical X(pi/2) pulses and virtual-Z phase gates. Consequently, many circuit classes implement different logic operations but have an equivalent structure of physical pulses that only differ by changes in virtual phases. When many structurally-equivalent circuits need to be measured, generating sequences for each circuit is unnecessary and cumbersome, since compiling and loading sequences onto classical control hardware is a primary bottleneck in quantum circuit execution. In this work, we develop a hardware-assisted protocol for executing parameterized circuits on our FPGA-based control hardware, QubiC. This protocol relies on a hardware-software co-design technique in which software identifies structural equivalency in circuits and "peels" off the relevant parameterized angles to reduce the overall waveform compilation time. The hardware architecture then performs real-time "stitching" of the parameters in the circuit to measure circuits that implement a different overall logical operation. This work demonstrates significant speed ups in the total execution time for several different classes of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Structure Factor from Weak Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum simulation is a leading application for achieving quantum advantage. However, high circuit depths remain a limiting factor on near-term quantum hardware. We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.</description>

      <title>Amplifying hybrid entangled states and superpositions of coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two amplification schemes, photon addition and then subtraction ($\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$) and successive photon addition ($\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$), applied to hybrid entangled states (HESs) and superpositions of coherent states (SCSs). We show that the amplification schemes' fidelity and gain for HESs are the same as those of coherent states. On the other hand, SCSs show quite nontrivial behaviors by the amplification schemes, depending on the amplitudes of coherent states, number of coherent-state components, and relative phases between the components. This implies that appropriate amplification schemes for SCSs should be chosen depending on the tasks and specific forms of the states. To investigate the quality of amplified states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information, a measure of quantum phase estimation. In terms of the quantum Fisher information, the $\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$ scheme tends to show better performance for relatively small amplitudes while the $\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$ scheme is better in larger amplitude regime. The performance of the two schemes becomes indistinguishable as the amplitude grows sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Quantum Token Obfuscation via Superposition: A Post-Quantum Security Framework Using Multi-Basis Verification and Entropy-Driven Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional cryptographic techniques, including token obfuscation, are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks due to advancements in quantum computing. Quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's pose significant threats to classical security methods, necessitating quantum-resistant alternatives. This study proposes a quantum-based approach to token obfuscation that leverages superposition and multi-basis verification to enhance security against quantum adversaries. Tokens are encoded in quantum superposition states, ensuring probabilistic concealment until measured. A multi-basis verification protocol strengthens authentication by requiring validation across multiple quantum measurement bases. Additionally, a quantum decay protocol and token refresh mechanism dynamically manage the token lifecycle to prevent prolonged exposure and replay attacks. The model was tested through quantum simulations, evaluating entropy quality, adversarial robustness, and token verification reliability. Experimental validation demonstrates an entropy quality score of 0.9996, a 0% attack success rate across five adversarial models, and a 67% false positive rate, indicating strict security constraints. These findings confirm the effectiveness of quantum-based token obfuscation in preventing unauthorized reconstruction. The proposed approach provides a foundation for post-quantum cryptographic security by integrating entropy-driven state transformations, dynamic token evolution, and multi-basis verification. Future work will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and testing real-world implementations on quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: In this work, a scalable quantum neural network is introduced as a means to approximate any unitary evolution through the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB) and, subsequently, redesigned with a number of CNOTs asymptotically reduced by an exponential contribution. This algebraic approach to the problem of unitary synthesis exploits Lie algebras and their topological features to obtain scalable parameterizations of unitary operators. First, the original SRBB-based scalability scheme, already known in the literature only from a theoretical point of view, is reformulated for efficient algorithm implementation and complexity management. Remarkably, 2-qubit operators emerge as a special case outside the original scaling scheme. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed to reduce the number of CNOTs, thus deriving a new implementable scaling scheme that requires only one layer of approximation. The scalable CNOT-reduced quantum neural network is implemented and its performance is assessed with a variety of different unitary matrices, both sparse and dense, up to 6 qubits via the PennyLane library. The effectiveness of the approximation is measured with different metrics in relation to two optimizers: a gradient-based method and the Nelder-Mead method. The approximate CNOT-reduced SRBB-based synthesis algorithm is also tested on real hardware and compared with other valid approximation and decomposition methods available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Few-fermion resonant tunneling and underbarrier trapping in asymmetric potentials</title>

Abstract: Understanding quantum tunneling in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and nanoscale device design. Despite extensive studies of quantum tunneling, the role of interactions in determining directional transport through asymmetric barriers in discrete quantum systems remains unclear. Here we show that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of barrier orientation, while inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and create pronounced asymmetric tunneling behavior. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations of two spin-1/2 fermions: spin-triplet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-singlet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling -- a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and being fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.</description>

      <title>Amplifying microwave pulses with a single qubit engine fueled by quantum measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Device-Independent Schmidt Number Certification of All Entangled States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite quantum states with higher Schmidt numbers have been shown to outperform those with lower Schmidt numbers in various quantum information processing tasks, highlighting the operational advantage of entanglement dimensionality. Certifying the Schmidt number of such states is therefore crucial for efficient resource utilization. Ideally, this certification should rely as little as possible on the certifying devices to ensure robustness against their potential imperfections. Fully device-independent certification via Bell-nonlocal games offer strong robustness but suffers from fundamental limitations: it cannot certify the Schmidt number of all entangled states. We demonstrate that this insufficiency of Bell-nonlocal games is not limited to entangled states that do not exhibit Bell-nonlocality. Specifically, we prove the existence of Bell-nonlocal states whose Schmidt number cannot be certified by any Bell-nonlocal game when the parties are restricted to local projective measurements. To overcome this, we develop a measurement-device-independent certification method based on semi-quantum nonlocal games, which assume trusted preparation devices but treat measurement devices as black boxes. We prove that for any bipartite state with Schmidt number exceeding r, there exists a semi-quantum nonlocal game that can certify its Schmidt number. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of such a semi-quantum nonlocal game based on an optimal Schmidt number witness operator.</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a large class of 2-adic Schr\"odinger equations is the scaling limit of certain continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs). Practically, a discretization of such an equation gives a CTQMC. As a practical result, we construct new types of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on graphs using two symmetric matrices. One matrix describes the transport between nodes in one direction, while the second describes the transport between nodes in the opposite direction. This construction includes, as a particular case, the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) and the role of the hypothesis of the discreteness of space. The connection between 2-adic QM and CTQWs shows that 2-adic QM has a physical meaning. 2-Adic QM is a nonlocal theory because the Hamiltonians used are nonlocal operators, and consequently, spooky actions at a distance are allowed. However, this theory is not a mathematical toy. The experimental confirmation of the violation of Bell's inequality implies that this theory allows realism. We pointed out several new research problems connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Percolation thresholds and connectivity in quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study entanglement percolation in qubit-based planar quantum network models of arbitrary topology, where neighboring nodes are initially connected by pure states with quenched disorder in their entanglement. To address this, we develop a physics-informed heuristic algorithm designed to find a sequence of entanglement swapping and distillation operations to connect any pair of distant nodes. The algorithm combines locally optimal percolation strategies between nodes at a maximum distance of one swapping operation. If this fails to produce a maximally entangled state, it looks for alternative paths surrounding intermediate states within the process. We analytically find and numerically verify thresholds in quantum percolation, which depend on the initial network configuration and entanglement, and are associated with specific percolation strategies. We classify these strategies based on the connectivity, a quantity that relates the entanglement in the final state and the level of integrity of the network at the end of the process. We find distinct regimes of quantum percolation, which are clearly separated by the percolation thresholds of the employed strategies and vastly vary according to the network topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as an alternative perspective on quantum measurement. BHSI describes measurement as a unitary branching of the local Hilbert space into decoherent, independent, and unitarily evolving subspaces, while updating observer states (through their equipment) by causally engaging and disengaging operators. Unlike the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), BHSI avoids wave function collapse while maintaining the Born rule through the branch weights associated with the initial system state. Unlike the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), BHSI sidesteps parallel worlds by entangling branches with the local environment within a single world. We compare BHSI features with those of CI, MWI, and Bohmian Mechanics (BM). We investigate its implications for the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, and the delayed-choice quantum eraser. We examine quantum teleportation, demonstrating that locally controlled decoherence and recoherence processes (CDRP) can be observed. Specifically, we suggest experiments using modern Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGI) to visualize the CDRP, measure branch weights that encode the Born rule, and predict the electromagnetic (EM) phase shift resulting from the independent unitary evolution of decoherent branches. BHSI thus provides a minimalist alternative to interpretations based on collapse or many-worlds.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Decomposition of the Carleman Linearized Burgers' Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein, we present a polylogarithmic decomposition method to load the matrix from the linearized 1-dimensional Burgers' equation onto a quantum computer. First, we use the Carleman linearization method to map the nonlinear Burgers' equation into an infinite linear system of equations, which is subsequently truncated to order $\alpha$. This new finite linear system is then embedded into a larger system of equations with the key property that its matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log n_t + \alpha^2\log n_x)$ terms for $n_t$ time steps and $n_x$ spatial grid points. While the terms in this linear combination are not unitary, each is implemented with a simple block encoding and the variational quantuam linear solver (VQLS) routine may be used to obtain a solution. Finally, a complexity analysis of the required VQLS circuits shows that the upper bound of the two-qubit gate depth among all of the block encoded matrices is $\mathcal{O}(\alpha(\log n_x)^2)$. This is therefore the first efficient data loading method of a Carleman linearized system.</description>

      <title>Large speed-up of quantum emitter detection via quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key resource in quantum technologies, microscopy, and other applications. The ability to rapidly detect them is useful both for quality control in engineered emitter arrays and for high-contrast imaging of naturally occurring emitters. Using full photon-counting statistics and optimal Bayesian hypothesis testing, we show that extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between quantum emission and a coherent field enables orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in emitter detection under realistic noise and loss. Strikingly, the performance advantage improves as loss and background noise increase, and persists for incoherent emission. Taken together with prior demonstrations of extended Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, this suggest that substantial performance gains are achievable with current technology under realistic, non-ideal conditions. This offers a new approach to fast, low-intensity imaging and for emitter characterization in large-scale quantum systems. Fundamentally, the discovery that quantum interference and measurements, used together, are more robust to both loss and noise than standard measurement techniques opens the possibility of broad applications across quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: We characterize exact, and approximate, optimality of games that players can interact with using quantum strategies. In comparison to a previous work of the author, arXiv: 2311.12887, which applied a 2016 framework due to Ostrev for constructing error bounds beyond CHSH and XOR games, in addition to the existence of well-posed semidefinite programs for determining primal feasible solutions, along with quantum-classical duality gaps, it continues to remain of interest to further develop the construction of error bounds, and related objects, to game-theoretic settings with several participants. In such settings, one encounters a rich information theoretic landscape, not only from the fact that there exists a significantly larger combinatorial space of possible strategies for each player, but also several opportunities for pronounced quantum advantage. We conclude this effort by describing other variants of other possible strategies, as proposed sources for quantum advantage, in $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, compiled $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$, and strong parallel repetition variants of $\mathrm{XOR}^{*}$ games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a bosonic anomaly emerging in the quantum harmonic oscillator, whose partition function is rigorously identified as the Chern character via the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, establishing a new connection among statistical mechanics, anomaly, Atiyah-Singer index theorem and Gromov-Witten theory. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physical sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime by using Grothentic-Riemann-Roch theorem. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete non-SUSY manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly. Furthermore, we arrive at Gromov-Witten theory through a more direct and physically intuitive approach. As a result, the internal energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator serves as a bridge linking two key concepts in physics -- statistical mechanics and anomalies -- with three fundamental mathematical frameworks: the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, and Gromov-Witten theory.</description>

Abstract: We have constructed and run a Bell test of local realism focusing on the objectivity criterion. The objectivity means that the outcomes are confirmed macroscopically by a few observers at each party. The IBM Quantum and IonQ devices turn out to be sufficiently accurate to pass such an extended Bell-type test, although at the price of communication loopholes and residual but statistically significant signaling. The test also serves as the benchmark of entanglement spread across larger sets of qubits.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the use of quantum probes to accurately determine the strength of the local gravitational field on Earth. Our findings show that delocalized probes generally outperform localized ones, with the precision enhancement scaling quadratically with the separation between the two wavefunction components. This advantage persists under realistic position measurements, which can achieve precision not too far from the ultimate bound. We also discuss the influence of Earth's surface, demonstrating that its effect can be neglected until shortly before the particle hits the floor. Finally, we address the joint estimation of the gravitational acceleration $g$ and the probe mass $m$, proving that the excess estimation noise arising from their inherent incompatibility is negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first search for ultralight dark matter using a magnetically levitated particle. A sub-millimeter permanent magnet is levitated in a superconducting trap with a measured force sensitivity of $0.2\,\mathrm{fN/\sqrt{Hz}}$. We find no evidence of a signal and derive limits on dark matter coupled to the difference between baryon and lepton number, $B - L$, in the mass range $(1.10360 \text{ - } 1.10485) \times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{eV} / c^2$. Our most stringent limit on the coupling strength is $g_{B - L} \lesssim 2.98 \times 10^{-21}$. We propose the POLONAISE (Probing Oscillations using Levitated Objects for Novel Accelerometry in Searches of Exotic physics) experiment, featuring short-, medium-, and long-term upgrades that will give us leading sensitivity in a wide mass range and demonstrating the promise of this novel quantum sensing technology in the hunt for dark matter.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Parallel Token Swapping for Qubit Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a combinatorial reconfiguration problem that involves finding an optimal sequence of swaps to move an initial configuration of tokens that are placed on the vertices of a graph to a final desired one. This problem arises as a crucial step in reducing the depth of a quantum circuit when compiling a quantum algorithm. We provide the first known constant factor approximation algorithms for the parallel token swapping problem on graph topologies that are commonly found in modern quantum computers, including cycle graphs, subdivided star graphs, and grid graphs. We also study the so-called stretch factor of a natural lower bound to the problem, which has been shown to be useful when designing heuristics for the qubit routing problem. Finally, we study the colored version of this reconfiguration problem where some tokens share the same color and are considered indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization and the non-Hermitian skin effect are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are driven, respectively, by disorder and nonreciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate a delocalization-localization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between Anderson localization and the skin effect can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate that quantum jumps between the skin states and the Anderson-localized states occur in the theoretical model. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The voltage profile of the circuit exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the skin effect, while the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the circuit can be perceived via a predicted localization behavior near the excitation node, rather than exhibiting sudden non-Hermitian jumps, as observed in the tight-binding framework. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the output voltage of the circuit. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits, opening avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic systems such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient devices for information transfer and communication.</description>

      <title>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J &lt; 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyperhoneycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyperhoneycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyperhoneycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational-wave detectors have achieved remarkable sensitivity around 100 Hz, enabling ground-breaking discoveries. Enhancing sensitivity at higher frequencies in the kilohertz (kHz) range promises access to rich physics, particularly the extreme conditions during the merger stage of binary neutron stars. However, the high-frequency sensitivity of Michelson-based interferometers is fundamentally limited by their linear optical cavities, which are optimized for low-frequency signal enhancement. In [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)], a new configuration employing an L-shaped optical resonator was proposed to overcome this limitation, offering exceptional sensitivity in the kHz band. As a pathfinder, the 12-meter prototype at Beijing Normal University is designed to demonstrate the sensing and control schemes of this new kHz detector configuration and to explore its performance in the high-power regime with suspended optics. Beyond its primary scientific goal, the prototype also offers potential sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, potentially enabling constraints on exotic sources. This paper presents an overview of the prototype, including its optical design and current development status of key components.</description>

      <title>Boundary effects in classical liquid density fluctuations at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal effects on density fluctuations in confined classical liquids using phonon quantization. The system is modeled via a massless scalar field between perfectly reflecting parallel planes with Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the mean square mass density, total energy density, and thermodynamic quantities including Helmholtz free energy and entropy densities. Our analysis identifies distinct regimes, namely, a low-temperature quantum regime exhibiting characteristic power-law behavior for each boundary condition, and a high-temperature classical regime where $\hbar$-independent behavior emerges as expected. A particularly interesting finding shows that while most quantities transition naturally to classical behavior, the mean square density fluctuation requires explicit consideration of the $\hbar\to 0$ limit. The entropy density vanishes at zero temperature, in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem. Numerical analysis confirms our analytical results, particularly the asymptotic temperature behaviors and the intermediate crossover region, in which quantum and classical effects compete. This regime is governed by the energy scale $k_B T \sim \hbar u / a$, where $a$ is the distance between the planes and $u$ is the sound velocity.</description>

Abstract: We establish the equivalence between exponential decay of the relative entropy along a quantum Markov semigroup and the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for general von Neumann algebras. We also extend an intertwining criterion for the modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality to GNS-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on infinite-dimensional von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond laser-written nano-ablations containing bright antibunched emitters on gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond laser-writing offers distinct capabilities for fabrication, including three-dimensional, multi-material, and sub-diffraction-limited patterning. In particular, demonstrations of laser-written quantum emitters and photonic devices with superior optical properties have attracted attention. Recently, gallium nitride (GaN) has been reported to host quantum emitters with narrow and bright zero-phonon photoluminescence from ultraviolet to telecom ranges. However, emitters formed during epitaxy are randomly positioned, and until now, it has not been possible to fabricate quantum emitters in ordered arrays. In this paper, we employ femtosecond laser writing to create nano-ablations with sub-diffraction-limited diameter, and use rapid thermal annealing to activate co-located stable emitters. The emitters show MHz antibunched emission with a sharp spectral peak at room temperature. Our study not only presents an efficient approach to laser-written nanofabrication on GaN but also offers a promising pathway for the deterministic creation of quantum emitters in GaN, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms involved.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.</description>
