      <title>Irreducibility of toric complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an approach to study the irreducibility of generic complete intersections in the algebraic torus defined by equations with fixed monomials and fixed linear relations on coefficients. Using our approach we generalize the irreducibility theorems of Khovanskii to fields of arbitrary characteristic. Also we get a combinatorial sufficient conditions for irreducibility of engineered complete intersections. As an application we give a combinatorial condition of irreducibility for some critical loci and Thom-Bordmann strata: $f = f'_x = 0$, $f'_x = f'_y = 0$, $f = f'_x = f'_{xx} = 0$, etc.</description>

      <title>A reduction theorem for good basic invariants of finite complex reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our previous article arXiv:2307.07897. We describe a certain reduction process of Satake's good basic invariants. We show that if the largest degree $d_1$ of a finite complex reflection group $G$ is regular and if $\delta$ is a divisor of $d_1$, a set of good basic invariants of $G$ induces that of the reflection subquotient $G_{\delta}$. We also show that the potential vector field of a duality group $G$, which gives the multiplication constants of the natural Saito structure on the orbit space, induces that of $G_{\delta}$. Several examples of this reduction process are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the monodromies at infinity of Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the recent progress in the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, we study the monodromies at infinity of the holomorphic solutions of Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules in some situations. Formulas for their eigenvalues are obtained by applying the theory of monodromy zeta functions to our previous results on the enhanced solution complexes of the Fourier transforms. In particular, in dimension one we thus find a reciprocity law between the monodromies at infinity of holonomic D-modules and their Fourier transforms.</description>

      <title>Abstract divisorial spaces and arithmetic intersection numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yuan and Zhang introduced arithmetic intersection numbers for adelic line bundles on quasi-projective varieties over a number field. Burgos and Kramer generalized this approach allowing more singular metrics at archimedean places. We introduce abstract divisorial spaces as a tool to generalize these arithmetic intersection numbers to the setting of a proper adelic base curve in the sense of Chen and Moriwaki. We also allow more singular metrics at non-archimedean places using relative mixed energy there as well.</description>

      <title>A superpotential for Grassmannian Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While mirror symmetry for flag varieties and Grassmannians has been extensively studied, Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian are singular, and hence standard mirror symmetry statements are not well-defined. Nevertheless, in this article we introduce a ``superpotential'' $W^{\lambda}$ for each Grassmannian Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$, generalizing the Marsh-Rietsch superpotential for Grassmannians, and we show that $W^{\lambda}$ governs many toric degenerations of $X_{\lambda}$. We also generalize the ``polytopal mirror theorem'' for Grassmannians from our previous work: namely, for any cluster seed $G$ for $X_{\lambda}$, we construct a corresponding Newton-Okounkov convex body $\Delta_G^{\lambda}$, and show that it coincides with the superpotential polytope $\Gamma_G^{\lambda}$, that is, it is cut out by the inequalities obtained by tropicalizing an associated Laurent expansion of $W^{\lambda}$. This gives us a toric degeneration of the Schubert variety $X_{\lambda}$ to the (singular) toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ of the Newton-Okounkov body. Finally, for a particular cluster seed $G=G^\lambda_{\mathrm{rec}}$ we show that the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{N}_{\lambda})$ has a small toric desingularisation, and we describe an intermediate partial desingularisation $Y(\mathcal{F}_\lambda)$ that is Gorenstein Fano. Many of our results extend to more general varieties in the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>Rational Curves on Coindex 3 Fano Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the moduli space of rational curves on smooth Fano varieties of coindex 3. For varieties of dimension 5 or greater, we prove the moduli space has a single irreducible component for each effective numerical class of curves. For varieties of dimension 4, we describe families of rational curves in terms of Fujita's $a$-invariant. Our results verify Lehmann and Tanimoto's Geometric Manin's Conjecture for all smooth coindex 3 Fano varieties over the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg models, Monge-Ampere domains and (pre-)Frobenius manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kontsevich suggested that the Landau-Ginzburg model presents a good formalism for homological mirror symmetry. In this paper we propose to investigate the LG theory from the viewpoint of Koopman-von Neumann's construction. New advances are thus provided, namely regarding a conjecture of Kontsevich--Soibelman (on a version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror problem). We show that there exists a Monge--Ampere domain Y, generated by a space of probability densities parametrising mirror dual Calabi-Yau manifolds. This provides torus fibrations over Y. The mirror pairs are obtained via the Berglund-Hubsch-Krawitz construction. We also show that the Monge-Ampere manifolds are pre-Frobenius manifolds. Our method allows to recover certain results concerning Lagrangian torus fibrations. We illustrate our construction on a concrete toy model, which allows us, additionally to deduce a relation between von Neumann algebras,, Monge--Ampere manifolds and pre-Frobenius manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We provide a fine classification of rigid three-dimensional torus quotients with isolated canonical singularities, up to biholomorphism and diffeomorphism. This complements the classification of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of type $\rm{III}_0$, which are those quotients with Gorenstein singularities.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a study of topological properties of the real Mordell-Weil group $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ of real rational elliptic surfaces $X$ which we accompany by a related study of real lines on $X$ and on the "subordinate" del Pezzo surfaces $Y$ of degree 1. We give an explicit description of isotopy types of real lines on $Y_{\mathbb R}$ and an explicit presentation of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in the mapping class group $\operatorname{Mod}(X_{\mathbb R})$. Combining these results we establish an explicit formula for the action of $\operatorname{MW}_{\mathbb R}$ in $H_1(X_{\mathbb R})$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the theory of complements, introduced by Shokurov, for Calabi-Yau type varieties with the coefficient set $[0,1]$. We show that there exists a finite set of positive integers $\mathcal{N}$, such that if a threefold pair $(X/Z\ni z,B)$ has an $\mathbb{R}$-complement which is klt over a neighborhood of $z$, then it has an $n$-complement for some $n\in\mathcal{N}$. We also show the boundedness of complements for $\mathbb{R}$-complementary surface pairs.</description>

      <title>Rational weighted projective hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very general hypersurface of dimension $n$ and degree $d$ in complex projective space is rational if $d \leq 2$, but is expected to be irrational for all $n, d \geq 3$. Hypersurfaces in weighted projective space with degree small relative to the weights are likewise rational. In this paper, we introduce rationality constructions for weighted hypersurfaces of higher degree that provide many new rational examples over any field. We answer in the affirmative a question of T. Okada about the existence of very general terminal Fano rational weighted hypersurfaces in all dimensions $n \geq 6$.</description>

      <title>A Real Generalized Trisecant Trichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical trisecant lemma says that a general chord of a non-degenerate space curve is not a trisecant; that is, the chord only meets the curve in two points. The generalized trisecant lemma extends the result to higher-dimensional varieties. It states that the linear space spanned by general points on a projective variety intersects the variety in exactly these points, provided the dimension of the linear space is smaller than the codimension of the variety and that the variety is irreducible, reduced, and non-degenerate. We prove a real analogue of the generalized trisecant lemma, which takes the form of a trichotomy. Along the way, we characterize the possible numbers of real intersection points between a real projective variety and a complimentary dimension real linear space. We show that any integer of correct parity between a minimum and a maximum number can be achieved. We then specialize to Segre-Veronese varieties, where our results apply to the identifiability of independent component analysis, tensor decomposition and to typical tensor ranks.</description>

      <title>Tilting Generator for the $T^*Gr(2,4)$ Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remarkable work of Kaledin, based on earlier joint work with Bezrukavnikov, has constructed a tilting generator of the category of coherent sheaves on a very general class of symplectic resolutions of singularities.
  In this paper, we give a concrete construction of this tilting generator on the cotangent bundle of $Gr(2,4)$, the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\mathbb{C}^4$. This construction builds on work of the second author describing these tilting bundles in terms of KLRW algebras, but in this low-dimensional case, we are able to describe our tilting generator as a sum of geometrically natural bundles on $T^*Gr(2,4)$: line bundles and their extensions, as well as the tautological bundle and its perpendicular.</description>

      <title>Improved fewnomial upper bounds from Wronskians and dessins d'enfant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant to show that if $P$ and $Q$ are two real polynomials, any real function of the form $x^\alpha(1-x)^{\beta} P - Q$, has at most $\deg P +\deg Q + 2$ roots in the interval $]0,~1[$. As a consequence, we obtain an upper bound on the number of positive solutions to a real polynomial system $f=g=0$ in two variables where $f$ has three monomials terms, and $g$ has $t$ terms. The approach we adopt for tackling this Fewnomial bound relies on the theory of Wronskians, which was used in Koiran et.\ al.\ (J.\ Symb.\ Comput., 2015) for producing the first upper bound which is polynomial in $t$.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of spaces of filtrations on local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of spaces of fitrations on a Noetherian local domain. We introduce a metric $d_1$ on the space of saturated filtrations, inspired by the Darvas metric in complex geometry, such that it is a geodesic metric space. In the toric case, using Newton-Okounkov bodies, we identify the space of saturated monomial filtrations with a subspace of $L^1_\mathrm{loc}$. We also consider several other topologies on such spaces and study the semi-continuity of the log canonical threshold function in the spirit of Koll\'ar-Demailly. Moreover, there is a natural lattice structure on the space of saturated filtrations, which is a generalization of the classical result that the ideals of a ring form a lattice.</description>

      <title>On the prismatization of $O_K$ beyond the Hodge-Tate locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X=\mathrm{Spf}(\mathcal{O}_K)$. We classify perfect complexes of $n$-truncated prismatic crystals on the prismatic site of $X$ when $n\leq 1+\frac{p-1}{e}$ by studying perfect complexes on the $n$-truncated prismatization of $X$, which are certain nilpotent thickenings of the Hodge-Tate stack of $X$ inside the prismatization of $X$. We describe the category of continuous semilinear representations and their cohomology for $G_K$ with coefficients in $B_{\mathrm{dR},n}^+$ via rationalization of vector bundles on the slight shrinking of the $n$-truncated prismatization of $X$. Along the way, we classify certain integral models for de Rham prismatic crystals studied in arXiv:2205.14914.</description>

      <title>Modular anomaly of BPS back holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Khovanskii bases and MUVAK bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Kaveh and Manon introduced Khovanskii bases as a special 'Gr\"obner-like' generating system of an algebra. We extend their work by considering an arbitrary grading on the algebra and propose a definition for a 'homogeneous Khovanskii basis' that respects this grading. We generalize Khovanskii bases further by taking multiple valuations into account (MUVAK bases). We give algorithms in both cases.
  MUVAK bases appear in the computation of the Cox ring of a minimal model of a quotient singularity. Our algorithm is an improvement of an algorithm by Yamagishi in this situation.</description>

      <title>The Bruce-Roberts number of holomorphic 1-forms along complex analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the \textit{Bruce-Roberts number} for holomorphic 1-forms relative to complex analytic varieties. Our main result shows that the Bruce-Roberts number of a 1-form $\omega$ with respect to a complex analytic hypersurface $X$ with an isolated singularity can be expressed in terms of the \textit{Ebeling--Gusein-Zade index} of $\omega$ along $X$, the \textit{Milnor number} of $\omega$ and the \textit{Tjurina number} of $X$. This result allows us to recover known formulas for the Bruce-Roberts number of a holomorphic function along $X$ and to establish connections between this number, the radial index, and the local Euler obstruction of $\omega$ along $X$. Moreover, we present applications to both global and local holomorphic foliations in complex dimension two.</description>

Abstract: Let $E_{\lambda}$ be the Legendre family of elliptic curves with equation $Y^2=X(X-1)(X-\lambda)$. Given a curve $\mathcal{C}$, satisfying a condition on the degrees of some of its coordinates and parametrizing $m$ points $P_1, \ldots, P_m \in E_{\lambda}$ and $n$ points $Q_1, \ldots, Q_n \in E_{\mu}$ and assuming that those points are generically linearly independent over the generic endomorphism ring, we prove that there are at most finitely many points $\mathbf{c}_0$ on $\mathcal{C}$, such that there exists an isogeny $\phi: E_{\mu(\mathbf{c}_0)} \rightarrow E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ and the $m+n$ points $P_1(\mathbf{c}_0), \ldots, P_m(\mathbf{c}_0), \phi(Q_1(\mathbf{c}_0)), \ldots, \phi(Q_n(\mathbf{c}_0)) \in E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)}$ are linearly dependent over $\mathrm{End}(E_{\lambda(\mathbf{c}_0)})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a 4th order 3-dimensional cyclic symmetric tensor, a sufficient and necessary condition is bulit for its positive semi-definiteness. A sufficient and necessary condition of positive definiteness is showed for a 4th order $n$-dimensional symmetric tensor. With the help of such a condition, the positive definiteness of a class of 4th order 3-dimensional cyclic symmetric tensors is given. Moreover, the positive definiteness of a class of non-cyclic symmetric tensors is showed also. By applying these conclusions, several (strict) inequalities are erected for ternary quartic homogeneous polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <title>Extended Karpenko and Karpenko-Merkurjev theorems for quasilinear quadratic forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $q$ be anisotropic quasilinear quadratic forms over a field $F$ of characteristic $2$, and let $i$ be the isotropy index of $q$ after scalar extension to the function field of the affine quadric with equation $p=0$. In this article, we establish a strong constraint on $i$ in terms of the dimension of $q$ and two stable birational invariants of $p$, one of which is the well-known "Izhboldin dimension", and the other of which is a new invariant that we denote $\Delta(p)$. Examining the contribution from the Izhboldin dimension, we obtain a result that unifies and extends the quasilinear analogues of two fundamental results on the isotropy of non-singular quadratic forms over function fields of quadrics in arbitrary characteristic due to Karpenko and Karpenko-Merkurjev, respectively. This proves in a strong way the quasilinear case of a general conjecture previously formulated by the author, suggesting that a substantial refinement of this conjecture should hold.</description>

Abstract: Tikhomirov (2009) proved the irreducibility of the moduli space of mathematical instantons on the projective 3-space for all odd charges. The irreducibility for charges between 1 and 5 was known before. In the present paper, the rationality of the instanton moduli spaces is proved under the assumption of the irreducibility. So, in particular, the instanton moduli spaces are rational for all odd charges and for charges 2 and 4.</description>

      <title>Counting positive intersection points of a trinomial and a $\mathbf{T}$-nomial curves via Groethendieck's dessin d'enfant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider real polynomial systems $f=g=0$ in two variables where $f$ has $t\geq 3$ monomial terms and $g$ has $3$ monomials terms. We prove that the number of positive isolated solutions of such a system does not exceed $3\cdot 2^{t-2} - 1$. This improves the bound $2^t - 2$ obtained in [T.-Y. Li, J.-M. Rojas and X. Wang, 2003]. This also refines for $t=4,\ldots,9$ the bound $2t^3/3 + 5t$ obtained in [P. Koiran, N. Portier and S. Tavenas, 2015]. Our proof is based on a delicate analysis of the Groethendieck's dessin d'enfant associated to some rational function determined by the system. For $t=3$, it was shown in [T.-Y. Li, J.-M. Rojas and X. Wang, 2003] that the sharp bound is five, and if this bound is reached, then the Minkowski sum of the associated Newton triangles is an hexagon. A further analysis of Groethendieck's dessin d'enfant allows us to show that if the bound five is reached, then there exist two consecutive edges of the hexagon which are translate of two consecutive edges of one Newton triangle.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian tens of planes, Enriques surfaces and holomorphic symplectic fourfolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1906.01445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fano models of Enriques surfaces produce a family of tens of mutually intersecting planes in $\mathbf P^5$ with a $10$-dimensional moduli space. The latter is linked to several 10-dimensional moduli spaces parametrizing other types of objects: a) cubic fourfolds containing the tens of planes, b) Beauville--Donagi holomorphically symplectic fourfolds, and c) double EPW sextics. The varieties in b) parametrize lines on cubic fourfolds from a). The double EPW sextics are associated, via O'Grady's construction, to Lagrangian subspaces of the Pl\"ucker space of the Grassmannian $Gr(2,\mathbf P^5)$ spanned by 10 mutually intersecting planes in $\mathbf P^5$. These links imply the irreducibility of the moduli space of supermarked Enriques surfaces, where a supermarking is a choice of a minimal generating system of the Picard group of the surface. Also some results are obtained on the variety of tens of mutually intersecting planes, not necessarily associated to Fano models of Enriques surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.01890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I coined the term anabelomorphy (pronounced as anabel-o-morphy) as a concise way of expressing Mochizuki's idea of "anabelian way of changing ground field, rings etc." which was he has introduced in his work on his Inter-Universal Teichmuller Theory. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of this idea by studying its ramifications in the more familiar arithmetic contexts such as the theory of Galois representations, automorphic forms and related areas and establish a number of results which are of independent arithmetic interest. I also introduce the notion of anabelomorphically connected number fields in which two number fields are related by the existence of topological isomorphism between the local Galois groups at a finite list of primes of both the number fields and prove some results illustrating arithmetic consequences of this notion. The Introduction provides a detailed discussion and summary of all the results proved in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We classify families of free rational curves on all smooth Fano threefolds over the complex numbers. In particular, we prove the family of very free rational curves representing any fixed numerical curve class is either irreducible or empty. This proves Geometric Manin's Conjecture in dimension three. For general Fano threefolds of each deformation type, our results allow us to explicitly count the number of components of the moduli space of irreducible, geometrically rational curves, which may not be free, representing any numerical class.</description>

Abstract: Let $Z\subset Fl(n)$ be the closure of a generic torus orbit in the full flag variety. Anderson-Tymoczko express the cohomology class of $Z$ as a sum of classes of Richardson varieties. Harada-Horiguchi-Masuda-Park give a decomposition of the permutohedron, the moment map image of $Z$, into subpolytopes corresponding to the summands of the Anderson-Tymoczko formula. We construct an explicit toric degeneration inside $Fl(n)$ of $Z$ into Richardson varieties, whose moment map images coincide with the HHMP decomposition, thereby obtaining a new proof of the Anderson-Tymoczko formula.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a complete classification of torus-invariant curves in Cherkis bow varieties of type A. We develop combinatorial codes for compact and noncompact invariant curves involving the butterfly diagrams, Young diagrams, and binary contingency tables. As a key intermediate step, we also develop a novel tangent weight formula. Finally, we apply this new machinery to example bow varieties to demonstrate how to obtain their 1-skeletons (union of fixed points and invariant curves).</description>

Abstract: Kashiwara, Polesello, Schapira and D'Agnolo defined canonical deformation quantizations of a holomorphic symplectic manifold and a holomorphic Lagrangian submanifold equipped with an orientation data. The goal of this paper is to use deformation quantization modules to construct a Fukaya-like category of holomorphic Lagrangians, resolving a conjecture of Joyce. Our main result describes the RHom complex between two such deformation quantization modules associated to a pair of Lagrangian submanifolds in terms of the derived geometry of the Lagrangian intersection. Namely, we identify the RHom complex with the DT sheaf associated to the d-critical structure on the Lagrangian intersection. Via a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence this describes the RHom complex in the category of microsheaves of sheaf quantizations of conic holomorphic Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'e theory via cohomology classifying stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply stack theoretic ideas to the classification problem in Dieudonn\'e theory. First, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonn\'e module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence, we give a new, much shorter proof of the isomorphism $\sigma^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base can be classified in terms of ``prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges", which we introduce by making constructions using (higher) classifying stacks. The latter generalizes the result of Ansch\"utz and Le Bras on classification of $p$-divisible groups, which we also reprove using our approach. Along the way, we prove a description of cohomology with coefficients in group schemes, compatibility with Cartier duality, and reconstruction of Galois representations in terms of our prismatic Dieudonn\'e $F$-gauges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebro-geometric or non-archimedean framework to study bubbling phenomena of Kahler metrics with Euclidean volume growth, after [DS17, Sun23, dBS23]. In particular, for any degenerating family to log terminal singularity, we algebraically construct a finite sequence of birational modifications of the family with milder degenerations, and compare with analytic bubbling constructions in loc.cit. We also provide approaches in terms of coordinates and valuations. Our discussion partially depends on the general framework of stability theory in our [Od24b] (arXiv:2406.02489) after [HL14, AHLH23].</description>

      <title>On the distribution of non-rigid families in the moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Shafarevich conjecture, we introduce the notions of very general rigidity and generic rigidity to characterize the distribution of non-rigid families in the corresponding moduli space. Our main results focus on moduli spaces of polarized manifolds where the infinitesimal Torelli theorem holds. We show that if the derived Mumford-Tate group of the associated polarized $\mathbb{Z}$-variation of Hodge structures is absolutely simple, then the moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ has the very general rigidity property, meaning all non-rigid families are contained within a countable union of closed strict irreducible subschemes of $\mathcal{M}$. If, in addition, the associated Mumford-Tate domain is not a bounded symmetric domain of rank greater than one, then the moduli space exhibits a stronger rigidity property, generic rigidity, where the countable union in the definition of very general rigidity is replaced by a finite union. As a corollary of the generic rigidity, we establish a geometric version of the Bombieri-Lang-type finiteness result. Many examples of moduli spaces, such as those of projective hypersurfaces of certain degrees, satisfy the conditions of our main theorems. We also explore the relationship between the bases of maximally non-rigid families and special subvarieties in the moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau manifolds, inspired by a detailed analysis of Viehweg-Zuo's example of maximally non-rigid families of Calabi-Yau quintics in $\mathbb{P}^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the behaviour of a free conic-line arrangement with respect to the deletion, respectively addition, of a smooth conic. Along the way we derive some restrictions on the geometry of the conic-line arrangement, induced by the freeness property. We show the same behaviour with respect to the deletion-addition of a smooth conic extends to general free reduced curves in the complex projective plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two real algebraic varieties X and Y, we denote by R(X,Y) the set of all regular maps from X to Y. The set R(X,Y) is regarded as a topological subspace of the space C(X,Y) of all continuous maps from X to Y endowed with the compact-open topology. We prove, in a much more general setting than previously considered, that each path component of C(X,Y) contains at most one path component of R(X,Y), and for every positive integer k the inclusion map R(X,Y)--&gt;C(X,Y) induces an isomorphism between the kth homotopy groups of the corresponding path components. We also identify several cases where this inclusion map is a weak homotopy equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We determine a simple expression of the Picard-Fuchs system for a family of Kummer surfaces for all principally polarized Abelian surfaces. It is given by a system of linear partial differential equations in three variables of rank five.

      <description>arXiv:2408.15893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth variety over a field $K$ with function field $K(X)$. Using the interpretation of the torsion part of the \'etale cohomology group $H_{\text{\'et}}^2(K(X), \mathbb{G}_m)$ in terms of Milnor-Quillen algebraic $K$-group $K_2(K(X))$, we prove that under mild conditions on the norm maps along unramified extensions of $K(X)$ over $X$, there exist cohomological Brauer classes in $H_{\text{\'et}}^2(X, \mathbb{G}_m)$ that are representable by Azumaya algebras on $X$. Theses conditions are almost satisfied in the case of number fields, providing then, a partial answer on a question of Grothendieck.</description>

      <title>Most Odd-Degree Binary Forms Fail to Primitively Represent a Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a separable integral binary form of odd degree $N \geq 5$. A result of Darmon and Granville known as ``Faltings plus epsilon'' implies that the degree-$N$ \emph{superelliptic equation} $y^2 = F(x,z)$ has finitely many primitive integer solutions. In this paper, we consider the family $\mathscr{F}_N(f_0)$ of degree-$N$ superelliptic equations with fixed leading coefficient $f_0 \in \mathbb{Z} \smallsetminus \pm\mathbb{Z}^2$, ordered by height. For every sufficiently large $N$, we prove that among equations in the family $\mathscr{F}_N(f_0)$, more than $74.9\%$ are insoluble, and more than $71.8\%$ are everywhere locally soluble but fail the Hasse principle due to the Brauer--Manin obstruction. We further show that these proportions rise to at least $99.9\%$ and $96.7\%$, respectively, when $f_0$ has sufficiently many prime divisors of odd multiplicity. Our result can be viewed as a strong asymptotic form of ``Faltings plus epsilon'' for superelliptic equations and constitutes an analogue of Bhargava's result that most hyperelliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ have no rational points.</description>

      <title>Mod $p$ points on Shimura varieties of parahoric level (with an appendix by Rong Zhou)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.10496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mod $p$-points of the Kisin--Pappas integral models of Shimura varieties of Hodge type with parahoric level. We show that if the group is quasi-split, then every isogeny class contains the reduction of a CM point, proving a conjecture of Kisin--Madapusi-Pera--Shin. We furthermore show that the mod $p$ isogeny classes are of the form predicted by the Langlands--Rapoport conjecture if either the Shimura variety is proper or if the group at $p$ is unramified. The main ingredient in our work is a global argument that allows us to reduce the conjecture to the case of very special parahoric level. This case is dealt with in the appendix by Rong Zhou. As a corollary to our arguments, we determine the connected components of Ekedahl--Oort strata.</description>

      <title>A hyperelliptic saga on a generating function of the squares of Legendre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We decompose the generating function $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{2n}nP_n(y)^2z^n$ of the squares of Legendre polynomials as a product of periods of hyperelliptic curves. These periods satisfy a family of $\textit{second}$ order differential equations. This is highly unusual since $\textit{four}$ is the expected order for genus 2. These second order equations are arithmetic and yet, surprisingly, their monodromy group is dense in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$. This suggests that they cannot be solved in terms of hypergeometric functions, which is novel for arithmetic second order differential equations that are $\textit{defined over}$ $\mathbb{Q}$, and also novel for a $\textit{family}$ of such equations. We complement our analysis with a recipe for constructing similar examples.

Abstract: In a survey paper in 2011, Amiot proposed a conjectural characterisation of the cluster categories which were conceived in the mid 2000s to lift the combinatorics of Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras to the categorical level. This paper is devoted to a proof of (a variant of) her conjecture. More generally, cluster categories admit higher-dimensional and relative variants, the so-called Higgs categories recently introduced by Wu. We also prove higher-dimensional and relative variants of the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13926v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Floer theory of equivariant Lagrangian correspondences and apply it to deduce a conjecture of Teleman, which finds the relation between the disc potential of an invariant Lagrangian submanifold and that of its quotient. A main step is to extend Fukaya's construction of an $A_\infty$ tri-module for Lagrangian correspondences to Borel spaces. We find that the equivariant obstruction of a Lagrangian correspondence plays an essential role, which leads to quantum corrections in the disc potentials of quotients. We solve the obstruction in the toric setup and find the relation with mirror maps for compact semi-Fano toric manifolds.</description>
