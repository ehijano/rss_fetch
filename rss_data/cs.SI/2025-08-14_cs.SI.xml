      <title>Exploring Content and Social Connections of Fake News with Explainable Text and Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global spread of misinformation and concerns about content trustworthiness have driven the development of automated fact-checking systems. Since false information often exploits social media dynamics such as "likes" and user networks to amplify its reach, effective solutions must go beyond content analysis to incorporate these factors. Moreover, simply labelling content as false can be ineffective or even reinforce biases such as automation and confirmation bias. This paper proposes an explainable framework that combines content, social media, and graph-based features to enhance fact-checking. It integrates a misinformation classifier with explainability techniques to deliver complete and interpretable insights supporting classification decisions. Experiments demonstrate that multimodal information improves performance over single modalities, with evaluations conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Additionally, the framework's explanations were assessed for interpretability, trustworthiness, and robustness with a novel protocol, showing that it effectively generates human-understandable justifications for its predictions.</description>

      <title>SABIA: An AI-Powered Tool for Detecting Opioid-Related Behaviors on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become valuable tools for understanding public health challenges by offering insights into patient behaviors, medication use, and mental health issues. However, analyzing such data remains difficult due to the prevalence of informal language, slang, and coded communication, which can obscure the detection of opioid misuse. This study addresses the issue of opioid-related user behavior on social media, including informal expressions, slang terms, and misspelled or coded language. We analyzed the existing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) technique and developed a BERT-BiLSTM-3CNN hybrid deep learning model, named SABIA, to create a single-task classifier that effectively captures the features of the target dataset. The SABIA model demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing semantics and contextual information. The proposed approach includes: (1) data preprocessing, (2) data representation using the SABIA model, (3) a fine-tuning phase, and (4) classification of user behavior into five categories. A new dataset was constructed from Reddit posts, identifying opioid user behaviors across five classes: Dealers, Active Opioid Users, Recovered Users, Prescription Users, and Non-Users, supported by detailed annotation guidelines. Experiments were conducted using supervised learning. Results show that SABIA achieved benchmark performance, outperforming the baseline (Logistic Regression, LR = 0.86) and improving accuracy by 9.30%. Comparisons with seven previous studies confirmed its effectiveness and robustness. This study demonstrates the potential of hybrid deep learning models for detecting complex opioid-related behaviors on social media, supporting public health monitoring and intervention efforts.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Multi-layer Social Networks Based on Differentiated Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes is crucial in social network analysis. Existing methods often neglect local opinion leader tendencies, resulting in overlapping influence ranges for seed nodes. Furthermore, approaches based on vanilla graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to effectively aggregate influence characteristics during message passing, particularly with varying influence intensities. Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer nature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this paper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method leveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships using a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence propagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node embeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an adaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This mechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message passing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to effectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer diffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer social network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Online Homogeneity Can Emerge Without Filtering Algorithms or Homophily Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideologically homogeneous online environments - often described as "echo chambers" or "filter bubbles" - are widely seen as drivers of polarization, radicalization, and misinformation. A central debate asks whether such homophily stems primarily from algorithmic curation or users' preference for like-minded peers. This study challenges that view by showing that homogeneity can emerge in the absence of both filtering algorithms and user preferences. Using an agent-based model inspired by Schelling's model of residential segregation, we demonstrate that weak individual preferences, combined with simple group-based interaction structures, can trigger feedback loops that drive communities toward segregation. Once a small imbalance forms, cascades of user exits and regrouping amplify homogeneity across the system. Counterintuitively, algorithmic filtering - often blamed for "filter bubbles" - can in fact sustain diversity by stabilizing mixed communities. These findings highlight online polarization as an emergent system-level dynamic and underscore the importance of applying a complexity lens to the study of digital public spheres.</description>

      <title>CS-Agent: LLM-based Community Search via Dual-agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks, yet their application to graph structure analysis, particularly in community search, remains underexplored. Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications.</description>
