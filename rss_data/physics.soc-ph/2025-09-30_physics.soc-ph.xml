      <title>A consistent SIR model on time scales with exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new dynamic SIR model that, in contrast with the available model on time scales, is biological relevant. For the new SIR model we obtain an explicit solution, we prove the asymptotic stability of the extinction and disease-free equilibria, and deduce some necessary conditions for the monotonic behavior of the infected population. The new results are illustrated with several examples in the discrete, continuous, and quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Decoding the city: multiscale spatial information of urban income</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities are characterized by the coexistence of general aggregate patterns, along with many local variations. This poses challenges for analyses of urban phenomena, which tend to be either too aggregated or too local, depending on the disciplinary approach. Here, we use methods from statistical learning theory to develop a general methodology for quantifying how much information is encoded in the spatial structure of cities at different scales. We illustrate the approach via the multiscale analysis of income distributions in over 900 US metropolitan areas. By treating the formation of diverse neighborhood structures as a process of spatial selection, we quantify the complexity of explanation needed to account for personal income heterogeneity observed across all US urban areas and each of their neighborhoods. We find that spatial selection is strongly dependent on income levels with richer and poorer households appearing spatially more segregated than middle-income groups. We also find that different neighborhoods present different degrees of income specificity and inequality, motivating analysis and theory beyond averages. Our findings emphasize the importance of multiscalar statistical methods that both coarse-grain and fine-grain data to bridge local to global theories of cities and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Network Inequality through Preferential Attachment, Triadic Closure, and Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequalities in social networks arise from linking mechanisms, such as preferential attachment (connecting to popular nodes), homophily (connecting to similar others), and triadic closure (connecting through mutual contacts). While preferential attachment mainly drives degree inequality and homophily drives segregation, their three-way interaction remains understudied. This gap limits our understanding of how network inequalities emerge. Here, we introduce PATCH, a network growth model combining the three mechanisms to understand how they create disparities among two groups in synthetic networks. Extensive simulations confirm that homophily and preferential attachment increase segregation and degree inequalities, while triadic closure has countervailing effects: conditional on the other mechanisms, it amplifies population-wide degree inequality while reducing segregation and between-group degree disparities. We demonstrate PATCH's explanatory potential on fifty years of Physics and Computer Science collaboration and citation networks exhibiting persistent gender disparities. PATCH accounts for these gender disparities with the joint presence of preferential attachment, moderate gender homophily, and varying levels of triadic closure. By connecting mechanisms to observed inequalities, PATCH shows how their interplay sustains group disparities and provides a framework for designing interventions that promote more equitable social networks.</description>

      <title>Robustness of 'small' networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling how networks change under structural perturbations can yield foundational insights into network robustness, which is critical in many real-world applications. The largest connected component is a popular measure of network performance. Percolation theory provides a theoretical framework to establish statistical properties of the largest connected component of large random graphs. However, this theoretical framework is typically only exact in the large-$\nodes$ limit, failing to capture the statistical properties of largest connected components in small networks, which many real-world networks are. We derive expected values for the largest connected component of small $G(\nodes,p)$ random graphs from which nodes are either removed uniformly at random or targeted by highest degree and compare these values with existing theory. We also visualize the performance of our expected values compared to existing theory for predicting the largest connected component of various real-world, small graphs.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Cascade Sizes of Stopped Projects in SourceForge: Is SOC Theory Applicable to OSSOCs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on three rounds of data extraction, we first construct complex network models to identify the cascade sizes of stopped projects and their distributions in SourceForge (March 2000 to February 2013). We then analyze and discover characteristics of these cascade sizes and their distributions: most cascade sizes are 1; two extreme sizes coexist; and the cascade sizes in each Period of SourceForge's peak phase exhibit a power-law distribution while lacking scale-free properties. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this study and their implications for Self-Organized Criticality theory.</description>

      <title>Predictability and Statistical Memory in Classical Sonatas and Quartets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical models and information theory have provided a useful set of tools for studying music from a quantitative perspective. These approaches have been employed to generate compositions, analyze structural patterns, and model cognitive processes that underlie musical perception. A common framework used in such studies is a Markov chain model, which models the probability of a musical event -- such as a note, chord, or rhythm -- based on a sequence of preceding events. While many studies focus on first-order models, relatively few have used more complex models to systematically compare across composers and compositional forms. In this study, we examine statistical dependencies in classical sonatas and quartets using higher-order Markov chains fit to sequences of top notes. Our data set of 605 MIDI files comprises piano sonatas and string quartets by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, and Schubert, from which we analyze sequences of top notes. We probe statistical dependencies using three distinct methods: Markov chain fits, time-delayed mutual information, and mixture transition distribution analysis. We find that, in general, the statistical dependencies in Mozart's music notably differ from that of the other three composers. Markov chain models of higher order provide significantly better fits than low-order models for Beethoven, Haydn, and Schubert, but not for Mozart. At the same time, we observe nuances across compositional forms and composers: for example, in the string quartets, certain metrics yield comparable results for Mozart and Beethoven. Broadly, our study extends the analysis of statistical dependencies in music, and highlights systematic distinctions in the predictability of sonatas and quartets from different classical composers. These findings motivate future work comparing across composers for other musical forms, or in other eras, cultures, or musical traditions.</description>

      <title>Controlling sternness in judging a good person who helps the bad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on indirect reciprocity with private assessment on complete graphs suggest the possibility that one can continuously modulate the degree of segregation by controlling how to judge a good person helping a bad one. A well-known social norm called L6 judges it as bad, which eventually segregates the society into two antagonistic clusters, but if it is judged as good, the system reaches paradise where everyone likes each other. In this work, we numerically study this transition between segregation and paradise in two different settings. Firstly, in a uniform population of size $N$ where everyone regards such a donor as good with probability $p$ and bad with $1-p$, we observe paradise when $Np$ is sufficiently greater than $O(1)$. In contrast, in a heterogeneous setting where only $k$ individuals judge such a donor as good, the size difference of the clusters increases almost linearly as $k$ increases, so paradise can only be reached as $k \to N$ in a large population. Therefore, when an urgent change is needed to overcome the segregation due to L6, a small change in each and every individual's behavior is more efficient than a radical change in a fraction of the population.</description>

      <title>When Simple is Enough, Binary Models Capture Social Complexity in Coupled Human-Environment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of coupled human-environment systems often face a tradeoff between realism and tractability. Spectrum opinion models, where social preferences vary continuously, offer descriptive richness but are computationally demanding and parameter-heavy. Binary formulations, in contrast, are analytically simpler but raise concerns about whether they can capture key socio-ecological feedbacks. Here we systematically compare binary and spectrum social models across four benchmark settings: (i) replicator dynamics coupled to a climate-carbon system, (ii) FJ opinion dynamics coupled to the climate-carbon system, (iii) replicator dynamics coupled to a forest-grassland ecological system, and (iv) FJ opinion dynamics coupled to a forest-grassland ecological system. We employ the relative integrated absolute error (RIAE) to quantify deviations between binary (N=2) and spectrum (N=100) formulations of social opinion dynamics in feedback with ecological subsystems. Across systematic parameter sweeps of learning rates, reluctance, conformity, susceptibility, runaway amplitudes, and ecological turnover, the binary formulation typically tracks its spectrum counterpart to within 15 percent for most parameter combinations. Deviations beyond this arise mainly under very high social susceptibility or near-vanishing ecological turnover, where additional opinion modes and nonlinear feedbacks matter. We therefore present the binary formulation as a practical surrogate, not a universal replacement. As a rule of thumb, it is adequate when susceptibility is moderate, ecological turnover appreciable, and runaway amplitudes not extreme; in high-susceptibility or low-turnover regimes, especially near critical transitions, the full-spectrum model is preferable. This framing guides readers on when a binary reduction is sufficient versus when full-spectrum detail is warranted.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Network Geometry Influences Diffusion Processes in Complex Networks: A Focus on Cryptocurrency Blockchains and Critical Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides essential insights into how diffusion processes unfold in complex networks, with a focus on cryptocurrency blockchains and infrastructure networks. The structural properties of these networks, such as hub-dominated, heavy-tailed topology, network motifs, and node centrality, significantly influence diffusion speed and reach. Using epidemic diffusion models, specifically the Kertesz threshold model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, we analyze key factors affecting diffusion dynamics. To assess the uncertainty in the fraction of infected nodes over time, we employ bootstrap confidence intervals, while Bayesian credible intervals are constructed to quantify parameter uncertainties in the SI models. Our findings reveal substantial variations across different network types, including Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi networks, Geometric Random Graphs, and Delaunay Triangulation networks, emphasizing the role of network architecture in failure propagation. We identify that network motifs are crucial in diffusion. We highlight that hub-dominated networks, which dominate blockchain ecosystems, provide resilience against random failures but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, posing significant risks to network stability. Furthermore, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient strongly influence the transmissibility of diffusion in both blockchain and critical infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>How LLMs Learn to Reason: A Complex Network Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of One-to-Many Interdependent Higher-order Networks Against Cascading Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, the stable operation of a network is usually inseparable from the mutual support of other networks. In such an interdependent network, a node in one layer may depend on multiple nodes in another layer, forming a complex one-to-many dependency relationship. Meanwhile, there may also be higher-order interactions between multiple nodes within a layer, which increases the connectivity within the layer. However, existing research on one-to-many interdependence often neglects intra-layer higher-order structures and lacks a unified theoretical framework for inter-layer dependencies. Moreover, current research on interdependent higher-order networks typically assumes idealized one-to-one inter-layer dependencies, which does not reflect the complexity of real-world systems. These limitations hinder a comprehensive understanding of how such networks withstand failures. Therefore, this paper investigates the robustness of one-to-many interdependent higher-order networks under random attacks. Depending on whether node survival requires at least one dependency edge or multiple dependency edges, we propose four inter-layer interdependency conditions and analyze the network's robustness after cascading failures induced by random attacks. Using percolation theory, we establish a unified theoretical framework that reveals how higher-order interaction structures within intra-layers and inter-layer coupling parameters affect network reliability and system resilience. Additionally, we extend our study to partially interdependent hypergraphs. We validate our theoretical analysis on both synthetic and real-data-based interdependent hypergraphs, offering insights into the optimization of network design for enhanced reliability.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of problematic papers in the field of non-coding RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the surge in retractions has been accompanied by numerous papers receiving comments that raise concerns about their reliability. The prevalence of problematic papers undermines the reliability of scientific research and threatens the foundation of evidence-based medicine. In this study,we focus on the field of non-coding RNA(ncRNA) as a case study to explore the typical characteristics of problematic papers from various perspectives, aiming to provide insights for addressing large-scale fraudulent publications. Research on under-investigated ncRNAs is more likely to yield problematic papers. These problematic papers often exhibit significant textual similarity, and many others sharing this similarity also display suspicious instances of image duplication. Healthcare institutions are particularly prone to publishing problematic papers, especially those with a low publication volume. Most problematic papers are found in a limited number of journals, and many journals inadequately address the commented papers. Our findings suggest that numerous problematic papers may still remain unidentified. The revealed characteristics offer valuable insights for formulating strategies to address the issue of fraudulent papers at scale.</description>

      <title>Community detection robustness of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph-SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturbations associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Research in Medicine: Journal ranking vs. Interdisciplinarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Approach to (Meta)Relational Models Theory, and its Application to Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) -- Towards Social Relations Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the optimal nature of social interactions among actors (e.g., people or firms), who seek to achieve certain mutually-agreed objectives, has been the subject of extensive academic research. Using the relational models theory (describing all social interactions as combinations of four basic sociality ingredients: Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing), the common approach revolves around qualitative arguments for determining sociality configurations most effective in realizing specific purposes, at times supplemented by empirical data. In the current treatment, we formulate this question as a mathematical optimization problem, in order to quantitatively derive the most suitable combination of sociality forms for dyadic actors, which optimizes their mutually-agreed objective. For this purpose, we develop an analytical framework of the (meta)relational models theory, and demonstrate that combining the four sociality forms to define a specific meaningful social situation inevitably prompts an inherent tension among them, codified by a single elementary and universal metarelation. In analogy with financial portfolio management, we subsequently introduce the concept of Social Relations Portfolio (SRP) management, and propose a generalizable methodology capable of quantitatively identifying the efficient SRP, which, in turn, enables effective stakeholder and change management initiatives. As an important illustration, the methodology is applied to the Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) paradigm to derive its efficient SRP. This serves as a guide to practitioners for precisely measuring, monitoring, reporting and steering stakeholder and change management efforts concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) within and / or across organizations.</description>

      <title>Compact 15-minute cities are greener</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 15-minute city concept, which advocates for cities where essential services are accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, despite being celebrated for promoting sustainability, large-scale empirical evaluations of the effectiveness of the 15-minute concept in reducing emissions are lacking. To address this gap, we investigate whether cities with better walking accessibility, like 15-minute cities, are associated with lower transportation emissions. Comparing 664 cities worldwide, we find that cities with better walking accessibility to services emit less CO$_2$ per capita for transport. Moreover, we observe that among cities with similar average accessibility, those that span larger areas tend to emit more. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of decentralised urban planning, especially the proximity-based 15-minute city, in promoting sustainable mobility. However, they also emphasise the need to integrate local accessibility with urban compactness and efficient public transit, which are vital in large cities.</description>

      <title>Winning Opinion in the Voter Model: Following Your Friends' Advice or That of Their Friends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a variation of the classical voter model in which the set of influencing agents depends on an individual's current opinion. The initial population consists of a random sample of equally sized sub-populations for each state, and two types of interactions are considered: (i) direct neighbors, and (ii) second neighbors (friends of direct neighbors, excluding the direct neighbors themselves). The neighborhood size, reflecting regular network connectivity, is kept constant across all agents. Our findings reveal that varying the interaction range introduces asymmetries that influence the probability of consensus and convergence time. At low connectivity, direct neighbor interactions dominate, driving consensus. As connectivity increases, the probability of consensus for either state becomes equal, mirroring symmetric dynamics. It is shown that this asymmetric effect on the probability of consensus is independent of the network topology in small-world and scale-free networks. Asymmetry is also reflected in convergence time: while symmetric cases show decreasing times with increased connectivity, asymmetric cases exhibit an almost linear increase. Contrary to the probability of achieving consensus, the effect of asymmetry on the consensus time does depend on the network topology. The introduction of stubborn agents further accentuates these effects, particularly when they favor the less dominant state, significantly increasing consensus time. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for decision-making processes and political campaigns in human populations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order shortest paths in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Polarisation in increasingly connected societies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explanations of polarization often rely on one of the three mechanisms: homophily, bounded confidence, and community-based interactions. Models based on these mechanisms consider the lack of interactions as the main cause of polarization. Given the increasing connectivity in modern society, this explanation of polarization may be insufficient. We aim to show that in involvement-based models, society becomes more polarized as its connectedness increases. To this end, we propose a minimal voter-type model (called I-voter) that incorporates involvement as a key mechanism in opinion formation and study its dependence on network connectivity. We describe the steady-state behaviour of the model analytically, at the mean-field and the moment-hierarchy levels and stress the generality of our findings by considering various extensions and different network topologies.</description>

Abstract: While paradoxical linkages famously violate the Chebyshev-Grubler-Kutzbach criterion by exhibiting unexpected mobility, we identify an opposing phenomenon: a class of linkages that appear mobile according to the same criterion, yet are in fact rigid. We refer to these as hypo-paradoxical linkages, and proceed to analyze and illustrate their behavior. We use the same tools to further explain the unexpected positive mobility of Bennet mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Physics of Wealth Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asset exchange models (AEMs) provide a physics-inspired framework for studying wealth formation. These models capture wealth distribution dynamics via pairwise money exchanges, yielding steady-state distributions from exponential to heavy-tailed power laws. However, empirical validation remains limited due to scarce real-world transaction data. Here, we bridge this gap by analyzing spectral properties of Markov transition matrices from both AEMs and Ethereum blockchain data, enabling quantitative comparison of model and empirical exchange dynamics. We assess thermodynamic equilibrium in exchange processes - specifically, detailed balance - and derive steady-state wealth distributions from transition matrices. We find that equilibrium systems' spectra contain only real eigenvalues and link Ethereum price changes to spectral shifts. We also investigate external factors (e.g., taxes), showing that advantages for richer individuals make wealth evolution path-dependent on initial distributions. Our work establishes a quantitative framework for validating AEMs with real data, advancing economic modeling and understanding of wealth formation.</description>

      <title>Network inference via process motifs for lagged correlation in linear stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a universal trajectory foundation model is a promising solution to address the limitations of existing trajectory modeling approaches, such as task specificity, regional dependency, and data sensitivity. Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading over populations networks has been an important subject of research for several decades, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most epidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their spreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a pathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We consider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and study the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use analytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the conditions for it to spread. We also use numerical simulations to study the pathogen flow in this case, and to understand the mutation phenomena. We show that the natural selection leads to less violent pathogens becoming predominant in the population. We discuss a wide range of network structures and show how different effects are manifested in each case. We also applied our theory in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, using relevant epidemiological data collected for this outbreak. We provided explanations for the variants spreading processes observed throughout this pandemic.</description>

      <title>From group stage to league format: The impact of the draw in European football's Champions League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental reform has been introduced in the 2024/25 season of club competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA): the well-established group stage has been replaced by an incomplete round-robin format. In this format, the 36 teams are ranked in a single league table, but play against only a subset of the competitors. While this innovative change has highlighted that the incomplete round-robin tournament is a reasonable alternative to the standard design of allocating the teams into round-robin groups, the characteristics of the new format remain unexplored. Our paper contributes to this topic by using simulations to compare the uncertainty generated by the draw in the old format with that in the new format of the UEFA Champions League. We develop a method to break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components for each team. The new format is found to decrease the overall effect of the draw. However, this reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. If the teams are seeded based on their actual strengths, the impact of the draw is about the same in a tournament with an incomplete round-robin league or a group stage.</description>
