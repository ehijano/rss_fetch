      <title>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Swampland: The Cosmologist's Handbook to the string-theoretical Swampland Programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory has strong implications for cosmology: it tells us that we cannot have a cosmological constant, that single-field slow-roll inflation is ruled out, and that black holes decay. We elucidate the origin of these statements within the string-theoretical swampland programme. The swampland programme is generating a growing body of insights that have yet to be incorporated into cosmological models. Taking a cosmologist's perspective, we highlight the relevance of swampland conjectures to black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, including their implications for scalar fields such as quintessence and axions. Our goal is to inspire cosmological model builders to examine the compatibility of effective field theories with quantum gravitational UV completions and to address outstanding cosmological tensions such as the Hubble tension. This comprehensive literature review presents clear definitions, cosmological implications, and the current status - including evidence and counterexamples - of the following swampland conjectures: the anti-de Sitter distance conjecture (AdSDC), the completeness conjecture (CC), the cobordism conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture (dSC), the swampland distance conjecture (SDC), the emergence proposal (EP), the Festina Lente Bound (FLB), the finite number of massless fields conjecture (or finite flux vacua conjecture (FFV)), the no global symmetries conjecture, the no non-supersymmetric theories conjecture, the non-negative null energy condition conjecture, the positive Gauss-Bonnet term conjecture, the species scale conjecture, the gravitino swampland conjecture (GSC), the tadpole conjecture, the tameness conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (tPCC/TCC), the unique geodesic conjecture, and the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), including the repulsive force conjecture (RFC).</description>

      <title>Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) &gt; a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Family Trees in Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-ordered multilayer integrals have long been cited as major challenges in the analytical study of cosmological correlators and wavefunction coefficients. The recently proposed family tree decomposition technique solved these time integrals in terms of canonical objects called family trees, which are multivariate hypergeometric functions with energies as variables and twists as parameters. In this work, we provide a systematic study of the analytical properties of family trees. By exploiting the great flexibility of Mellin representations of family trees, we identify and characterize all their singularities in both variables and parameters and find their exact series representations around all singularities with finite convergent domains. These series automatically generate analytical continuation of arbitrary family trees over many distinct regions in the energy space. As a corollary, we show the factorization of family trees at zero partial-energy singularities to all orders. Our findings offer essential analytical data for further understanding and computing cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Unitary and Analytic Renormalisation of Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop contributions to cosmological correlators and to the associated wavefunction are of key theoretical and phenomenological interest. Here, we investigate and compare different renormalisation schemes proposed in the literature to handle ultraviolet divergences and develop new schemes adapting $\eta$ regulators to de Sitter spacetime. We focus on one-loop contributions to the quadratic wavefunction coefficient of a shift-symmetric massless scalar in de Sitter spacetime, which is a good toy model of primordial curvature perturbations. We show that different implementations of dimensional regularisation agree with each other and with unitarity and scale invariance in the final renormalised result. Imposing unitarity in the form of the cosmological optical theorem, we define a class of unitary and analytic $\eta$ regulators that agree with dim reg but feature considerable technical and conceptual simplifications. We show that the imaginary part of all one-loop wavefunction coefficients is universally fixed in terms of the logarithmic running of the real part, under the assumptions of scale invariance, Bunch-Davies vacuum and light bulk fields. Our work resolves discrepancies in the literature, establishes regulator-independent predictions for the imaginary part at one loop, and provides a practical framework for computing quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Scattering of D0-branes and Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for about thirty years that a scattering amplitude involving D0-branes and closed strings suffers from infrared divergences beyond tree level. These divergences arise because the conventional world-sheet approach cannot account for the difference between the D0-brane's momentum before and after scattering. We show that, by using string field theory, the divergence can be removed and the amplitude rendered finite and unambiguous. We illustrate this using the simplest possible example in bosonic string theory: a three-point function with one incoming and one outgoing D0-brane and an incoming or outgoing closed string tachyon.</description>

      <title>Monodromy Relations for String Amplitudes on AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $AdS$ Veneziano amplitude describing the scattering of four gluons in type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^3$. We propose a set of powerful monodromy relations between different colour-ordered amplitudes. These relations arise as a consequence of the emergent world-sheet description of open string scattering on $AdS$. In flat space, they reduce to the usual monodromy relations for the Veneziano amplitude, and they hold order by order in the small curvature expansion. The relations hold for all results available in the literature, including the scattering of arbitrary KK-modes.</description>

      <title>$dS$ extremal surfaces, replicas, boundary Renyi entropies in $dS/CFT$ and time entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop further previous work on de Sitter extremal surfaces and time entanglement structures in quantum mechanics. In the first part, we first discuss explicit quotient geometries. Then we construct smooth bulk geometries with replica boundary conditions at the future boundary and evaluate boundary Renyi entropies in $dS/CFT$. The bulk calculation pertains to the semiclassical de Sitter Wavefunction and thus evaluates pseudo-Renyi entropies. In 3-dimensions, the geometry in quotient variables is Schwarzschild de Sitter. The 4-dim $dS$ geometry involves hyperbolic foliations and is a complex geometry satisfying a regularity criterion that amounts to requiring a smooth Euclidean continuation. Overall this puts on a firmer footing previous Lewkowycz-Maldacena replica arguments based on analytic continuation for the extremal surface areas via appropriate cosmic branes.
  In the second part (independent of de Sitter), we study various aspects of time entanglement in quantum mechanics, in particular the reduced time evolution operator, weak values of operators localized to subregions, a transition matrix operator with two copies of the time evolution operator, autocorrelation functions for operators localized to subregions, and finally future-past entangled states and factorization.</description>

      <title>Conformal bootstrap: from Polyakov to our times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.</description>

      <title>AdS$_7$ Black Holes and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the regularized on-shell action of the recently found asymptotically AdS$_7$ black hole supergravity solution with three angular momenta and two electric charges. We show that a particular choice of finite counterterms in the holographic renormalization procedure yields a result for the on-shell action of the supersymmetric limit of the black hole solution which is in perfect agreement with the large $N$ limit of the superconformal index of the dual 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ $A_{N}$ SCFT on $S^1\times S^5$. We also discuss a generalization of this 7d supergravity background to a new general family of black holes with horizons given by the $L^{p,q,r}$ 5d Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. The regularized on-shell action of these new 7d black holes is also in agreement with supersymmetric localization results for the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT on $S^1\times L^{p,q,r}$. Finally, we briefly discuss a generalization of known AdS$_5$ gauged supergravity backgrounds to new 5d black holes with $L(p,q)$ lens space horizon topologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for studying $d+1$ dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild black holes with Hawking temperature near the Hagedorn temperature and Horowitz-Polchinski solutions. The worldsheet theory that describes some of these backgrounds is strongly coupled. We use its underlying affine $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry to continue to weak coupling, by varying the level of the current algebra from the small value relevant for black holes and HP solutions to a large value. In this limit, one can describe the dynamics by a solvable effective field theory, and the non-geometric features of the original problem are geometrized. The resulting construction is closely related to previous work on the non-abelian Thirring model, and sheds light on both problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out that fermionic unitary operators which anticommute among themselves appear in various situations in quantum field theories with anomalies in the Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate, we give multiple derivations of the fact that position-dependent $U(1)$ transformations of two-dimensional theories with $U(1)$ symmetry of odd level are fermionic when the winding number is odd. We then relate this mechanism to the anomalies of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetry, whose description also crucially uses unitary operators which are fermionic. We also show that position-dependent $SU(2)$ transformations of four-dimensional theories with $SU(2)$ symmetry with Witten anomaly are fermionic and anticommute among themselves when the winding number is odd.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore strongly correlated materials with tilted Dirac cone by introducing a method to realize this spectral feature within a holographic setup. Following the work by Moradpouri et al., we construct an asymptotically AdS spacetime by uplifting the vielbein of Volovik et al to tilt the flat spacetime light cone. We then couple the resulting metric to holographic fermions and compute their spectral functions, confirming the presence of a tilted Dirac cone in momentum space. We also calculate the topological number using the holographic Green's function and find that the Chern number is independent of the tilting parameter. Additionally, we show that the optical conductivity exhibits a Drude peak even at zero chemical potential, revealing nontrivial strong-coupling effects absent in field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The perturbation of the symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4$ under the triplet of exactly marginal operators from the $2$-cycle twisted sector is studied in perturbation theory. We show that the structure of the triplet perturbation is very similar to that of the previously studied singlet perturbation, and in particular, that the theory remains also integrable in this case. Furthermore, using the various symmetries of the problem, we identify the dual supergravity interpretation of these deformations.</description>

      <title>Oscillons and bubbles in $Q$-ball dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in the thin-wall regime, $Q$-ball--anti-$Q$-ball collisions reveal chaotic behaviour. This is explained by the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the internal modes hosted by the $Q$-balls and by the existence of {\it ephemeral} states, that is unstable, sometimes even short-lived, field configurations that appear as intermediate states. The most important examples of such states are the {\it bubble} of the false broken vacuum, which as intermediate states govern the $QQ^*$ annihilation, and the {\it charged oscillons}.
  The usually short-lived bubble can be dynamically temporarily stabilized, which explains their importance in the dynamics of $Q$-balls. This happens due to the excitation of massless Goldstone modes, which, exerting pressure on the bubble boundaries or being trapped as bound modes, prevent the bubble from collapsing.</description>

      <title>Computing $c$- and $a$-functions from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the direct connection between entanglement entropy and the notion of irreversibility in the renormalization-group flow in the context of a simple theory for which a calculation from first principles is feasible. The change of the entanglement entropy for a spherical entangling surface as its radius grows from zero to infinity corresponds to the flow from the UV to the IR. Through analytical and numerical means, we compute the entanglement entropy for a free massive scalar theory, making use of the method of correlation functions. We deduce a $c$-function in $1+1$ dimensions and an $a$-function in $3+1$ dimensions. Both functions are monotonic and vary continuously between one and zero, as expected for this simple theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-instantons in 2d string theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instanton contributions in 2d string theory are known to include subtle numerical factors $\zeta_n$ closely related to a contour prescription in multi-instanton string amplitudes. Both ingredients appear to be ambiguous due to a degeneracy between $(1,n)$-ZZ instantons and $n$ (1,1)-ZZ instantons in the linear dilaton background. We resolve this ambiguity using insights from the dual matrix quantum mechanics where the multipliers $\zeta_n$ can be derived from an integral representation of the scattering phase and follow from the median resummation prescribed by resurgence theory. We evaluate multi-instanton string amplitudes in the theory compactified on a circle of finite radius for arbitrary number of instantons and show that they reproduce the matrix model predictions provided the Lorentzian contour prescription is used for their evaluation. We also show that the non-perturbative free energy matches the structure of the D-instanton induced string field theory effective action, which suggests the vanishing of contributions from worldsheet topologies of negative Euler number.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass: Extending the topological classification of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify a novel topological subclass, dubbed $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$, in the thermodynamics of higher odd-dimensional, multiply rotating Kerr-AdS black holes. This discovery extends the established topological classification beyond the five classes and two subclasses previously known. The $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass exhibits a unique and previously unreported stability profile: it admits a thermodynamically stable small black hole state in the low-temperature limit, while in the high-temperature limit, the phase space simultaneously contains one stable large black hole, one stable small black hole, and one unstable small black hole state. Our analysis, which treats black hole solutions as topological defects, reveals a richer landscape of black hole thermodynamics than previously understood and necessitates an expansion of the topological classification scheme to accommodate this new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Gravitating spinor torsional BTZ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact analytic solutions for a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory with matter fields in the adjoint representation (unconventional supersymmetry). The configurations correspond to gravitating spinor fields on BTZ geometries with torsion. Although the spinor profiles exhibit divergent behavior near the black hole horizon, they yield finite contributions to conserved charges. We demonstrate that the spinors solve the full nonlinear field equations and satisfy integrability conditions derived from the Bianchi identities. The resulting energy momentum tensor is traceless, consistent with the Weyl invariance of the theory. We also analyze spinor solutions based on $adS_3$ Killing spinors and identify the conditions under which such backgrounds can support nontrivial spinor configurations. Our findings open the way to new fermionic sectors in 3D gravity with torsion, distinct from previously known perturbative deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit gauge anomalies from the purely on-shell perspective. We argue that violation of anomaly cancellation conditions manifests as a breakdown of collinear factorization. We explicitly construct one-loop 5-point amplitudes with graviton exchange displaying singular behavior in collinear limits that cannot be reconciled with factorization theorems. In this approach, gravity serves as a universal probe of both abelian and non-abelian anomalies.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems: From the ice rule to supersymmetric fishnet Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis examines the correspondence between models of statistical physics and Feynman graphs of quantum field theories (QFTs) by a common property: integrability. We review integrable structures for periodic boundary conditions on both sides, while focusing on the eight- and six-vertex model and the bi-scalar fishnet theory. The latter is a double-scaled $\gamma$-deformation of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Interesting applications of integrability existing in the literature that we reconsider are the computation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit and its QFT counterpart, the critical coupling. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of the calculation of exact anomalous dimensions and operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients in the conformal bi-scalar fishnet theory. The original contributions of this work comprise the results of the critical coupling for models with fermions, the brick wall theory, and the fermionic fishnet theory. Additionally, we extend the study of integrable Feynman graphs to supersymmetric diagrams in superspace. By establishing an efficient graphical formalism, we obtain the critical coupling of double-scaled $\beta$-deformations of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory and Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory, the super brick wall and superfishnet theory, respectively. Moreover, we apply superspace methods to the superfishnet theory and find results for anomalous dimensions and an OPE coefficient, which are all-loop exact in the coupling. In addition, we study boundary integrability in the six-vertex model and for Feynman diagrams. We present new box-shaped boundary conditions for the six-vertex model and conjecture a closed form for its partition function at any lattice size. On the QFT side, we find integrable boundary scattering matrices in the form of generalized Feynman diagrams by graphical methods.</description>

      <title>Structure of renormalization constants for theories with multiple couplings in the MS-like subtraction schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For theories with multiple couplings we construct simple expressions for the four-dimensional (or, in general, integer-dimensional) renormalization constants assuming that all divergences are logarithmical. These expressions allow relating all coefficients at $\varepsilon$-poles, logarithms, and (if exist) mixed terms to the coefficients of the renormalization group functions in any order of the perturbation theory for MS-like renormalization prescriptions. The result admits such a formulation in that $\varepsilon$-poles and $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ enter on the same footing. For theories with two and three couplings we present explicit expressions for the pole/logarithm structure of renormalization constants in the lowest orders of the perturbation theory. They are verified by comparisons with the three-loop explicit calculations made previously for the $\varphi^4$-theory with two couplings.</description>

      <title>Modified Unruh Thermodynamics in Emergent Gravity: Finite Heat Capacity and R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of Einstein's equations remains valid when local Rindler horizons are treated as finite heat-capacity systems, resolving the unphysical infinite-bath assumption of standard Unruh thermodynamics. The resulting entropy takes the form of R\'enyi entropy with nonextensivity parameter $\lambda\sim C^{-1}$, or equivalently, a new "Einstein entropy" that exactly preserves the Einstein equations for all heat capacities. In both cases, the Unruh temperature is modified as \begin{equation*}
  T_\text{mod}=\frac{\hbar\kappa}{2\pi}\left(1+\frac{S}{C}\right), \end{equation*} establishing a universal link between finite-capacity thermodynamics and nonextensive entropy. We further obtain a corrected scalar Einstein equation with an upper bound on horizon energy flux, pointing to testable signatures in heavy-ion collisions, accelerator spin polarization, and analog gravity experiments. These results reinforce the robustness of the emergent-gravity paradigm and connect spacetime dynamics to generalized entropies of quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>On Charge Conjugation, Correlations, Elitzur's Theorem and the Mass Gap Problem in Lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills Models in $d=4$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional Euclidean Wilson lattice Yang-Mills model with gauge group $SU(N)$, and the associated lattice Euclidean quantum field theory constructed by Osterwalder-Schrader-Seiler via a Feynman-Kac formula. In this model, to each lattice bond $b$ there is assigned a bond variable $U_b\in SU(N)$. Gluon fields are parameters in the Lie algebra of $SU(N)$. We define a charge conjugation operator $\mathcal C$ in the physical Hilbert space $H$ and prove that, for $N\not=2$, $H$ admits an orthogonal decomposition into two sectors with charge conjugation $\pm1$. There is only one sector for $N=2$. In the space of correlations, a charge conjugation operator $C_E$ is defined and a similar decomposition holds. Besides, a version of Elitzur's theorem is shown; applications are given. It is proven that the expectation averages of two distinct lattice vector potential correlators is zero. Surprisingly, the expectation of two distinct field strength tensors is also zero. In the gluon field parametrization it is known that Wilson action is bounded quadratically in the gluon fields. Towards solving the mass gap problem, in the gluon field expansion of the action, we show there are no local terms, such as a mass term. However, the action associated with the exponent of the exponentiated Haar measure density has a positive local mass term which is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling $\beta=g^{-2}&gt;0$ and the $SU(N)$ quadratic Casimir operator eigenvalue. Our results also hold in dimension three. Of course, the orthogonal decomposition of the Hilbert space $H$ has consequences in the analysis of the truncated two-point plaquette field correlation and the Yang-Mills mass gap problem: for $N\not=2$ and at least for small $\beta$, a multiplicity-two one-particle glueball state (two mass gaps) is expected to be present in the energy-momentum spectrum of the Yang-Mills model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spherically symmetric black hole solution defined by the gravitational mass is explored in higher-order curvature gravity associated with a scalar field. It is demonstrated that the singularities of the curvature invariants will be far weaker around the central region of the black hole than those in general relativity, owing to the effect originating from higher-order curvatures with the coupling to a dynamical scalar field. Furthermore, thermodynamic properties and the Davies-type phase transition of the black hole are investigated for Barrow entropy with a quantum effect of gravitation. It is found that both the quasi-local energy and Gibbs free energy are positive, and the black hole can hence be stable on the smooth horizon surface. In addition, by analyzing the geodesic deviation, the stability conditions of the black hole are explicitly shown.</description>

Abstract: The energy density generated by a vector current is characterized by a single parameter $a_{\mathcal{E}}$ bounded by unitarity to $-1/2 \leq a_{\mathcal{E}} \leq 1$, with extremal values saturated by free theories of different matter content. Through confinement, QCD transmutes fermionic matter into scalars, revealing a nontrivial flow between extremal correlators. We reconstruct this flow using perturbative QCD and chiral perturbation theory. The observable is accessible with currently available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dark tranquility: Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. However, the behavior of wave propagation in such extreme habitats remains rich and nuanced. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that persist without ever reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Competing Dirac masses in one dimension: Symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition and deconfined criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent symmetries and slow crossover phenomena are central themes in quantum criticality and manifest themselves in the pseudocritical scaling experienced in the context of deconfined criticality. Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\omega_0 \to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Saturation of Chaos Bound in a Phenomenological Rotating Black Hole--Effective Matter System at Low-Temperature Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chaotic behavior of a phenomenological system of rotating black holes (BHs) surrounded by radiation, dust, and dark matter as effective matter fluids. We show that the chaos bound is saturated -- but never violated -- when the density parameter $k \rightarrow 1$, which corresponds to a high dark matter concentration in the halo. This saturation is independent of radiation and dust density, occurring in the low-temperature regime where the BH's surface gravity and Hawking temperature decrease. Our results suggest that rotating BHs subjected to a phenomenological representation of a more realistic matter environment can scramble information as efficiently as allowed by physical laws in this limit. This work links quantum chaos research with phenomenological BH-matter configurations, providing a motivation for studies of chaos in astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newton's law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are utterly negligible when considering the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop-induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newton's law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa-type deviations and inverse-square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth-force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and future experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. Our results provide a model-independent framework for confronting dark-sector scenarios with precision gravity data, and highlight the complementarity of particle physics and short-distance gravitational tests in probing new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and links: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the recent developments of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and links: $\hat{Z}$ and $F_L$. They are $q$-series invariants originated from mathematical physics. They exhibit rich features, for example, quantum modularity, infinite dimensional Verma module structures and knot-quiver correspondence. Furthermore, they have connections to other topological invariants. We also provide a review of an extension of the above series invariants to Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Observational challenges to holographic and Ricci dark energy paradigms: Insights from ACT DR6 and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w&gt;-1$ at early times to $w&lt;-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w&gt;-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.</description>

      <title>Two-flavor chirally imbalanced quark matter beyond large-$N_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a chirally imbalanced medium in the context of the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model using both the large-$N_c$ (LN) and beyond large-$N_c$ (BLN) approximations. To incorporate BLN effects, we consider the optimized perturbation theory (OPT) to the first nontrivial order, which includes two-loop (exchange) contributions. This procedure allows us to explicitly explore how finite $N_c$ corrections affect the thermodynamics as well as the phase diagram of chirally imbalanced quark matter. We then compare the results obtained with a sharp three-dimensional cutoff -- generically referred to as the traditional regularization scheme (TRS) -- and with an alternative procedure called the medium separation scheme (MSS). In the first case, we observe that the pseudocritical temperature decreases as the chiral chemical potential increases, an effect dubbed inverse chiral catalysis (ICC). On the other hand, when considering the MSS regularization, which properly isolates the medium contributions from the vacuum, we find the opposite result. We show that the results obtained with MSS are consistent with well-established LQCD data in both the LN and BLN approximations. Finally, we suggest that to cope with the high-density limit, the standard OPT interpolation prescription must be modified with the inclusion of an extra variational parameter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the first-order QCD phase transition in dense strong interaction matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the phase structure and thermodynamics of QCD in the low temperature and high density region, where a strong, first-order phase transition is expected beyond the critical end point. By solving the quark gap equation in the continuum QCD approach, we reveal the coexistence of the multi-phases both in the microscopic dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking and also in the thermodynamic observables, which suggests the existence of spinodal decomposition during the first-order QCD phase transitions. We also analyse the interface structure of the co-exist Nambu and Wigner phases in the isothermal process during the first-order transition. In particular, the interface tension and interface entropy density are extracted from the isothermal trajectories, which further allows for an analysis on the formation of nuclear bubble, including the bubble radius and its stability at different temperatures. Our predictions may serve as useful inputs for further investigations in heavy-ion physics or astrophysics research.</description>

      <title>Lee--Yang edge singularities in Nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD phase diagram and the associated Lee--Yang edge singularities using the two-flavor nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model extended to complex chemical potential. There exists a strong correlation between the chiral phase transition and the structure of the effective potential in the complex order parameter plane, serving as a criterion to differentiate crossover from first-order transitions. Typically, the Lee--Yang edge singularities can be understood as a generalization of the critical end-point (CEP) between crossover and first-order transitions, where the positive Nambu phase and the Wigner phase coalesce. We further analyze the scaling behavior near the CEP by extracting the critical exponent associated with the Lee--Yang singularities. Additionally, we confirm that the extrapolation of the Lee--Yang edge singularity trajectories provides an effective method of determining the CEP location, even at a small real chemical potential. This provides a viable method for exploring regions of the QCD phase diagram that remain inaccessible to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>The role of the soft scale for $J/\psi$ production in the transverse momentum dependent framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use vNRQCD to study power corrections in the ${\rm v}$ expansion due to soft gluon radiation during $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum. We categorize four new $J/\psi$ production operators that mediate the transition of perturbatively produced color-octet charm quark/anti-quark pairs to charm quarks in a $^3S_1^{[1]}$ state via soft gluon emission. We then use Soft Collinear Effective Theory and vNRQCD to derive a factorization theorem for $J/\psi$ production in SIDIS in terms of the gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs in the proton and new objects which we call TMD soft transition functions. We show that the TMD soft transition function leads in the ${\rm v}$ power-counting with respect to the color-octet TMD shape functions that have been used in previous studies of $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the Black Hole Interior Volume and Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent investigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper entitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole interior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior volume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a space-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$. Using this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is proportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this formulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of infalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the charged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical analysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the volume linearly increases with advancing time.
  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black hole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black hole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality constant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy is less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note that these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than the Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand the uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>A novel force from the curved field space: Lepton flavor violation and $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the nonzero curvature extension of the field space for the charged leptons induces a peculiar force, leading to an elegant and simple mechanism for generating the charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV) and their anomalous magnetic moment, which has not been explored in the literature. This novel force corrects the electromagnetic vertex, leading to an effective coupling which is flavor off-diagonal at tree level. Consequently, it yields the CLFV decays with a very strongly amplified sensitivity, allowing for the CLFV probes in the small flavor-violating parameter region which is out of reach of the previous models. We point out a new type of contribution for the anomalous magnetic moment of the charged leptons, coming from the electric form factor corrected by the force emerging from the curved field space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study entropy production in Deep Inelastic Scattering using Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the dominant contribution to entropy is due to soft gluons. This contribution is usually neglected in standard Monte Carlo approaches, since it does not affect hadronic spectra. However, it is relevant for entropy and multiplicity distributions, as we demonstrate with explicit calculations. We further show that, as one lowers the cutoff - i.e. includes soft gluons - thereby making the Monte Carlo parton distributions closer to inclusive PDFs, the resulting entropy is very close to that measured by the H1 collaboration, without the need to account for hadronization effects. This provides further evidence that the bulk of the measured entropy originates from initial-state effects.</description>

      <title>Wigner function of a rigidly rotating and magnetized QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Wigner function of a rigidly rotating quantum electrodynamics (QED) plasma in the presence of a constant magnetic field by utilizing the Riemannian normal coordinate approximation, which has been previously proposed in the literature. In this approach, the angular velocity appears only in a specific phase factor, allowing us to compute the point-split fermion two-point correlation function in flat spacetime. To ensure that the fermion correlation function is gauge invariant, we introduce a background gauge field that is fixed to produce a constant magnetic field. Using this Wigner function, we derive the energy-momentum tensor for this medium, which consists of both diagonal and off-diagonal components. By comparing our results with the energy-momentum tensor of an ideal spinful and vortical magnetized fluid, we establish a connection between these components and thermodynamic quantities, such as energy density and different types of pressure. We demonstrate that rigid rotation leads to pressure anisotropy in plasma. Additionally, we compute the associated vector and axial vector currents for this medium, utilizing the previously presented Wigner function. Our results are consistent with existing literature on the subject.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used us to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the bipartite and multipartite quantum entanglement structure in gravity and the dual holographic field theory based on the generalized Rindler wedge formalism. We deduce a separation theorem, which asserts that for subregions satisfying a certain geometric condition, the bipartite/multipartite squashed entanglement or the conditional entanglement of multipartite information vanishes, indicating that these subregions represent separable states with no quantum entanglement among them. We interpret this fact from the observer perspective in gravity and show how to probe the entanglement structure further in this framework by introducing a time cutoff in the gravitational spacetime. We also present the corresponding dual boundary field theory interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Investigation of neutrino spin oscillation in the gravitational fields of black holes (BHs) is one of the interesting topics in neutrino physics. On the other hand, in recent years, many studies have been devoted to the exploration of different physical phenomena in higher dimensions. Non-commutative geometry has also been focus of researchers in recent years to explore the structure of space-time more deeply and accurately. In this work, the neutrino spin oscillation in the non-commutative higher dimensional gravitational fields of Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstrom metrics is studied. The effects of noncommutativity of space are calculated and its role in different dimensions is discussed. Considering the fact that in the non-commutative space, for certain values of eta, no event horizon exists and consequently, there will be no BH, some upper bounds for the non-commutative parameter are obtained.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Topological Field Theories and Nahm Sum Formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a large class of characters of 2d conformal field theories (CFTs) can be written in the form of a Nahm sum. In \cite{Zagier:2007knq}, D. Zagier identified a list of Nahm sum expressions that are modular functions under a congruence subgroup of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be thought of as candidates for characters of rational CFTs. Motivated by the observation that the same formulas appear as the half-indices of certain 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories, we perform a general search over low-rank 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theories which either flow to unitary TFTs or $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-zero SCFTs in the infrared. These are exceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and $C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our results with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Transdimensional Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>Structure of Carrollian (conformal) superalgebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible supersymmetric extensions of the Carrollian algebra and the Carrollian conformal algebra in both $d=4$ and $d=3$. For the super-Carrollian algebra in $d=4$, we identify multiple admissible structures, depending on the representations of the supercharges with respect to the Carrollian rotation. Some of these structures can be derived by taking the speed of light $c\to 0$ limit from super-Poincar\'e algebra, but others are completely novel. In the conformal case, we demonstrate that the nontrivial Carrollian superconformal algebras for $d=4$ and $d=3$ are isomorphic to super-Poincar\'e algebra of $d=5$ and $d=4$ respectively. Remarkably, neither of these constructions requires R-symmetry to ensure the algebraic closure. Furthermore, we discover two distinct classes of super-BMS$_4$ algebras, i.e. one singlet super-BMS$_4$ algebra and two multiplet chiral super-BMS$_4$ algebras. The singlet case arises from extending the $3$D Carrollian superconformal algebra, whereas the multiplet cases do not admit this pathology due to their finite-dimensional subalgebra containing supercharges with conformal dimension $\Delta=\pm\frac{3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Global variants of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theories and Calogero-Moser systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global variants of four-dimensional gauge theories are specified by their spectrum of genuine Wilson-'t Hooft line operators. The choice of global variant has significant consequences when spacetime is taken to be $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$. We focus on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories, which are closely connected to twisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems. We establish, on general grounds, how this gauge-theoretic topological data manifests itself on the integrable system side by introducing a notion of global variants for complex many-body integrable systems associated with Lie algebras. Focusing on $\mathcal N=1^*$ theories of type $A$ and $B_2$, we elucidate the implications for the structure of gapped vacua, the emergent (generalized) symmetries realized in each vacuum, and the action of spontaneously broken modular invariance.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement in AdS$_{3}$ Vaidya</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the studies of pseudo-entropy in de Sitter, there have been recent proposals for a timelike entanglement in AdS/CFT. In this work, we explore this proposal in the context of a holographic CFT undergoing a global quench. We study various cases in which the timelike intervals are anchored at various boundary times, sometimes straddling the infalling shell. The early and late time behaviours reproduce the known results coming from the pure AdS and the black hole geometry dual to the thermal CFT state respectively. However when the infalling shock straddles the timelike interval, the dynamics drastically differs from how the entanglement entropy evolves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a manifestly duality-invariant, Lorentz-invariant, and local action to describe quantum electrodynamics theory in the presence of magnetic monopoles that derives from Sen's formalism. By employing field strengths as the dynamical variables, rather than potentials, this formalism resolves longstanding ambiguities in prior frameworks. Our analysis finds consistent outcomes at both tree and loop levels using the established principles of quantum field theory, obviating the need for external assumptions or amendments. We clarify the mechanisms of charge renormalisation and demonstrate the renormalisation group invariance of the charge quantisation condition. Our approach can be useful for phenomenological studies and in quantum field theories with strong-weak dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibre inflationary models are constructed in type-IIB string flux compactification. These models have been shown to be in agreement with the cosmological observations under appropriate choices of parameters, which originate from their string theory construction. In the present work, we embed such models, originally studied in the cold inflation picture, in the context of warm inflation. We study the viability of different fibre inflation potentials in both strong and weak dissipative regime of warm inflation. In fibre inflation, the inflaton is a four-dimensional complex manifold -- a fibre of a $K3$ fibred Calabi-Yau. The potential in this case is generated by an interplay of various perturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The former type of corrections consists of leading-order $\alpha'^3-$ term, higher derivative $F^4-$ correction, and various string loop corrections of KK, log-loop and winding type. Depending on the balance between several corrections, we present four different fibre inflationary potentials and show that the warm inflationary pictures for all of them can successfully fall in the viable window from both Planck and recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. We show that warm inflation makes it possible to extend the range of parameters of applicability of these models. Our results also indicate that with the help of a large dissipation ratio, one can achieve a sub-Planckian field excursion, although, this runs on the possibility of moving away from the perturbative control of low-energy four-dimensional supergravity theory.</description>

Abstract: We investigated the Goon-Penco(GP) relationship in (n+1)-dimensional black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant. Our analysis revealed that the GP relation preserved its form in four-dimensional and (n+1)-dimensional spacetimes, demonstrating its universal behavior with respect to dimensionality. Furthermore, we established that the GP relation exhibits universality across all states of the black hole, including those associated with the event horizon and the cosmological horizon. These findings confirm that the GP relationship remains valid for (n+1)-dimensional black holes and black branes with an arbitrary cosmological constant, independent of the coordinate system employed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>A generalized statistical model for fits to parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) form an essential part of particle physics calculations. Currently, the most precise predictions for these non-perturbative functions are generated through fits to global data. A problem that several PDF fitting groups encounter is the presence of tension in data sets that appear to pull the fits in different directions. In other words, the best fit depends on the choice of data set. Several methods to capture the uncertainty in PDFs in presence of seemingly inconsistent fits have been proposed and are currently in use. These methods are important to ensure that uncertainty in PDFs are not underestimated. Here we propose a novel method for estimating the uncertainty by introducing a generalized statistical model based on Bayesian Hierarchical models which is implemented via the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The methodology is inspired by unsupervised machine learning techniques and is closely related to the statistical methods of Ensemble learning and Bayesian model averaging. Using a toy model of PDFs, we demonstrate how the GMM can be used to faithfully reconstruct the likelihood associated with PDF fits, which can in turn be used to accurately determine the uncertainty on PDFs, especially in the presence of tension in the fitted data sets. We further show how this statistical model reduces to the usual chi-squared likelihood function for a consistent data set and provide measures to optimize the number of Gaussians in the GMM.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Axion-like Curvaton: Non-Gaussianity and Primordial Black Holes Without Large Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a mechanism of primordial black hole (PBH) formation that does not require specific features in the inflationary potential, revisiting previous literature. In this mechanism, a light spectator field evolves stochastically during inflation and remains subdominant during the post-inflationary era. Even though the curvature power spectrum stays small at all scales, rare perturbations of the field probe a local maximum in its potential, leading to non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of curvature fluctuations, and to copious PBH production. For a concrete axion-like particle (ALP) scenario we analytically determine the distribution of the compaction function for perturbations, showing that it is characterized by a heavy tail, which produces an extended PBH mass distribution. We find the ALP mass and decay constant to be correlated with the PBH mass, for instance, an ALP with a mass $m_a = 5.4 \times 10^{14}$ eV and a decay constant $f_a = 4.6 \times 10^{-5} Mpl$ can lead to PBHs of mass $M_{\rm PBH} = 10^{21}$ g as the entire dark matter (DM) of the universe, and is testable in future PBH observations via lensing in the NGRST and mergers detectable in the LISA and ET Gravitational Waves (GW) detectors. We then extend our analysis to mixed ALP and PBH dark matter and Higgs-like spectator fields. We find that PBHs cluster strongly over all cosmological scales, clashing with CMB isocurvature bounds. We argue that this problem is shared by all PBH production from inflationary models that depend solely on large non-Gaussianity without a peak in the curvature power spectrum and discuss possible remedies.</description>

Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Gravities and Equivalence Principle: Foundations and experimental implications</title>

Abstract: The so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity includes General Relativity (GR), based on spacetime curvature; the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), which relies on spacetime torsion; and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (STEGR), grounded in nonmetricity. Recent studies demonstrate that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are dynamically equivalent, raising questions about the fundamental structure of spacetime, the under-determination of these theories, and whether empirical distinctions among them are possible. The aim of this work is to show that they are equivalent in many features but not exactly in everything. In particular, their relationship with the Equivalence Principle (EP) is different. The EP is a deeply theory-laden assumption, which is assumed as fundamental in constructing GR, with significant implications for our understanding of spacetime. However, it introduces unresolved conceptual issues, including its impact on the nature of the metric and connection, its meaning at the quantum level, tensions with other fundamental interactions and new physics, and its role in dark matter and dark energy problems. In contrast, TEGR and STEGR recover the EP, in particular in its strong formulation, but do not rely on it as a foundational principle. The fact that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are equivalent in non-trivial predictions, but the EP is not necessary for TEGR and STEGR, suggests that it may not be a fundamental feature but an emergent one, potentially marking differences in the empirical content of the three theories. Thus, the developments within the Geometric Trinity framework challenge traditional assumptions about spacetime and may help to better understand some of the unresolved foundational difficulties related to the EP.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic grand unification in SO(10) with one extra dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification provides an alternative approach to gradually unify gauge couplings in the UV limit, where they reach a non-trivial UV fixed point. Using an economical and realistic particle content setup, we demonstrate that asymptotic grand unification can be achieved in a 5D SO(10) model with one extra dimension. The top, bottom and tau masses are split, and the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained via inverse seesaw. One intermediate scale, the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale, is included below the compactification scale. Due to the absence of large-dimensional Higgs representations, gauge couplings exhibit asymptotic safety and are thus asymptotically unified, regardless of their initial values. In contrast, Yukawa couplings can achieve asymptotic freedom if the negative gauge contributions dominate over the positive Yukawa terms, requiring exact unification at the compactification scale. The widely-used 126-dimensional Higgs is not recommended in this 5D asymptotic SO(10) GUT, as it tends to drive the gauge beta function positive, compromising asymptotic safety.</description>

      <title>Behaviour of $\alpha$-attractors in Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation have remained one of the preferred inflationary models for nearly a decade now. The unique attractor nature of these models in the $n_s-r$ plane have put these models in the sweet-spot of the $n_s-r$ measurement of Planck observations. In this article, we analyse the behaviour of such attractor models in a Warm Inflation setup to investigate whether the attractor nature of these models can be retained even when the dynamics deviates from the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. We have chosen to analyse these models in a strongly dissipative Warm inflation setup, namely the Minimal Warm Inflation, as in such a setup the inflationary dynamics significantly departs from the standard Cold inflation dynamics. We observe that the departure from the standard Cold inflation dynamics destroys the unique attractor nature of such models. The analysis clearly indicates that the attractor nature of these $\alpha$-attractor models is quite unique to the standard Cold inflationary dynamics. However, on a positive note, the analysis indicates that the $\alpha$-attractor models may be made in tune with the recent ACT results in Warm inflation for certain parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Hair imprints of the gravitational decoupling and hairy black hole spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hairy black holes by gravitational decoupling (GD) are probed to derive the gravitational waveform produced by perturbation theory applied to these compact objects. Using the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations governing the metric perturbations and applying a higher-order WKB method, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed and discussed. Compared to the QNMs produced in the ringdown phase of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole solutions, it yields a clear physical signature of primary hair imprinting the hairy GD black hole gravitational waveforms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Electron EDM in the NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with explicit CP violation offers a promising framework for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry while remaining consistent with stringent electric dipole moment (EDM) bounds. In this work, we identify a previously overlooked set of two-loop diagrams that contribute to fermion EDMs in the NMSSM. Our analysis of the electron EDM shows that, for certain NMSSM specific CP-violating phases, these diagrams partially cancel existing contributions, thereby relaxing the associated constraints. In other phases, the diagrams dominate and tighten the bounds, which in turn necessitates more finely tuned parameters to reconcile successful baryogenesis with current EDM limits.</description>
