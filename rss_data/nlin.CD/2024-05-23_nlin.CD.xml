      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the confidence region in orbit determination for hyperbolic maps with a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dealing with an orbit determination problem, uncertainties naturally arise from intrinsic errors related to observation devices and approximation models. Following the least squares method and applying approximation schemes such as the differential correction, uncertainties can be geometrically summarized in confidence regions and estimated by confidence ellipsoids. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the confidence ellipsoids while the number of observations and the time span over which they are performed simultaneously increase. Numerical evidences suggest that, in the chaotic scenario, the uncertainties decay at different rates whether the orbit determination is set up to recover the initial conditions alone or along with a dynamical or kinematical parameter, while in the regular case there is no distinction. We show how to improve some of the results in \cite{maro.bonanno}, providing conditions that imply a non-faster-than-polynomial rate of decay in the chaotic case with the parameter, in accordance with the numerical experiments. We also apply these findings to well known examples of chaotic maps, such as piecewise expanding maps of the unit interval or affine hyperbolic toral transformations. We also discuss the applicability to intermittent maps.</description>

      <title>Numerical spectral analysis of standing waves in quantum hydrodynamics with viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the linearization around standing wave profiles for two quantum hydrodynamics systems with linear and nonlinear viscosity. The essential spectrum for such profiles is stable; we investigate the point spectrum using an Evans function technique. For both systems we show numerically that there exists a real unstable eigenvalue, thus providing numerical evidence for spectral instability.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to chaos in a canonical random neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a paradigmatic random recurrent neural network introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS). In the infinite size limit, this system exhibits a direct transition from a homogeneous rest state to chaotic behavior, with the Lyapunov exponent gradually increasing from zero. We generalize the SCS model considering odd saturating nonlinear transfer functions, beyond the usual choice $\phi(x)=\tanh x$. A discontinuous transition to chaos occurs whenever the slope of $\phi$ at 0 is a local minimum (i.e.,~for $\phi'''(0)&gt;0$). Chaos appears out of the blue, by an attractor-repeller fold. Accordingly, the Lyapunov exponent stays away from zero at the birth of chaos.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a state-of-the-art weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, in a narrow region, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics in chaotic quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an ensemble of two-dimensional nonintegrable quantum circuits that are chaotic but have a conserved particle current, and thus a finite Drude weight. The long-wavelength hydrodynamics of such systems is given by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By analyzing circuit-to-circuit fluctuations in the ensemble we argue that these are negligible, so the circuit-averaged value of transport coefficients like the viscosity is also (in the long-time limit) the value in a typical circuit. The circuit-averaged transport coefficients can be mapped onto a classical irreversible Markov process. Therefore, remarkably, our construction allows us to efficiently compute the viscosity of a family of strongly interacting chaotic two-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Melancholia States of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a much studied component of the climate system, because its suspected multistability leads to tipping behaviour with large regional and global climatic impacts. In this paper we investigate the global stability properties of the system using an ocean general circulation model. We construct an unstable AMOC state, i.e., an unstable solution of the flow that resides between the stable regimes of a vigorous and collapsed AMOC. Such a solution, also known as a Melancholia or edge state, is a dynamical saddle embedded in the boundary separating the competing basins of attraction. It is physically relevant since it lies on the most probable path of a noise-induced transition between the two stable regimes, and because tipping occurs when one of the attractors and the Melancholia state collide. Its properties may thus give hints towards physical mechanisms and predictability of the critical transition. We find that while the AMOC Melancholia state as viewed from its upper ocean properties lies between the vigorous and collapsed regimes, it is characterized by an Atlantic deep ocean that is fresher and colder compared to both stable regimes. The Melancholia state has higher dynamic enthalpy than either stable state, representing a state of higher potential energy that is in good agreement with the dynamical landscape view on metastability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Fully parallel implementation of digital memcomputing on FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully parallel digital memcomputing solver implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) board. For this purpose, we have designed an FPGA code that solves the ordinary differential equations associated with digital memcomputing in parallel. A feature of the code is the use of only integer-type variables and integer constants to enhance optimization. Consequently, each integration step in our solver is executed in 96~ns. This method was utilized for difficult instances of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem close to a phase transition, involving up to about 150 variables. Our results demonstrate that the parallel implementation reduces the scaling exponent by about 1 compared to a sequential C++ code on a standard computer. Additionally, compared to C++ code, we observed a time-to-solution advantage of about three orders of magnitude. Given the limitations of FPGA resources, the current implementation of digital memcomputing will be especially useful for solving compact but challenging problems.</description>

      <title>Global Behavior of Learning Dynamics in Zero-Sum Games with Memory Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the global behavior of dynamics in learning in games between two players, X and Y. We consider the simplest situation for memory asymmetry between two players: X memorizes the other Y's previous action and uses reactive strategies, while Y has no memory. Although this memory complicates the learning dynamics, we discover two novel quantities that characterize the global behavior of such complex dynamics. One is an extended Kullback-Leibler divergence from the Nash equilibrium, a well-known conserved quantity from previous studies. The other is a family of Lyapunov functions of X's reactive strategy. These two quantities capture the global behavior in which X's strategy becomes more exploitative, and the exploited Y's strategy converges to the Nash equilibrium. Indeed, we theoretically prove that Y's strategy globally converges to the Nash equilibrium in the simplest game equipped with an equilibrium in the interior of strategy spaces. Furthermore, our experiments also suggest that this global convergence is universal for more advanced zero-sum games than the simplest game. This study provides a novel characterization of the global behavior of learning in games through a couple of indicators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as a {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators in Kicked Coupled Tops: Information Scrambling in Mixed Phase Space and the Role of Conserved Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study operator growth in a bipartite kicked coupled tops (KCT) system using out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs), which quantify ``information scrambling" due to chaotic dynamics and serve as a quantum analog of classical Lyapunov exponents. In the KCT system, chaos arises from the hyper-fine coupling between the spins. Due to a conservation law, the system's dynamics decompose into distinct invariant subspaces. Focusing initially on the largest subspace, we numerically verify that the OTOC growth rate aligns well with the classical Lyapunov exponent for fully chaotic dynamics. While previous studies have largely focused on scrambling in fully chaotic dynamics, works on mixed-phase space scrambling are sparse. We explore scrambling behavior in both mixed-phase space and globally chaotic dynamics. In the mixed phase space, we use Percival's conjecture to partition the eigenstates of the Floquet map into ``regular" and ``chaotic." Using these states as the initial states, we examine how their mean phase space locations affect the growth and saturation of the OTOCs. Beyond the largest subspace, we study the OTOCs across the entire system, including all other smaller subspaces. For certain initial operators, we analytically derive the OTOC saturation using random matrix theory (RMT). When the initial operators are chosen randomly from the unitarily invariant random matrix ensembles, the averaged OTOC relates to the linear entanglement entropy of the Floquet operator, as found in earlier works. For the diagonal Gaussian initial operators, we provide a simple expression for the OTOC.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties and mechanisms of metastability: a perspective in neuroscience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastability, characterized by a variability of regimes in time, is a ubiquitous type of neural dynamics. It has been formulated in many different ways in the neuroscience literature, however, which may cause some confusion. In this Perspective, we discuss metastability from the point of view of dynamical systems theory. We extract from the literature a very simple but general definition through the concept of metastable regimes as long-lived but transient epochs of activity with unique dynamical properties. This definition serves as an umbrella term that encompasses formulations from other works, and readily connects to concepts from dynamical systems theory. This allows us to examine general dynamical properties of metastable regimes, propose in a didactic manner several dynamics-based mechanisms that generate them, and discuss a theoretical tool to characterize them quantitatively. This perspective leads to insights that help to address issues debated in the literature and also suggest pathways for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the intermittent properties of a shell model of turbulence with unprecedented statistics, about $\sim 10^7$ eddy turn over time, achieved thanks to an implementation on a large-scale parallel GPU factory. This allows us to quantify the inertial range anomalous scaling properties of the velocity fluctuations up to the 24th order moment. Through a careful assessment of the statistical and systematic uncertainties, we show that none of the phenomenological and theoretical models previously proposed in the literature to predict the anomalous power-law exponents in the inertial range is in agreement with our high-precision numerical measurements. We find that at asymptotically high order moments, the anomalous exponents tend towards a linear scaling, suggesting that extreme turbulent events are dominated by one leading singularity. We found that systematic corrections to scaling induced by the infrared and ultraviolet (viscous) cut-offs are the main limitations to precision for low-order moments, while high orders are mainly affected by the finite statistical samples. The unprecedentedly high fidelity numerical results reported in this work offer an ideal benchmark for the development of future theoretical models of intermittency in dynamical systems for either extreme events (high-order moments) or typical fluctuations (low-order moments). For the latter, we show that we achieve a precision in the determination of the inertial range scaling exponents of the order of one part over ten thousand (5th significant digit), which must be considered a record for out-of-equilibrium fluid-mechanics systems and models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the Rosenzweig Porter model for all symmetry classes of the Dyson threefold way. We analyzed the fluctuation properties in the eigenvalue spectra, and compared them with existing and new analytical results. Based on these results we propose characteristics of the spectral properties as measures to explore the transition from Poisson to Wigner Dyson WD statistics. Furthermore, we performed thorough studies of the properties of the eigenvectors in terms of the fractal dimensions, the Kullback Leibler KL divergences and the fidelity susceptibility. The ergodic and Anderson transitions take place at the same parameter values and a finite size scaling analysis of the KL divergences at the transitions yields the same critical exponents for all three WD classes, thus indicating superuniversality of these transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the prediction of subsequent steps in H\'enon Map using various machine learning techniques. The H\'enon map, well known for its chaotic behaviour, finds applications in various fields including cryptography, image encryption, and pattern recognition. Machine learning methods, particularly deep learning, are increasingly essential for understanding and predicting chaotic phenomena. This study evaluates the performance of different machine learning models including Random Forest, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN) in predicting the evolution of the H\'enon map. Results indicate that LSTM network demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, particularly in extreme event prediction. Furthermore, a comparison between LSTM and FNN models reveals the LSTM's advantage, especially for longer prediction horizons and larger datasets. This research underscores the significance of machine learning in elucidating chaotic dynamics and highlights the importance of model selection and dataset size in forecasting subsequent steps in chaotic systems.</description>
