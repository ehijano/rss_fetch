      <title>On the Riemann-Finsler Geometry of Tangent Bundle of Lie Groups with Two-Dimensional Commutator Subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin by studying the Riemannian geometry of the tangent Lie group $TG$ associated with a Lie group $G$ whose commutator subgroup is two-dimensional, equipped with the lift of a left-invariant Riemannian metric on $G$. We establish the relationship between the sectional curvatures of $G$ and those of $TG$. Next, we define a Randers metric on $G$ from a left-invariant Riemannian metric and a left-invariant vector field, and lift it vertically and completely to $TG$. We investigate the conditions under which this Randers metric is of Berwald and Douglas type, respectively, and compute the flag curvatures in the Berwald case. In an addendum, we discuss geodesic vectors and bi-invariant Riemannian metrics on these Lie groups, highlighting the special unimodularity conditions. Finally, we provide explicit formulas for the Riemannian curvature tensor on the tangent bundle of such a Lie group.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Structures on Lie Groups with Two-dimensional Commutator Subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies left-invariant Hermitian structures on Lie groups with two-dimensional commutator subgroups. We provide an explicit classification for two specific types of such structures, which we designate as Type I and Type II. Furthermore, we classify the Kahler structures within these two types and compute their associated Bismut connections. Finally, we present examples of Kahler and strong (respectively, weak) Kahler with torsion structures.</description>

      <title>Integral Curves and Flows on Banach Manifolds in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalisation of the existence and uniqueness theorems of integral curves of vector fields on Banach manifolds in the Lean theorem prover. First, we formalize properties of differential equations on Banach spaces (the Picard-Lindel\"of theorem, the Gr\"onwall inequality, and corollaries), and then transfer results to abstract Banach manifolds. Built upon the differential and integral calculus and Banach manifolds libraries in Mathlib, our work aims to lay the foundation for dynamical systems and differential geometry libraries that are general, robust, and friendly to classical mathematicians.</description>

      <title>Dolbeault formality for complex nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-isomorphism of differential graded algebras (DGA) is a multiplicative map inducing an isomorphism on cohomology. A DGA is called formal if it can be connected by a chain of quasi-isomorphisms to its cohomology algebra. We prove that the Dolbeault DGA of a complex nilmanifold is formal only if it is a torus, and the Dolbeault algebra of (0,p)-forms is formal if and only if the complex structure is abelian.</description>

      <title>Connections, metrics and Higgs fields on complex fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a representation of the extension class associated to a holomorphic fibration by curvature, generalizing the work of Atiyah on holomorphic principal bundles in a natural way. As an application, we obtain a nonlinear analogue of the classical result of Weil on characterizing the existence of flat connections on holomorphic vector bundles over compact Riemann surfaces. We further establish a faithful functor from the category of nonlinear flat bundles reductive of K\"ahler type to the category of nonlinear Higgs bundles over the same base, which is assumed to be a compact complex manifold of K\"ahler type. Finally, we establish a notion of nonlinear harmonic bundle and prove that the variation of nonabelian Hodge structure is a nonlinear harmonic bundle in the rank one case and in the semisimple case.</description>

      <title>The moduli spaces of presymplectic forms on almost abelian Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions to determine the existence of presymplectic forms of a given rank on all almost abelian Lie algebras. We also study the moduli space of presymplectic forms (this is the set of all closed 2-forms of a given rank under a certain natural equivalence relation) on almost abelian Lie algebras. Most importantly we show that for any almost abelian Lie algebra its moduli space of symplectic forms is finite. Moreover we show that up to such natural equivalence all symplectic forms are permutations of a canonical 2-form. The important step in the proof is obtaining canonical representatives for a certain congruence of matrices, which is of some interest for matrix theory on its own.</description>

      <title>Subdifferential theory and the Fenchel conjugate via Busemann functions on Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a notion of subdifferential defined via Busemann functions and use it to identify a condition under which the Fenchel-Young inequality of Bento, Cruz Neto and Melo (Appl. Math. Optim. 88:83, 2023) holds with equality. This equality condition is particularly significant, as it captures a fundamental duality principle in convex analysis, linking a primal convex function to its conjugate and clarifying the sharpness of the associated inequality on Riemannian manifolds. We also investigate the existence of non-trivial affine functions under Ricci curvature information. In particular, we extend the result of Bento, Cruz Neto and Melo, originally formulated for the case of negative Ricci curvature on an open set, to manifolds whose Ricci curvature may be non-zero. As a consequence, we prove new non-existence criteria for non-trivial affine functions and show that the assumption of non-zero Ricci curvature is, in general, necessary to ensure such a rigidity conclusion.</description>

      <title>Poisson geometry of truncated polynomials and hypersurface algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symplectic forms on hypersurface algebroids. These are a broad generalization of the $b^{k}$-Poisson structures studied extensively by Miranda, Scott, and collaborators, and their geometry is intimately related to the group of truncated polynomials under composition. They induce Poisson structures that are generically symplectic and drop rank along a codimension $1$ submanifold $W$. However, unlike in the case of $b^{k}$-Poisson structures, the symplectic foliation along $W$ can have non-zero symplectic variation, reflecting the obstruction to extending the order of vanishing of a hypersurface algebroid. In addition to studying the symplectic geometry of these algebroids, in this paper we carry out a detailed study of the Lie algebroid de Rham complex, and develop a method for deforming symplectic forms along paths in a $k$-jet character variety. As a result, we are able to produce a large class of new examples of Poisson structures. Finally, we construct universal hypersurface algebroids and show that in even dimensions they admit canonical Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Gel'fand's inverse problem under Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Gel'fand's inverse problem asks whether a Riemannian manifold is uniquely determined by the knowledge of the heat kernel on any open subset of the manifold. We study this inverse problem in the non-smooth setting in the framework of ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ spaces, namely, metric-measure spaces with synthetic Riemannian Ricci curvature bounded below by $K$ and dimension bounded above by $N$. We establish the unique solvability of Gel'fand's inverse problem for the class of compact ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ spaces whose regular set admits $C^1$-Riemannian structure. As an application, we obtain the stability of Gel'fand's inverse problem in the class of closed Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature, diameter and volume bounded from below. We note that the results are new even for Einstein orbifolds and (weighted) Riemannian manifolds with non-smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We parametrize pp-wave spacetimes with compact codimension 2 hypersurfaces. In the vacuum case, we show that these spacetimes are locally in one-to-one correspondence with smooth curves of Riemannian Ricci-flat metrics modulo smooth curves of diffeomorphisms. We also prove that this one-to-one correspondence extends to pp-waves with prescribed null Ricci curvature. Moreover, the pp-wave spacetime carries a lightlike parallel spinor if and only if one (and hence all) of the Ricci-flat metrics carries a parallel spinor.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of Complete Spacelike LW-Submanifolds in Locally Symmetric Semi-Riemannian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M^{n}$ be an $n$-dimensional complete spacelike linear Weingarten submanifold immersed in a locally symmetric semi-Riemannian space $\mathbb{L}_{q}^{n+p}$ of index $q$, with parallel normalized mean curvature vector field and flat normal bundle. Assuming that $M^{n}$ satisfies suitable curvature constraints, we investigate rigidity results for such submanifolds. By combining a Simons-type formula for spacelike submanifolds with analytic techniques involving the Cheng-Yau modified operator $\mathcal{L}$, we establish sharp inequalities relating the traceless second fundamental form and the gradient of the mean curvature. As applications, we obtain several characterization results showing that $M^{n}$ must be either totally umbilical or isoparametric. More precisely, we derive rigidity results under three distinct frameworks: via the Omori-Yau maximum principle, via the $\mathcal{L}$-parabolicity of the underlying manifold, and under an integrability condition on the gradient of the mean curvature. These results generalize and unify known classification theorems for spacelike submanifolds satisfying linear Weingarten relations in semi-Riemannian ambient spaces.</description>

      <title>Exact non-stationary solutions of the Euler equations in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop, via Arnold's geometric framework, a mechanism for constructing explicit, smooth, global-in-time, and typically non-stationary solutions of the incompressible Euler equations. The approach introduces a notion of generalized Coriolis force, whose spectrum underlies the construction of these solutions. In the setting of ideal hydrodynamics, the construction recovers classical exact solutions such as Kelvin and Rossby-Haurwitz waves, while also producing new explicit examples on curved surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds including the round three-sphere. We further obtain a complete classification in two dimensions and a partial classification in three dimensions of the Riemannian manifolds that admit such solutions. The method is also formulated in the general Euler-Arnold setting and yields a simple criterion for non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Similarity Algebra: A Framework for Approximate Algebraic and Lie Structures with Collapse to Classical Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical algebraic structures require exact satisfaction of their defining axioms. We propose similarity algebra, a framework extending algebraic and Lie structures to settings where operations satisfy quantitative bounds up to a tolerance $\varepsilon$. Instead of strict associativity, inverses, or distributivity, we study families of operations controlled by explicit $\varepsilon$-estimates and analyze their behavior under limit collapse.
  Under uniform error control and $C^1_{\mathrm{loc}}$ convergence of the structure maps, we prove a general collapse theorem showing that similarity structures converge to classical algebraic objects, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$. We develop a hierarchy of approximate structures, including similarity groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and Lie groups, formalized through axioms satisfied within metric distance $\varepsilon$. We further define a category of similarity algebras governing morphisms between approximate systems. Moreover, we clarify the relationship between similarity algebra and fuzzy algebra, showing that the former generalizes the latter. The proposed similarity algebra can be useful to model real-world phenomena where operations or relations are inherently approximate.</description>

      <title>A Poisson--Poincar\'e--Dulac for Poisson Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Poisson-flat connections with logarithmic poles along a simple normal crossings divisor on a holomorphic Poisson manifold, where flatness is required only along the symplectic foliation. After identifying the relevant logarithmic cotangent Poisson Lie algebroid, we define an Euler--Poisson principal part and a residue theory adapted to the canonical logarithmic Hamiltonian generators. Under a precise nonresonance hypothesis, we establish a Poisson Poincar\'e--Dulac theorem: any logarithmic Poisson-flat connection with prescribed principal part is holomorphically gauge equivalent to a pure Euler--Poisson normal form with constant commuting residues, and this normal form is unique up to Casimir-valued gauge transformations lying in the common centralizer of the residues. To encode both leafwise transport and boundary winding, we construct a twisted leafwise fundamental groupoid via the real oriented blow-up and a 2-pushout that adjoins canonical tangential meridians. In the nonresonant regime, the normal form yields a meridional character determined by the residues, and hence a logarithmic Riemann--Hilbert correspondence in the Poisson setting for this groupoid. Finally, we illustrate the theory with rank-two Poisson modules (Poisson triples) and an explicit family of examples.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Sobolev, Poincar\'e and Beckner Inequalities on Hyperbolic Spaces and Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate several functional and geometric inequalities on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^N$, with a primary emphasis on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, Poincar\'e inequalities, and Beckner-type inequalities, all studied within the framework of the AB program. The main analytical tool employed throughout this paper is symmetrization. More precisely, our approach relies on an improved version of the P\'olya-Szeg\"o inequality on the hyperbolic space, obtained through a careful comparison of the gradient norms of rearranged functions in the hyperbolic and Euclidean settings. For Beckner-type inequalities, we adopt a semigroup approach based on sharp estimates for the heat semigroup, leading to refined interpolation inequalities between Poincar\'e and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Finally, we extend our results beyond hyperbolic space to a class of Riemannian model manifolds $\mathbb{M}^N$ satisfying the centered isoperimetric inequality. This shows that the inequalities and methods developed in this work are robust and rely mainly on geometric and isoperimetric properties, rather than on the specific structure of hyperbolic space itself.</description>

      <title>A synthetic Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Gannon-Lee incompleteness theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes. We assume the synthetic null energy condition of Ketterer and a trappedness condition we call "synthetically asymptotically regular". Our result generalizes this classical result to the weighted case. It also motivates and indicates extensions to low regularity, which are deferred to future work.</description>

      <title>Propagation of regularity along unstable manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi_t : M \to M$ be a flow on a smooth closed connected manifold $M$ that preserves and expands a foliation $F$. We establish a theorem of propagation of regularity along the leaves of $F$ for sections of vector bundles satisfying a transport equation involving the generator of a cocycle over $\varphi_t$. As a consequence, we prove a regularity result for Pollicott-Ruelle resonant states: if such state is smooth in restriction to a piece of an unstable leaf, then it is in fact smooth over the entire manifold. We also announce further applications related to joint integrability of extreme bundles of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms. The proofs rely on a leafwise semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus adapted to a foliated space, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>An Embarrassingly Simple Way to Optimize Orthogonal Matrices at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonality constraints are ubiquitous in robust and probabilistic machine learning. Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours. As such, POGO sets a milestone to finally exploit orthogonality constraints in ML at scale. A PyTorch implementation of POGO is publicly available at https://github.com/adrianjav/pogo.</description>

      <title>$L_\infty$-morphisms between twisted Courant $r$-Lie algebras and untwisted Courant $(r{+}1)$-Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "Lie infinity algebras and higher analogues of Dirac structures and Courant algebroids" [arXiv:1003.1004], Marco Zambon constructs an $L_\infty$-algebra associated with any higher standard or twisted Courant algebroid (also known as a Vinogradov algebroid), and exhibits an explicit $L_\infty$-morphism from the Lie algebra associated with a standard Lie algebroid twisted by a closed 2-form to the Lie-2 algebra of the standard Courant algebroid. He poses the question of whether analogous canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms exist in higher degrees -- namely, for any standard higher Courant algebroid twisted by a closed $(r+1)$-form. We adfirmatively answer this question, presenting a general framework that naturally yields such canonical $L_\infty$-morphisms for arbitrary $r$, while at the same time clarifying the geometrical and homotopical structures underlying the construction. We also show how this framework accommodates the canonical morphism between Roger's observable $L_\infty$-algebra of a pre-$r$-plectic manifold and the higher Courant algebra described by Zambon and one of the authors in "Observables on multisymplectic manifolds and higher Courant algebroids" [arXiv:2209.05836].</description>

      <title>On the behavior of analytic torsion for twisted canonical bundles under degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a degeneration of projective algebraic manifolds equipped with a compact group action over a curve. Suppose that the total space carries a Nakano semi-positive vector bundle, which is equivariant with respect to this action. We consider the relative canonical bundle twisted by this bundle. Under this setting, we prove that the logarithm of the equivariant analytic torsion of the regular fibers for this coefficient admits an asymptotic expansion near the discriminant locus. The leading term is given by a logarithmic singularity, while the subdominant term is given by a loglog-type singularity. In the non-equivariant case, we provide a formula for the coefficient of the leading term in terms of an integral of characteristic classes associated with the semi-stable reduction of the family. To establish these results, we prove the existence of an asymptotic expansion for both the equivariant Quillen metrics and the $L^{2}$-metrics in the above setting. We also calculate the leading term of the fiber integral of the Bott-Chern classes associated with the degeneration.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of almost complex structures on sphere bundles over complex projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of almost complex structures on even-dimensional sphere bundles over complex projective spaces. For bundles $\xi_{n,q}$ with fibre $S^{2q}$ over $\mathbb{C} P^n$, we establish a necessary condition: if $q \ge a(n)$ for an explicit function, then the total space $E_{n,q}$ does not admit an almost complex structure. As an application, we analyse a concrete family associated with the canonical line bundle and obtain non-existence criteria in terms of $p$-adic valuations; for $p=2$ this yields a simple numerical bound. The proofs rely on Chern class computations and divisibility properties of characteristic classes. The results leave open the question of existence in the range $4 \le q &lt; a(n)$.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Gaussian Processes for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to classical computing approaches. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model. We evaluate the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments conducted on a quantum simulator in classical hardware. We use real-world, non-stationary elevation datasets of NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and synthetic datasets generated by Quantum Gaussian Processes. Beyond modeling advantages, our framework highlights potential computational speedups that quantum hardware may provide, particularly in Gaussian processes and distributed optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a number field $F$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{F}$, one can associate to any torsion free subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathcal{O}_{F})$ of finite index a complete Riemannian manifold of finite volume with fibered cusp ends. For natural choices of flat vector bundles on such a manifold, we show that analytic torsion is identified with the Reidemeister torsion of the Borel-Serre compactification. This is used to obtain exponential growth of torsion in the cohomology for sequences of congruence subgroups.</description>

      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Einstein 5-manifolds via 4-dimensional gap theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We refine the regularity of noncollapsed limits of 5-dimensional manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. In particular, for noncollapsed limits of Einstein 5-manifolds, we prove that
  (1) tangent cones are unique of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ on the top stratum, hence outside a countable set of points; this follows from a new isolation result for cones of the form $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^4/\Gamma$ among all tangent cones,
  (2) the singular set is entirely contained in a countable union of Lipschitz curves and points,
  (3) away from a nowhere dense subset, these Lipschitz curves consist of smooth geodesics,
  (4) the interior of any geodesic is removable: limits of Einstein manifolds are real-analytic orbifolds with singularities along geodesic and bounded curvature away from their extreme points, and
  (5) if an asymptotically Ricci-flat 5-manifold with Euclidean volume growth has one tangent cone at infinity that splits off a line, then it is the unique tangent cone at infinity.
  These results prompt the question of the orbifold regularity of noncollapsed limits of Einstein manifolds off a codimension 5 set in arbitrary dimension.
  The proofs rely on a new result of independent interest: all spherical and hyperbolic 4-orbifolds are isolated among Einstein 4-orbifolds in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. This yields various gap theorems for Einstein 4-orbifolds, which do not extend to higher dimensions. The proofs of these gap theorems require a careful analysis of singular metrics and families of metrics that degenerate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a lower bound, in terms of the isoperimetric deficit, for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with negative boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in the hyperbolic space. This implies that the geodesic ball maximizes this eigenvalue among all such domains, thereby providing a partial resolution to an open problem posed by Celentano, Krej\v{c}i\v{r}\'{i}k and Lotoreichik in \cite{CKL26}. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with positive boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in the hyperbolic space.</description>
