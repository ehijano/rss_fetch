      <title>Simulation studies of a high-repetition-rate electron-driven surface muon beamline at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01597</link>

Abstract: A high-repetition-rate pulsed muon source operating at approximately 50\,kHz holds the potential to improve the sensitivity of various particle physics and material science experiments involving muons. In this article, we propose utilizing the high-repetition-rate pulsed electron beam at the SHINE facility to generate a surface muon beam. Our simulation studies indicate that an 8\,GeV, 100\,pC charge pulsed electron beam impinging on a copper target can produce up to $2 \times 10^{3}$ muons per pulse. Beamline optimization results demonstrate that approximately 60 surface muons per electron bunch can be efficiently transported to the end of the beamline. This translates to a surface muon rate of $3 \times 10^{6}\,\mu^{+}$/s when the pulsed electron beam is operated at 50\,kHz, which is comparable to existing muon facilities. This high-repetition-rate pulsed muon beam, with its ideal time structure, represents a unique and pioneering effort once constructed. It serves as a model for building cost-effective muon sources at existing electron machines with GeV electron energies. The main challenge of positron removal is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Orbit-Controlled Generation of Two-color Attosecond Mode-locked Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of attosecond X-ray pulses has garnered significant attention within the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) community due to their potential for ultrafast time-resolved studies. Attosecond pulses enable the investigation of electron dynamics with unprecedented temporal resolution, opening new avenues in fields such as quantum control and ultrafast spectroscopy. In an FEL, the mode-locking technique synthesizes a comb of longitudinal modes by applying spatiotemporal shifts between the co-propagating radiation and the electron bunch. We propose a novel scheme for generating two-color attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses via orbit control in two-stage mode-locked undulators. Specifically, a chicane with a wiggler inserted in the middle generates periodic temporal-transverse modulation in the electron beam. In this configuration, the low-energy and high-energy components of the beam lase in separate undulator sections, each producing attosecond mode-locked FEL pulses. Using a representative set of realistic parameters, three-dimensional simulations show that trains of 250-attosecond soft X-ray pulses at the gigawatt level can be independently generated in each undulator section. The interval between the two pulse trains can be adjusted over a range of several hundred femtoseconds.</description>
