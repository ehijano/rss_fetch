      <title>Vector Quantized-Elites: Unsupervised and Problem-Agnostic Quality-Diversity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity algorithms have transformed optimization by prioritizing the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions over a single optimal result. However, traditional Quality-Diversity methods, such as MAP-Elites, rely heavily on predefined behavioral descriptors and complete prior knowledge of the task to define the behavioral space grid, limiting their flexibility and applicability. In this work, we introduce Vector Quantized-Elites (VQ-Elites), a novel Quality-Diversity algorithm that autonomously constructs a structured behavioral space grid using unsupervised learning, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. At the core of VQ-Elites is the integration of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders, which enables the dynamic learning of behavioral descriptors and the generation of a structured, rather than unstructured, behavioral space grid - a significant advancement over existing unsupervised Quality-Diversity approaches. This design establishes VQ-Elites as a flexible, robust, and task-agnostic optimization framework. To further enhance the performance of unsupervised Quality-Diversity algorithms, we introduce two key components: behavioral space bounding and cooperation mechanisms, which significantly improve convergence and performance. We validate VQ-Elites on robotic arm pose-reaching and mobile robot space-covering tasks. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently generate diverse, high-quality solutions, emphasizing its adaptability, scalability, robustness to hyperparameters, and potential to extend Quality-Diversity optimization to complex, previously inaccessible domains.</description>

      <title>A Case Study on Evaluating Genetic Algorithms for Early Building Design Optimization: Comparison with Random and Grid Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In early-stage architectural design, optimization algorithms are essential for efficiently exploring large and complex design spaces under tight computational constraints. While prior research has benchmarked various optimization methods, their findings often lack generalizability to real-world, domain-specific problems, particularly in early building design optimization for energy performance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for early design optimization, focusing on their ability to find near-optimal solutions within limited timeframes. Using a constrained case study, we compare a simple GA to two baseline methods, Random Search (RS) and Grid Search (GS), with each algorithm tested 10 times to enhance the reliability of the conclusions. Our findings show that while RS may miss optimal solutions due to its stochastic nature, it was unexpectedly effective under tight computational limits. Despite being more systematic, GS was outperformed by RS, likely due to the irregular design search space. This suggests that, under strict computational constraints, lightweight methods like RS can sometimes outperform more complex approaches like GA. As this study is limited to a single case under specific constraints, future research should investigate a broader range of design scenarios and computational settings to validate and generalize the findings. Additionally, the potential of Random Search or hybrid optimization methods should be further investigated, particularly in contexts with strict computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Landscape of the Indicator-based Subset Selection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indicator-based subset selection problem (ISSP) involves finding a point subset that minimizes or maximizes a quality indicator. The ISSP is frequently found in evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO). An in-depth understanding of the landscape of the ISSP could be helpful in developing efficient subset selection methods and explaining their performance. However, the landscape of the ISSP is poorly understood. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the landscape of the ISSP by using various traditional landscape analysis measures and exact local optima networks (LONs). This paper mainly investigates how the landscape of the ISSP is influenced by the choice of a quality indicator and the shape of the Pareto front. Our findings provide insightful information about the ISSP. For example, high neutrality and many local optima are observed in the results for ISSP instances with the additive $\epsilon$-indicator.</description>

      <title>TensorNEAT: A GPU-accelerated Library for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm has received considerable recognition in the field of neuroevolution. Its effectiveness is derived from initiating with simple networks and incrementally evolving both their topologies and weights. Although its capability across various challenges is evident, the algorithm's computational efficiency remains an impediment, limiting its scalability potential. To address these limitations, this paper introduces TensorNEAT, a GPU-accelerated library that applies tensorization to the NEAT algorithm. Tensorization reformulates NEAT's diverse network topologies and operations into uniformly shaped tensors, enabling efficient parallel execution across entire populations. TensorNEAT is built upon JAX, leveraging automatic function vectorization and hardware acceleration to significantly enhance computational efficiency. In addition to NEAT, the library supports variants such as CPPN and HyperNEAT, and integrates with benchmark environments like Gym, Brax, and gymnax. Experimental evaluations across various robotic control environments in Brax demonstrate that TensorNEAT delivers up to 500x speedups compared to existing implementations, such as NEAT-Python. The source code for TensorNEAT is publicly available at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/tensorneat.</description>

      <title>'Neural howlround' in large language models: a self-reinforcing bias phenomenon, and a dynamic attenuation solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven AI systems may exhibit an inference failure mode we term `neural howlround,' a self-reinforcing cognitive loop where certain highly weighted inputs become dominant, leading to entrenched response patterns resistant to correction. This paper explores the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, which is distinct from model collapse and biased salience weighting. We propose an attenuation-based correction mechanism that dynamically introduces counterbalancing adjustments and can restore adaptive reasoning, even in `locked-in' AI systems. Additionally, we discuss some other related effects arising from improperly managed reinforcement. Finally, we outline potential applications of this mitigation strategy for improving AI robustness in real-world decision-making tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multi-Objective Collaborative Optimization of Doped Thermoelectric Materials via Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric performance of materials exhibits complex nonlinear dependencies on both elemental types and their proportions, rendering traditional trial-and-error approaches inefficient and time-consuming for material discovery. In this work, we present a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting thermoelectric properties of doped materials directly from their chemical formulas, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To enhance interpretability, we further incorporate sensitivity analysis techniques to elucidate how physical descriptors affect the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT). Moreover, we establish a coupled framework that integrates a surrogate model with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to efficiently explore the vast compositional space for high-performance candidates. Experimental validation confirms the discovery of a novel thermoelectric material with superior $zT$ values in the medium-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>DeQompile: quantum circuit decompilation using genetic programming for explainable quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains.
  This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Annealed Mean Field Descent Is Highly Effective for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, formulating various combinatorial optimization problems as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) has gained significant attention as a promising approach for efficiently obtaining optimal or near-optimal solutions. While QUBO offers a general-purpose framework, existing solvers often struggle with performance variability across different problems.
  This paper (i) theoretically analyzes Mean Field Annealing (MFA) and its variants--which are representative QUBO solvers, and reveals that their underlying self-consistent equations do not necessarily represent the minimum condition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the mean-field approximated distribution and the exact distribution, and (ii) proposes a novel method, the Annealed Mean Field Descent (AMFD), which is designed to address this limitation by directly minimizing the divergence.
  Through extensive experiments on five benchmark combinatorial optimization problems (Maximum Cut Problem, Maximum Independent Set Problem, Traveling Salesman Problem, Quadratic Assignment Problem, and Graph Coloring Problem), we demonstrate that AMFD exhibits superior performance in many cases and reduced problem dependence compared to state-of-the-art QUBO solvers and Gurobi--a state-of-the-art versatile mathematical optimization solver not limited to QUBO.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Neural Networks Can Stably Memorize Random Spike Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper explores the capability of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to store and recall precisely timed scores of spike trains. We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.
  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system, and understanding its mechanisms has been a long-standing challenge in neuroscience. The study of the functional connectome, which maps the functional connections between different brain regions, has provided valuable insights through various advanced analysis techniques developed over the years. Similarly, neural networks, inspired by the brain's architecture, have achieved notable success in diverse applications but are often noted for their lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that bridges neural networks and human brain functions by leveraging brain-inspired techniques. Our approach, grounded in the insights from the functional connectome, offers scalable ways to characterize topology of large neural networks using stable statistical and machine learning techniques. Our empirical analysis demonstrates its capability to enhance the interpretability of neural networks, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bridging Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization and GPU Acceleration via Tensorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

      <title>Range, not Independence, Drives Modularity in Biologically Inspired Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06232v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.</description>
