      <title>On Stronger Computational Separations Between Multimodal and Unimodal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multimodal machine learning, multiple modalities of data (e.g., text and images) are combined to facilitate the learning of a better machine learning model, which remains applicable to a corresponding unimodal task (e.g., text generation). Recently, multimodal machine learning has enjoyed huge empirical success (e.g. GPT-4). Motivated to develop theoretical justification for this empirical success, Lu (NeurIPS '23, ALT '24) introduces a theory of multimodal learning, and considers possible separations between theoretical models of multimodal and unimodal learning. In particular, Lu (ALT '24) shows a computational separation, which is relevant to worst-case instances of the learning task.
  In this paper, we give a stronger average-case computational separation, where for "typical" instances of the learning task, unimodal learning is computationally hard, but multimodal learning is easy. We then question how "organic" the average-case separation is. Would it be encountered in practice? To this end, we prove that under natural conditions, any given computational separation between average-case unimodal and multimodal learning tasks implies a corresponding cryptographic key agreement protocol. We suggest to interpret this as evidence that very strong computational advantages of multimodal learning may arise infrequently in practice, since they exist only for the "pathological" case of inherently cryptographic distributions. However, this does not apply to possible (super-polynomial) statistical advantages.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Flow Matching in Latent Space with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical convergence guarantees for ODE-based generative models, specifically flow matching. We use a pre-trained autoencoder network to map high-dimensional original inputs to a low-dimensional latent space, where a transformer network is trained to predict the velocity field of the transformation from a standard normal distribution to the target latent distribution. Our error analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showing that the distribution of samples generated via estimated ODE flow converges to the target distribution in the Wasserstein-2 distance under mild and practical assumptions. Furthermore, we show that arbitrary smooth functions can be effectively approximated by transformer networks with Lipschitz continuity, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression with Soft Inequality and Monotonicity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression is a non-parametric, Bayesian framework to approximate complex models. Standard GP regression can lead to an unbounded model in which some points can take infeasible values. We introduce a new GP method that enforces the physical constraints in a probabilistic manner. This GP model is trained by the quantum-inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QHMC). QHMC is an efficient way to sample from a broad class of distributions. Unlike the standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in which a particle has a fixed mass, QHMC allows a particle to have a random mass matrix with a probability distribution. Introducing the QHMC method to the inequality and monotonicity constrained GP regression in the probabilistic sense, our approach improves the accuracy and reduces the variance in the resulting GP model. According to our experiments on several datasets, the proposed approach serves as an efficient method as it accelerates the sampling process while maintaining the accuracy, and it is applicable to high dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Rate-Adaptive Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributed and rate-adaptive feature compression for linear regression. A set of distributed sensors collect disjoint features of regressor data. A fusion center is assumed to contain a pretrained linear regression model, trained on a dataset of the entire uncompressed data. At inference time, the sensors compress their observations and send them to the fusion center through communication-constrained channels, whose rates can change with time. Our goal is to design a feature compression {scheme} that can adapt to the varying communication constraints, while maximizing the inference performance at the fusion center. We first obtain the form of optimal quantizers assuming knowledge of underlying regressor data distribution. Under a practically reasonable approximation, we then propose a distributed compression scheme which works by quantizing a one-dimensional projection of the sensor data. We also propose a simple adaptive scheme for handling changes in communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the distributed adaptive compression scheme through simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved model-free bounds for multi-asset options using option-implied information and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the computation of model-free bounds for multi-asset options in a setting that combines dependence uncertainty with additional information on the dependence structure. More specifically, we consider the setting where the marginal distributions are known and partial information, in the form of known prices for multi-asset options, is also available in the market. We provide a fundamental theorem of asset pricing in this setting, as well as a superhedging duality that allows to transform the maximization problem over probability measures in a more tractable minimization problem over trading strategies. The latter is solved using a penalization approach combined with a deep learning approximation using artificial neural networks. The numerical method is fast and the computational time scales linearly with respect to the number of traded assets. We finally examine the significance of various pieces of additional information. Empirical evidence suggests that "relevant" information, i.e. prices of derivatives with the same payoff structure as the target payoff, are more useful that other information, and should be prioritized in view of the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Narratives to Numbers: Valid Inference Using Language Model Predictions from Verbal Autopsy Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings where most deaths occur outside the healthcare system, verbal autopsies (VAs) are a common tool to monitor trends in causes of death (COD). VAs are interviews with a surviving caregiver or relative that are used to predict the decedent's COD. Turning VAs into actionable insights for researchers and policymakers requires two steps (i) predicting likely COD using the VA interview and (ii) performing inference with predicted CODs (e.g. modeling the breakdown of causes by demographic factors using a sample of deaths). In this paper, we develop a method for valid inference using outcomes (in our case COD) predicted from free-form text using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. This method, which we call multiPPI++, extends recent work in "prediction-powered inference" to multinomial classification. We leverage a suite of NLP techniques for COD prediction and, through empirical analysis of VA data, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling transportability issues. multiPPI++ recovers ground truth estimates, regardless of which NLP model produced predictions and regardless of whether they were produced by a more accurate predictor like GPT-4-32k or a less accurate predictor like KNN. Our findings demonstrate the practical importance of inference correction for public health decision-making and suggests that if inference tasks are the end goal, having a small amount of contextually relevant, high quality labeled data is essential regardless of the NLP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Masked Completion via Structured Diffusion with White-Box Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern learning frameworks often train deep neural networks with massive amounts of unlabeled data to learn representations by solving simple pretext tasks, then use the representations as foundations for downstream tasks. These networks are empirically designed; as such, they are usually not interpretable, their representations are not structured, and their designs are potentially redundant. White-box deep networks, in which each layer explicitly identifies and transforms structures in the data, present a promising alternative. However, existing white-box architectures have only been shown to work at scale in supervised settings with labeled data, such as classification. In this work, we provide the first instantiation of the white-box design paradigm that can be applied to large-scale unsupervised representation learning. We do this by exploiting a fundamental connection between diffusion, compression, and (masked) completion, deriving a deep transformer-like masked autoencoder architecture, called CRATE-MAE, in which the role of each layer is mathematically fully interpretable: they transform the data distribution to and from a structured representation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our analytical insights. CRATE-MAE demonstrates highly promising performance on large-scale imagery datasets while using only ~30% of the parameters compared to the standard masked autoencoder with the same model configuration. The representations learned by CRATE-MAE have explicit structure and also contain semantic meaning. Code is available at https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/CRATE .</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sampling Policies Imply Biased Beliefs: A Generalization of the Hot Stove Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hot Stove Effect is a negativity bias resulting from the adaptive character of learning. The mechanism is that learning algorithms that pursue alternatives with positive estimated values, but avoid alternatives with negative estimated values, will correct errors of overestimation but fail to correct errors of underestimation. Here, we generalize the theory behind the Hot Stove Effect to settings in which negative estimates do not necessarily lead to avoidance but to a smaller sample size (i.e., a learner selects fewer of alternative B if B is believed to be inferior but does not entirely avoid B). We formally demonstrate that the negativity bias remains in this set-up. We also show there is a negativity bias for Bayesian learners in the sense that most such learners underestimate the expected value of an alternative.</description>

      <title>Guarantees of confidentiality via Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting privacy during inference with deep neural networks is possible by adding noise to the activations in the last layers prior to the final classifiers or other task-specific layers. The activations in such layers are known as "features" (or, less commonly, as "embeddings" or "feature embeddings"). The added noise helps prevent reconstruction of the inputs from the noisy features. Lower bounding the variance of every possible unbiased estimator of the inputs quantifies the confidentiality arising from such added noise. Convenient, computationally tractable bounds are available from classic inequalities of Hammersley and of Chapman and Robbins -- the HCR bounds. Numerical experiments indicate that the HCR bounds are on the precipice of being effectual for small neural nets with the data sets, "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10," which contain 10 classes each for image classification. The HCR bounds appear to be insufficient on their own to guarantee confidentiality of the inputs to inference with standard deep neural nets, "ResNet-18" and "Swin-T," pre-trained on the data set, "ImageNet-1000," which contains 1000 classes. Supplementing the addition of noise to features with other methods for providing confidentiality may be warranted in the case of ImageNet. In all cases, the results reported here limit consideration to amounts of added noise that incur little degradation in the accuracy of classification from the noisy features. Thus, the added noise enhances confidentiality without much reduction in the accuracy on the task of image classification.</description>

      <title>Global Momentum Compression for Sparse Communication in Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.12948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of data, distributed momentum stochastic gradient descent~(DMSGD) has been widely used in distributed learning, especially for training large-scale deep models. Due to the latency and limited bandwidth of the network, communication has become the bottleneck of distributed learning. Communication compression with sparsified gradient, abbreviated as \emph{sparse communication}, has been widely employed to reduce communication cost. All existing works about sparse communication in DMSGD employ local momentum, in which the momentum only accumulates stochastic gradients computed by each worker locally. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called \emph{\underline{g}}lobal \emph{\underline{m}}omentum \emph{\underline{c}}ompression~(GMC), for sparse communication. Different from existing works that utilize local momentum, GMC utilizes global momentum. Furthermore, to enhance the convergence performance when using more aggressive sparsification compressors (e.g., RBGS), we extend GMC to GMC+. We theoretically prove the convergence of GMC and GMC+. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces global momentum for sparse communication in distributed learning. Empirical results demonstrate that, compared with the local momentum counterparts, our GMC and GMC+ can achieve higher test accuracy and exhibit faster convergence, especially under non-IID data distribution.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Stochastic Optimization for Imputation in Massive Medical Data Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been a recognized problem that many datasets contain significant levels of missing numerical data. A potentially critical predicate for application of machine learning methods to datasets involves addressing this problem. However, this is a challenging task. In this paper, we apply a recently developed multi-level stochastic optimization approach to the problem of imputation in massive medical records. The approach is based on computational applied mathematics techniques and is highly accurate. In particular, for the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) this multi-level formulation is exact, and is significantly faster and more numerically stable. This permits practical application of Kriging methods to data imputation problems for massive datasets. We test this approach on data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data records, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Numerical results show that the multi-level method significantly outperforms current approaches and is numerically robust. It has superior accuracy as compared with methods recommended in the recent report from HCUP. Benchmark tests show up to 75% reductions in error. Furthermore, the results are also superior to recent state of the art methods such as discriminative deep learning.</description>

Abstract: This paper fills the limited statistical understanding of Shapley values as a variable importance measure from a nonparametric (or smoothing) perspective. We introduce population-level \textit{Shapley curves} to measure the true variable importance, determined by the conditional expectation function and the distribution of covariates. Having defined the estimand, we derive minimax convergence rates and asymptotic normality under general conditions for the two leading estimation strategies. For finite sample inference, we propose a novel version of the wild bootstrap procedure tailored for capturing lower-order terms in the estimation of Shapley curves. Numerical studies confirm our theoretical findings, and an empirical application analyzes the determining factors of vehicle prices.</description>

      <title>Trust Your $\nabla$: Gradient-based Intervention Targeting for Causal Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13715v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring causal structure from data is a challenging task of fundamental importance in science. Observational data are often insufficient to identify a system's causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e., experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel Gradient-based Intervention Targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts' the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to provide signals for the intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data regime.</description>

      <title>Estimating Treatment Effects using Multiple Surrogates: The Role of the Surrogate Score and the Surrogate Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.09326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the long-term effects of treatments is of interest in many fields. A common challenge in estimating such treatment effects is that long-term outcomes are unobserved in the time frame needed to make policy decisions. One approach to overcome this missing data problem is to analyze treatments effects on an intermediate outcome, often called a statistical surrogate, if it satisfies the condition that treatment and outcome are independent conditional on the statistical surrogate. The validity of the surrogacy condition is often controversial. Here we exploit that fact that in modern datasets, researchers often observe a large number, possibly hundreds or thousands, of intermediate outcomes, thought to lie on or close to the causal chain between the treatment and the long-term outcome of interest. Even if none of the individual proxies satisfies the statistical surrogacy criterion by itself, using multiple proxies can be useful in causal inference. We focus primarily on a setting with two samples, an experimental sample containing data about the treatment indicator and the surrogates and an observational sample containing information about the surrogates and the primary outcome. We state assumptions under which the average treatment effect be identified and estimated with a high-dimensional vector of proxies that collectively satisfy the surrogacy assumption, and derive the bias from violations of the surrogacy assumption, and show that even if the primary outcome is also observed in the experimental sample, there is still information to be gained from using surrogates.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Atari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00374v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn effective policies for complex tasks, such as Atari games, even from image observations. However, this typically requires very large amounts of interaction -- substantially more, in fact, than a human would need to learn the same games. How can people learn so quickly? Part of the answer may be that people can learn how the game works and predict which actions will lead to desirable outcomes. In this paper, we explore how video prediction models can similarly enable agents to solve Atari games with fewer interactions than model-free methods. We describe Simulated Policy Learning (SimPLe), a complete model-based deep RL algorithm based on video prediction models and present a comparison of several model architectures, including a novel architecture that yields the best results in our setting. Our experiments evaluate SimPLe on a range of Atari games in low data regime of 100k interactions between the agent and the environment, which corresponds to two hours of real-time play. In most games SimPLe outperforms state-of-the-art model-free algorithms, in some games by over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Neural Networks for Macroeconomic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04752v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroeconomic data is characterized by a limited number of observations (small T), many time series (big K) but also by featuring temporal dependence. Neural networks, by contrast, are designed for datasets with millions of observations and covariates. In this paper, we develop Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that are well-suited for handling datasets commonly used for macroeconomic analysis in policy institutions. Our approach avoids extensive specification searches through a novel mixture specification for the activation function that appropriately selects the form of nonlinearities. Shrinkage priors are used to prune the network and force irrelevant neurons to zero. To cope with heteroskedasticity, the BNN is augmented with a stochastic volatility model for the error term. We illustrate how the model can be used in a policy institution by first showing that our different BNNs produce precise density forecasts, typically better than those from other machine learning methods. Finally, we showcase how our model can be used to recover nonlinearities in the reaction of macroeconomic aggregates to financial shocks.</description>

      <title>Will My Robot Achieve My Goals? Predicting the Probability that an MDP Policy Reaches a User-Specified Behavior Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an autonomous system performs a task, it should maintain a calibrated estimate of the probability that it will achieve the user's goal. If that probability falls below some desired level, it should alert the user so that appropriate interventions can be made. This paper considers settings where the user's goal is specified as a target interval for a real-valued performance summary, such as the cumulative reward, measured at a fixed horizon $H$. At each time $t \in \{0, \ldots, H-1\}$, our method produces a calibrated estimate of the probability that the final cumulative reward will fall within a user-specified target interval $[y^-,y^+].$ Using this estimate, the autonomous system can raise an alarm if the probability drops below a specified threshold. We compute the probability estimates by inverting conformal prediction. Our starting point is the Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) method of Romano et al., which applies split-conformal prediction to the results of quantile regression. CQR is not invertible, but by using the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) as the non-conformity measure, we show how to obtain an invertible modification that we call Probability-space Conformalized Quantile Regression (PCQR). Like CQR, PCQR produces well-calibrated conditional prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal guarantees. By inverting PCQR, we obtain guarantees for the probability that the cumulative reward of an autonomous system will fall below a threshold sampled from the marginal distribution of the response variable (i.e., a calibrated CDF estimate) that we employ to predict coverage probabilities for user-specified target intervals. Experiments on two domains confirm that these probabilities are well-calibrated.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Randomized Network Resource Allocation with Long-Term Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal online resource reservation problem in a simple communication network. The network is composed of two compute nodes linked by a local communication link. The system operates in discrete time; at each time slot, the administrator reserves resources for servers before the actual job requests are known. A cost is incurred for the reservations made. Then, after the client requests are observed, jobs may be transferred from one server to the other to best accommodate the demands by incurring an additional transport cost. If certain job requests cannot be satisfied, there is a violation that engenders a cost to pay for each of the blocked jobs. The goal is to minimize the overall reservation cost over finite horizons while maintaining the cumulative violation and transport costs under a certain budget limit. To study this problem, we first formalize it as a repeated game against nature where the reservations are drawn randomly according to a sequence of probability distributions that are derived from an online optimization problem over the space of allowable reservations. We then propose an online saddle-point algorithm for which we present an upper bound for the associated K-benchmark regret together with an upper bound for the cumulative constraint violations. Finally, we present numerical experiments where we compare the performance of our algorithm with those of simple deterministic resource allocation policies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network for Dynamic Reconfiguration of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To maintain a reliable grid we need fast decision-making algorithms for complex problems like Dynamic Reconfiguration (DyR). DyR optimizes distribution grid switch settings in real-time to minimize grid losses and dispatches resources to supply loads with available generation. DyR is a mixed-integer problem and can be computationally intractable to solve for large grids and at fast timescales. We propose GraPhyR, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNNs) framework tailored for DyR. We incorporate essential operational and connectivity constraints directly within the GNN framework and train it end-to-end. Our results show that GraPhyR is able to learn to optimize the DyR task.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble Diversity for Robust Self-Training in the Presence of Sample Selection Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14814v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training is a well-known approach for semi-supervised learning. It consists of iteratively assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data for which the model is confident and treating them as labeled examples. For neural networks, softmax prediction probabilities are often used as a confidence measure, although they are known to be overconfident, even for wrong predictions. This phenomenon is particularly intensified in the presence of sample selection bias, i.e., when data labeling is subject to some constraint. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence measure, called $\mathcal{T}$-similarity, built upon the prediction diversity of an ensemble of linear classifiers. We provide the theoretical analysis of our approach by studying stationary points and describing the relationship between the diversity of the individual members and their performance. We empirically demonstrate the benefit of our confidence measure for three different pseudo-labeling policies on classification datasets of various data modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/ambroiseodt/tsim.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Non-Convex Optimization under the KL Condition with Optimal Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study private empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem for losses satisfying the $(\gamma,\kappa)$-Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition. The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition is a special case of this condition when $\kappa=2$. Specifically, we study this problem under the constraint of $\rho$ zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). When $\kappa\in[1,2]$ and the loss function is Lipschitz and smooth over a sufficiently large region, we provide a new algorithm based on variance reduced gradient descent that achieves the rate $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^\kappa\big)$ on the excess empirical risk, where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension. We further show that this rate is nearly optimal. When $\kappa \geq 2$ and the loss is instead Lipschitz and weakly convex, we show it is possible to achieve the rate $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^\kappa\big)$ with a private implementation of the proximal point method. When the KL parameters are unknown, we provide a novel modification and analysis of the noisy gradient descent algorithm and show that this algorithm achieves a rate of $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^{\frac{2\kappa}{4-\kappa}}\big)$ adaptively, which is nearly optimal when $\kappa = 2$. We further show that, without assuming the KL condition, the same gradient descent algorithm can achieve fast convergence to a stationary point when the gradient stays sufficiently large during the run of the algorithm. Specifically, we show that this algorithm can approximate stationary points of Lipschitz, smooth (and possibly nonconvex) objectives with rate as fast as $\tilde{O}\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)$ and never worse than $\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}\big)^{1/2}\big)$. The latter rate matches the best known rate for methods that do not rely on variance reduction.</description>

      <title>ReCoRe: Regularized Contrastive Representation Learning of World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have demonstrated human-level effectiveness in gaming environments, their success in everyday tasks like visual navigation has been limited, particularly under significant appearance variations. This limitation arises from (i) poor sample efficiency and (ii) over-fitting to training scenarios. To address these challenges, we present a world model that learns invariant features using (i) contrastive unsupervised learning and (ii) an intervention-invariant regularizer. Learning an explicit representation of the world dynamics i.e. a world model, improves sample efficiency while contrastive learning implicitly enforces learning of invariant features, which improves generalization. However, the na\"ive integration of contrastive loss to world models is not good enough, as world-model-based RL methods independently optimize representation learning and agent policy. To overcome this issue, we propose an intervention-invariant regularizer in the form of an auxiliary task such as depth prediction, image denoising, image segmentation, etc., that explicitly enforces invariance to style interventions. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL methods and significantly improves on out-of-distribution point navigation tasks evaluated on the iGibson benchmark. With only visual observations, we further demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent language-guided foundation models for point navigation, which is essential for deployment on robots with limited computation capabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model excels at the sim-to-real transfer of its perception module on the Gibson benchmark.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs of Diagonal Fisher Information Matrix Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher information matrix characterizes the local geometry in the parameter space of neural networks. It elucidates insightful theories and useful tools to understand and optimize neural networks. Given its high computational cost, practitioners often use random estimators and evaluate only the diagonal entries. We examine two such estimators, whose accuracy and sample complexity depend on their associated variances. We derive bounds of the variances and instantiate them in regression and classification networks. We navigate trade-offs of both estimators based on analytical and numerical studies. We find that the variance quantities depend on the non-linearity with respect to different parameter groups and should not be neglected when estimating the Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interactive particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial within the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interactive particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Empowering Credit Scoring Systems with Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>
