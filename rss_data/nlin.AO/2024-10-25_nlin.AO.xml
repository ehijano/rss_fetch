      <title>Complexity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic model for complexity control (CC) between systems, represented by time series characterized by different temporal complexity measures, as indicated by their respective inverse power law (IPL) indices. Given the apparent straightforward character of the model and the generality of the result, we formulate a hypothesis based on the closeness of the scaling measures of the model to the empirical complexity measures of the human brain. CC is a proper model for describing the recent experimental results, such as the rehabilitation in walking arm in arm and the complexity synchronization effect. The CC effect can lead to the design of mutual-adaptive signals to restore the misaligned complexity of maladjusted organ networks or, on the other hand, to disrupt the complexity of a malicious system and lower its intelligent behavior.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis in a Generalized Kuramoto Model with a Simplified Realistic Coupling Function and Inhomogeneous Coupling Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hysteresis in a generalized Kuramoto model with identical oscillators, focusing on coupling strength inhomogeneity, which results in oscillators being coupled to others with varying strength, and a simplified, more realistic coupling function. With the more realistic coupling function and the coupling strength inhomogeneity, each oscillator acquires an effective intrinsic frequency proportional to its individual coupling strength. This is analogous to the positive coupling strength-frequency correlation introduced explicitly or implicitly in some previous models with nonidentical oscillators that show explosive synchronization and hysteresis. Through numerical simulations and analysis using truncated Gaussian, uniform, and truncated power-law coupling strength distributions, we observe that the system can exhibit abrupt phase transitions and hysteresis. The distribution of coupling strengths significantly affects the hysteresis regions within the parameter space of the coupling function. Additionally, numerical simulations of models with weighted networks including a brain network confirm the existence of hysteresis due to the realistic coupling function and coupling strength inhomogeneity, suggesting the broad applicability of our findings to complex real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via non-local visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>
