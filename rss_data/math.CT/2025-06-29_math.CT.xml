      <title>Rigid Algebras and Cospans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce rigid algebras, a generalization of rigid categories to arbitrary symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-categories. We develop their general theory, showing in particular that the a priori $(\infty,2)$-category of rigid algebras is in fact an $(\infty,1)$-category. For the $(\infty,2)$-category of cospans in an $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we show that the $(\infty,1)$-category of rigid commutative algebras is canonically identified with $\mathcal{C}$. This identification is used to construct an adjunction between the cospan construction and the functor assigning to a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category its $(\infty,1)$-category of rigid commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional TFTs via modular $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This lecture series is based on joint work in progress with Shaul Barkan, as well as work in progress of the author. The five sections of these notes correspond to the five lectures, but more details have been added.
  $2$-dimensional topological field theories ($2$D TFTs) valued in vector spaces are commutative Frobenius algebras. The goal of this lecture series is to generalize from the $1$-category of vector spaces to any symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. to study symmetric monoidal functors $\mathrm{Bord}_2 \to \mathcal{C}$. Choosing $\mathcal{C}$ to be the $(2,1)$-category of linear categories, this recovers a definition of modular functors, and choosing it to be the derived category of a ring yields a notion closely related to cohomological field theories. We will introduce a notion of modular $\infty$-operads and algebras over them, construct the modular $\infty$-operad of surfaces $\mathcal{M}$, and show that algebras over $\mathcal{M}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are exactly $2$D TFTs valued in $\mathcal{C}$. Along the way we will encounter variants modular $\infty$-operads (such as cyclic $\infty$-operads and $\infty$-properads) as well as a proof of the $1$D cobordism hypothesis with singularities. This uses some (mild) $\infty$-category theory, but no familiarity with ($\infty$-)operads will be assumed. The main goal will be to filter $\mathcal{M}$ by genus to obtain an obstruction-theoretic description of $2$D TFTs with general target. Applying this to invertible TFTs one can construct a new spectral sequence exhibiting relations between the cohomology groups of moduli spaces of curves.</description>

      <title>Existence Theorem for Cumulative Universe Towers and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds a cumulative tower of Grothendieck universes that provides a precise size discipline for higher type theory. Starting from an increasing sequence of inaccessible cardinals, we give an inductive-recursive definition of universe codes, their decoding functor, and a rank that controls the growth of each code. For every level of the tower we prove closure under dependent products, dependent sums, identity types, and all finite limits and colimits; the colimit part is obtained with a rank-stable quotient constructor. A universe-lifting operation shows strict cumulativity across levels. Assuming propositional resizing at one level, we construct an explicit left adjoint to the inclusion of minus-one truncated types and show that resizing automatically lifts to every higher level. These ingredients combine in an Existence Theorem stating that, over Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the chosen inaccessible cardinals, the tower delivers a sound set-theoretic model of higher type theory. The results supply the size infrastructure required for forthcoming work on Rezk completions and higher topos models.</description>

      <title>Relating insplittings of 2-graphs and of textile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graphical operation of insplitting is key to understanding conjugacy of shifts of finite type (SFTs) in both one and two dimensions. In this paper, we consider two approaches to studying 2-dimensional SFTs: textile systems and rank-2 graphs. Nasu's textile systems describe all two-sided 2D SFTs up to conjugacy, whereas the 2-graphs (higher-rank graphs of rank 2) introduced by Kumjian and Pask yield associated C*-algebras. Both models have a naturally-associated notion of insplitting. We show that these notions do not coincide, raising the question of whether insplitting a 2-graph induces a conjugacy of the associated one-sided 2-dimensional SFTs.
  Our first main result shows how to reconstruct 2-graph insplitting using textile-system insplits and inversions, and consequently proves that 2-graph insplitting induces a conjugacy of dynamical systems. We also present several other facets of the relationship between 2-graph insplitting and textile-system insplitting. Incorporating an insplit of the bottom graph of the textile system turns out to be key to this relationship. By articulating the connection between operator-algebraic and dynamical notions of insplitting in two dimensions, this article lays the groundwork for a C*-algebraic framework for classifying one-sided conjugacy in higher-dimensional SFTs.</description>

      <title>Chevalley property and discriminant ideals of Cayley-Hamilton Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any affine Hopf algebra $H$ which admits a large central Hopf subalgebra, $H$ can be endowed with a Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra structure in the sense of De Concini-Procesi-Reshetikhin-Rosso. The category of finite-dimensional modules over any fiber algebra of $H$ is proved to be an indecomposable exact module category over the tensor category of finite-dimensional modules over the identity fiber algebra $H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H$ of $H$. For any affine Cayley-Hamilton Hopf algebra $(H,C,\text{tr})$ such that $H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H$ has the Chevalley property, it is proved that if the zero locus of a discriminant ideal of $(H,C,\text{tr})$ is non-empty then it contains the orbit of the identity element of the affine algebraic group $\text{maxSpec}C$ under the left (or right) winding automorphism group action. Its proof relies on the fact that $H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H$ has the Chevalley property if and only if the $\overline{\varepsilon}$-Chevalley locus of $(H,C)$ coincides with $\text{maxSpec}C$.
  As applications, we first provide a description of the zero locus of the lowest discriminant ideal of $(H,C,\text{tr})$. It is proved that the lowest discriminant ideal of $(H,C,\text{tr})$ is of level $\text{FPdim}(\text{Gr}(H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H))+1$, where $\text{Gr}(H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H)$ is the Grothendieck ring of the finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H$ and $\text{FPdim}(\text{Gr}(H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H))$ is the Frobenius-Perron dimension of $\text{Gr}(H/\mathfrak{m}_{\overline{\varepsilon}}H)$. Some recent results of Mi-Wu-Yakimov about lowest discriminant ideals are generalized. Secondly, we prove that all the discriminant ideals are trivial if $H$ has the Chevalley property.</description>

      <title>Scott's Representation Theorem and the Univalent Karoubi Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lambek and Scott constructed a correspondence between simply-typed lambda calculi and Cartesian closed categories. Scott's Representation Theorem is a cousin to this result for untyped lambda calculi. It states that every untyped lambda calculus arises from a reflexive object in some category. We present a formalization of Scott's Representation Theorem in univalent foundations, in the (Rocq-)UniMath library. Specifically, we implement two proofs of that theorem, one by Scott and one by Hyland. We also explain the role of the Karoubi envelope -- a categorical construction -- in the proofs and the impact the chosen foundation has on this construction. Finally, we report on some automation we have implemented for the reduction of $\lambda$-terms.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Monoidal Algebra: Axiomatising Distance with String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: String diagrammatic calculi have become increasingly popular in fields such as quantum theory, circuit theory, probabilistic programming, and machine learning, where they enable resource-sensitive and compositional algebraic analysis. Traditionally, the equations of diagrammatic calculi only axiomatise exact semantic equality. However, reasoning in these domains often involves approximations rather than strict equivalences. In this work, we develop a quantitative framework for diagrammatic calculi, where one may axiomatise notions of distance between string diagrams. Unlike similar approaches, such as the quantitative theories introduced by Mardare et al., this requires us to work in a monoidal rather than a cartesian setting. We define a suitable notion of monoidal theory, the syntactic category it freely generates, and its models, where the concept of distance is established via enrichment over a quantale. To illustrate the framework, we provide examples from probabilistic and linear systems analysis.</description>
