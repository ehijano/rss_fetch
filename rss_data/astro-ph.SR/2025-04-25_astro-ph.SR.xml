      <title>The black hole - pair instability boundary for high stellar rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pair Instability (PI) boundary is crucial for understanding heavy merging Black Holes (BHs) and the second mass gap's role in galactic chemical evolution. So far, no works have critically and systematically examined how rotation and mass loss affect the PI boundary or BH masses below it. Rapid rotation significantly alters stellar structure and mass loss, which is expected to have significant effects on the evolution of stellar models. We have previously derived a critical core mass independent of stellar evolution parameters, finding the BH (Pulsational) PI boundary at $M_{ CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$ for a carbon-oxygen (CO) core. Using MESA, we model massive stars around the PI boundary for varying rotation rates and metallicities. We implement mechanical mass loss in MESA, studying its effects on massive stars in low-metallicity environments. Below $1/100$th $Z_\odot$, mechanical mass loss dominates over radiative winds. We check the BH-PI boundary for rapid rotators to confirm our critical core mass criterion and derive model fits describing rotation's impact on core and final masses. Fast rotators reach a point (typically $\Omega / \Omega_{crit} \approx 0.6$) where the entire star becomes chemically homogeneous, evolving like a stripped star. This lowers the maximum BH mass before PI to its critical core mass of $M_{CO, crit} = 36.3 M_\odot$, aligning with the bump feature in the BH mass distribution observed by LIGO/VIRGO.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding stellar variability at the sub m/s level: Isolating granulation signals in synthetic spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granulation in the photospheres of FGK-type stars induces variability in absorption lines, complicating exoplanet detection via radial velocities and characterisation via transmission spectroscopy. We aim to quantify the impact of granulation on the radial velocity and bisector asymmetry of stellar absorption lines of varying strengths and at different limb angles. We use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations from MURaM paired with MPS-ATLAS radiative transfer calculations to synthesise time series' for four Fe I lines at different limb angles for a solar-type star. Our line profiles are synthesised at an extremely high resolution (R = 2,000,000), exceeding what is possible observationally and allowing us to capture intricate line shape variations. We introduce a new method of classifying the stellar surface into three components and use this to parameterise the line profiles. Our parameterisation method allows us to disentangle the contributions from p-modes and granulation, providing the unique opportunity to study the effects of granulation without contamination from p-mode effects. We validate our method by comparing radial velocity power spectra of our granulation time series to observations from the LARS spectrograph. We find that we are able to replicate the granulation component extracted from observations of the Fe I 617 nm line at the solar disk centre. We use our granulation-isolated results to show variations in convective blueshift and bisector asymmetry at different limb angles, finding good agreement with empirical results. We show that weaker lines have higher velocity contrast between granules and lanes, resulting in higher granulation-induced velocity fluctuations. Our parameterisation provides a computationally efficient strategy to construct new line profiles, laying the groundwork for future improvements in mitigating stellar noise in exoplanet studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Solar Spectral Irradiance (SSI) from Iron lines using the COronal DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model version 1.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COronal DEnsity and Temperature (CODET) model is a physics-based model (Rodr\'iguez-G\'omez et al. 2018; Rodr\'iguez-G\'omez 2017) . This model uses the relationship between the magnetic field, density, temperature, and EUV emission. This model provides mean daily Solar Spectral Irradiance time series in EUV wavelengths in long time scales from days to solar cycles. The current manuscript presents the updated/new CODET model version 1.1. It uses observational datasets from SDO/EVE MEGS-A at $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths to obtain the goodness-of-fit between them and the modeled SSI from April 30, 2010, to May 26, 2014. The model described well observational data during that period, with less than $20\%$ error in both wavelengths. Additionally, SSI predictions are provided using the new model parameters from July 1996 to October 2024, where SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI photospheric magnetic field data are available. These predictions were compared with GOES/EUVS at $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and mean daily values of SDO/AIA at $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$ data, with errors of $\sim 26\%$ and $42\%$ for $28.4 \ \mathrm{nm}$ and $21.1 \ \mathrm{nm}$, respectively. The error analysis for model fitting and predictions shows how accurate the model predictions are. Thus, the CODET model provides a reliable estimate of the Solar Spectral Irradiance time series in EUV wavelengths where no observational data is available, e.g., after the SDO/EVE MEGS-A era.</description>

      <title>ALEXIS: Recreating the X-Ray Emission from the Full Solar Disk as a Linear Combination of Discrete Regions in the Extreme Ultraviolet and Soft X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a wealth of multi-wavelength, spatially resolved, time-domain solar activity data, an accurate and complete temporo-spatial solar flare census is unavailable, which impedes our understanding of the physics of flare production. We present an Automatically Labeled EUV and X-ray Incident SolarFlares (ALEXIS) pipeline, designed to decompose the X-Ray flux of the full solar disk into a minimum set of discrete regions on the Solar surface. ALEXIS returns an average RMSE between the XRS time series and the discrete EUV signals of 0.066 $\pm$ 0.036 for a randomly selected test bed sample of 1000 hour-long data segments from May 2010 - March 2020. Flare emission that requires multiple regions was found to be synchronous: flares occurring at the same time, sympathetic: flares separated by minutes, or needed to capture the background emission before and/or after the main flare. ALEXIS uses the original full resolution and cadence of both the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly Instrument and the GOES13-15 Solar X-Ray Imager. Comparison of the ALEXIS catalog with those produced by SWPC and SolarSoft show that these canonical databases need revisiting for 62$\%$ and 15$\%$ of the sub-sample, respectively. Additionally, we increased the number of flares reported by SWPC and SolarSoft by 15$\%$. Our pipeline misses 6.7$\%$ of the 1057 flare sub-sample and returns 5$\%$ of false positives from 1211 flares reported by ALEXIS. The ALEXIS catalog returns flare peak times, coordinates, the corrected scaled XRay magnitude, and the associated NOAA active region with a HARP identifier number independently from any external data products.</description>

      <title>Excitation of post-AGB Star Binary Eccentricity by Massive Polar-Aligned Circumbinary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many post-AGB star binaries are observed to have relatively high orbital eccentricities (up to 0.6). Recently, AC Her was observed to have a polar-aligned circumbinary disk. We perform hydrodynamic simulations to explore the impact of a polar-aligned disk on the eccentricity of a binary. For a binary system with central masses of 0.73 M_sun and 1.4 M_sun, we find that a disk with a total mass of 0.1 M_sun can enhance the binary eccentricity from 0.2 to 0.7 within 5000 years, or from 0.01 to 0.65 within 15000 years. Even if the disk mass is as low as 0.01 M_sun, the binary eccentricity grows within our simulation time while the system remains stable. These eccentricity variations are associated with the variations of the inclination between the disk and the binary orbit due to von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations. The oscillations eventually damp and leave the binary eccentricity at a high value. The numerical results are in good agreement with analytical estimates. In addition, we examine the AC-Her system and find that the disk mass should be on the order of 10^(-3)M_sun for the disk to remain polar.</description>

      <title>Three new 2+2 quadruple systems with changing inclination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unique discovery of three new detected systems showing two different phenomena together. These are 2+2 quadruple stellar systems showing two eclipsing binaries as the inner pairs. And besides that, these systems were also found to exhibit the precession of the inner orbits causing the inclination changes manifesting themselves through the eclipse depth variations. We are not aware of any similar known system on the sky nowadays, hence our discovery is really unique. In particular these systems are: CzeV4315 = HD 228777 (periods 6.7391 d and 0.91932 d, inclination change of pair B of about 1.4deg/yr); ASASSN-V J075203.23-323102.7 = GDS_J0752031-323102 (8.86916 d + 2.6817 d, inclination change of pair B of about 1.03deg/yr, now only ellipsoidal variations); ASASSN-V J105824.33-611347.6 = TIC 465899856 (2.3304 d + 13.0033 d, inclination change of pair B, now undetectable). These systems provide us unique insight into the quadruple-star dynamics, including the orbit-orbit interaction, Kozai-Lidov cycles, and testing the stellar formation theories of these higher order multiples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) contains a wealth of information to advance our knowledge of stellar physics. In these lecture notes we introduce the data products from GDR3 that can be exploited by the stellar physics community. Then we visit different regions of the HR diagram, discuss the open scientific questions, and describe how GDR3 can help advance this particular topic. Specific regions include hot OB and A type stars, FGK main sequence, giants, and variable sources, low mass stars, and ultra-cool dwarfs. Examples of scientific exploitation are also provided. These lecture notes are accompanied by a 3-hour lecture presentation and a 3-hour practical session that are publicly available on the website of the Ecole Evry Schatzman 2023: Stellar physics with Gaia, https://ees2023.sciencesconf.org/, see Lectures and Hands-on Work.</description>

      <title>Hemispheric Distribution of Solar Active Regions During Solar Cycles 23-25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) are crucial for understanding the long-term evolution of solar activities and predicting eruptive phenomena, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections. However, the cycle-dependent properties in the north-south asymmetry of ARs have not been fully understood. In this study, we investigate the hemispheric distribution of ARs from Carrington Rotation 1909 to 2278 (between 1996 May and 2023 November) by using three parameters that describe the magnetic field distribution of ARs: number, area, and flux. The main findings are as follows: (1) The three AR parameters show significant hemispheric asymmetry in cycles 23-25. The strong correlation between AR area and flux indicates that they can better reflect the intrinsic properties of solar magnetic field. (2) The correlation between sunspot activity and AR parameters varies in the two hemispheres across the different cycles. The AR parameters provide additional information for the variations in sunspot activity, which can better predict the intensity and cyclical changes of solar activity. (3) The variation in the fitting slope sign of the asymmetry index for AR parameters reflects periodic changes in hemispheric ARs, providing valuable insights into the activity of other stars. (4) Both the dominant hemisphere and the cumulative trend of AR parameters display a cycle-dependent behavior. Moreover, the trend variations of AR area and flux are similar, reflecting the long-term evolutionary characteristics of solar magnetic field. Our analysis results are relevant for understanding the hemispheric coupling of solar magnetic activity and its cyclic evolutionary patterns.</description>

      <title>A New Age-Activity Relation For Solar Analogs that Accounts for Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining stellar ages is challenging, particularly for cooler main-sequence stars. Magnetic evolution offers an observational alternative for age estimation via the age-chromospheric activity (AC) relation. We evaluate the impact of metallicity on this relation using near one-solar-mass stars across a wide metallicity range. We analyze a sample of 358 solar-type stars with precise spectroscopic parameters determined through a line-by-line differential technique and with ages derived using Yonsei-Yale isochrones. We measured chromospheric activity (S-index) using high-quality HARPS spectra, calibrated to the Mount Wilson system, and converted to the $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ index with a temperature-based photospheric correction. Our findings show that the AC relation for $R^{\prime}_{\mathrm HK}(T_{\mathrm{eff}})$ is strongly influenced by metallicity. We propose a new age-activity-metallicity relation for solar-type main-sequence (MS) stars ($\log{g} \gtrsim 4.2 $) with temperatures 5370 $\lesssim$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $\lesssim$ 6530 K and metallicities from -0.7 to +0.3 dex. We show that taking metallicity into account significantly enhances chromospheric ages' reliability, reducing the residuals' root mean square (RMS) relative to isochronal ages from 2.6 Gyr to 0.92 Gyr. This reflects a considerable improvement in the errors of chromospheric ages, from 53\% to 15\%. The precision level achieved in this work is also consistent with previous age-activity calibration from our group using solar twins.</description>

      <title>The stellar corona-chromosphere connection. A comprehensive study of X-ray and Ca II IRT fluxes from eROSITA and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar activity can be observed at different wavelengths in a variety of different activity indicators. We investigated the correlation between coronal and chromospheric emissions by combining X-ray data from stars detected in the eROSITA all-sky surveys (eRASS1 and eRASS:5) with Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) activity indices as published in the third Gaia data release (Gaia DR3). We specifically studied 24 300 and 43 200 stellar sources with reliable Ca II IRT measurement and X-ray detection in eRASS1 and eRASS:5, which is by far the largest stellar sample available so far. The largest detection fraction is obtained for highly active sources and stars of a late spectral type, while F-type and less active stars (as measured in the Ca II IRT) remain mostly undetected in X-rays. Also, the correlation is the strongest for late-type sources, while F-type stars show a rather weak correlation between the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio and the Ca II IRT activity index. The relation between the X-ray and Ca II IRT surface fluxes changes with the fractional X-ray flux without showing two separated branches as described in previous studies. For fast rotators, both activity indicators saturate at a similar Rossby number and the X-ray to bolometric flux ratio decreases faster than the IRT index for slower rotating stars. As a consequence, the ratio between X-ray and IRT fluxes is constant in the saturation regime and decreases for slow rotators.</description>

      <title>The NewEra model grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of stellar spectra, stellar populations, and transit light curves rely on grids of synthetic spectra and center-to-limb variations (limb darkening) from model stellar atmospheres. Extensive model grids from PHOENIX, a generalized non-LTE 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere code, have found widespread use in the astronomical community, however current PHOENIX/1D models have been substantially improved over the last decade. To make these improvements available to the community, we have constructed the NewEra LTE model grid consisting of 37438 models with $2300K \leq T_{eff} \leq 12000K$, $0.0\le log{(g)} \le 6.0$ metallicities [M/H] from $-4.0$ to $+0.5$, and for metallicities $-2.0 \le [M/H] \le 0.0$ additional $\alpha$ element variations from $-0.2 \le [\alpha/{\rm Fe}] \le +1.2$ are included. The models use databases of 851 million atomic lines and 834 billion molecular lines and employ the Astrophysical Chemical Equilibrium Solver for the equation of state. All models in the NewEra grid have been calculated in spherical symmetry because center-to-limb variation differences from plane-parallel models are quite large for giants and not insignificant for dwarfs. All model data are provided in the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) format, including low and high sampling rate spectra. These files also include a variety of details about the models, such as the exact abundances and isotopic patterns used and results of the atomic and molecular line selection. Although the model structures have small differences with the previous grid generation, the spectra show significant differences, mostly due to the updates of the molecular line lists.</description>

While the precision of data has improved significantly in recent years, stellar models used for age inference have not improved at a similar rate. In fact, different models yield notably different age predictions for the same observational data. In this paper, we assess the difference in age predictions of various widely used model grids for stars along the red giant branch. Using open source software, we conduct a comparison of four different evolution grids and we find that age estimations become less reliable if stellar mass is not known, with differences occasionally exceeding $80\%$. Additionally, we note significant disagreements in the models' age estimations at non-solar metallicity. Finally, we present a method for including theoretical uncertainties from stellar evolutionary tracks in age inferences of red giants, aimed at improving the accuracy of age estimation techniques used in the galactic archaeology community.</description>

      <title>Insights from Analytical Theory of Eccentric Circumbinary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric cavities in circumbinary disks precess on timescales much longer than the binary orbital period. These long-lived steady states can be understood as trapped modes in an effective potential primarily determined by the binary quadrupole and the inner-disk pressure support, with associated frequencies $\omega_Q$ and $\omega_P$. Within this framework, we show that the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$ is the main parameter determining the mode spectrum, and obtain a thorough understanding of it by systematically solving this problem with various degrees of sophistication. We first find analytical solutions for truncated power-law disks and use this insight in disks with smooth central cavities. Our main findings are: (i) The number of modes increases for thinner disks and more-equal-mass binaries. (ii) For 2D disks, the normalized ground-mode frequency, $\omega_0/(\omega_Q+\omega_P)$, decreases monotonically with the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$. (iii) For thin disks, $\omega_P\ll\omega_Q$, the ground-mode frequency coincides with the maximum of the effective potential, which tracks the gravitational quadrupole frequency inside the inner-disk cavity, and is thus rather sensitive to the density profile of the cavity, where these modes are localized. (iv) For thick disks, $\omega_P\gg\omega_Q$, increasing pressure support anchors the peak of the effective potential at the inner cavity radius as the ground-mode extends farther out and its frequency decreases. (v) In agreement with numerical simulations, with $\omega_P/\omega_Q \simeq 0.1$, we find that disk precession is rather insensitive to the density profile and ground-mode frequencies for 3D disks are about half the value for 2D disks.</description>

      <title>Spectral Irradiance Variability in Lyman-Alpha Emission During Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Ly{\alpha};1216 {\AA}) line is the brightest emission line in the quiescent solar spectrum and radiates a significant fraction of the available nonthermal energy during flares. Despite its importance, there is a lack of detailed studies of Ly{\alpha} spectral variability during flares. Recently, spectrally resolved Ly{\alpha} flare observations from the SORCE/SOLSTICE instrument have become available. This study examines Ly{\alpha} spectral variability and its relationship with HXR emission from nonthermal electrons, using observations of two M-class flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE and RHESSI. Imaging observations from STEREO/SECCHI EUVI and SDO/AIA provide further context. Enhancements across the Ly{\alpha} line profile were found to closely correlate with bursts of HXR emission, suggesting a primarily nonthermal origin. Red enhancement asymmetries at the peak of each flare were attributed to chromospheric evaporation, while blue wing enhancement and blue asymmetry were linked to a bright filament-eruption seen in SDO/AIA 1600 {\AA} images. These findings contribute to the understanding of spectral Ly{\alpha} variability during flares and highlight the need for future studies using a higher quality and quantity of spectral Ly{\alpha} flare observations. Such studies will further characterise the physical mechanisms driving Ly{\alpha} flare variability.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of blue stragglers in $\omega$ Centauri: the case of five double-mode radial SX Phoenicis pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first extensive seismic modelling of SX Phe stars in the stellar system $\omega$ Cen. First, using the new values of reddening $E(B-V)$ and distance modulus $(m-M)_V$, and bolometric corrections from Kurucz model atmospheres, we determine the effective temperatures and luminosities of all SX Phe variables in $\omega$ Cen with available $(B-V)$ colours. Next, we carefully select SX Phe stars that have a frequency ratio strongly suggesting excitation of two radial modes, and, in addition, their preliminary pulsational models have the values of $(T_{\rm eff},~ L)$ consistent with observational determinations. For five double-mode radial pulsators, we perform an extensive seismic modeling using the Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations. We study the effect of opacity tables and helium abundance. With the OPAL data and $Y=0.30$, we obtained masses in the range (1.0,~1.2) M$_{\odot}$, metallicity $Z\in(0.0007,~0.0029)$ and the age of about (1.9,~3.8) Gyr. The OP and OPLIB seismic models have always higher metallicites, sometimes outside the allowed range for $\omega$ Cen. In the case of three stars, we find seismic models within the observed range of $(T_{\rm eff},~L)$ with all three opacity tables. In the case of two stars, with the highest metallicity, seismic models computed with the OP and OPLIB tables are located far outside the observed error box. The OPAL seismic models follow the age$-$metallicity relation known for $\omega$ Cen from the literature.</description>

      <title>Introducing STARDIS: An Open and Modular Stellar Spectral Synthesis Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new 1D stellar spectral synthesis Python code called \stardis. \stardis\ is a modular, open-source radiative transfer code that is capable of spectral synthesis from near-UV to IR for FGK stars. We describe the structure, inputs, features, underlying physics, and assumptions of \stardis\ as well as the radiative transfer scheme implemented. To validate our code, we show spectral comparisons between \stardis\ and \textsc{korg} with the same input atmospheric structure models, and also compare qualitatively to \textsc{phoenix} for solar models. We find that \stardis\ generally agrees well with \textsc{korg} for solar models on the few percent level or better, that the codes can diverge in the ultraviolet, with more extreme differences in cooler stars. \stardis\ can be found at \href{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis}{https://github.com/tardis-sn/stardis}, and documentation can be found at \href{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}{https://tardis-sn.github.io/stardis/}.</description>

      <title>Dynamic atmosphere and wind models of C-type asymptotic giant branch stars. Influences of dust optical data on mass loss and observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss through stellar winds governs the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). In the case of carbon-rich AGB stars, the wind is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on amorphous carbon (amC) dust forming in the atmosphere. The choice of dust optical data will have a significant impact on atmosphere and wind models of AGB stars. We compare two commonly used optical data sets of amC and investigate how the wind characteristics and photometric properties resulting from dynamical models of carbon-rich AGB stars are influenced by the micro-physical properties of dust grains. We computed two extensive grids of carbon star atmosphere and wind models with the DARWIN 1D radiation-hydrodynamical code. Each of the two grids uses a different amC optical data set. The stellar parameters of the models were varied to cover a wide range of possible combinations. A posteriori radiative transfer calculations were performed for a sub-set of the models, resulting in photometric fluxes and colours. We find small, but systematic differences in the predicted mass-loss rates for the two grids. The grain sizes and photometric properties are affected by the different dust optical data sets. Higher absorption efficiency leads to the formation of a greater number of grains, which are smaller. Models that are obscured by dust exhibit differences in terms of the covered colour range compared to observations, depending on the dust optical data used. An important motivation for this study was to investigate how strongly the predicted mass-loss rates depend on the choice of dust optical data, as these mass-loss values are more frequently used in stellar evolution models. Based on the current results, we conclude that mass-loss rates may typically differ by about a factor of two for DARWIN models of C-type AGB stars for commonly used dust optical data sets.</description>

      <title>Thermal Emission and Confirmation of the Frigid White Dwarf Exoplanet WD 1856+534b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of thermal emission from and confirm the planetary nature of WD 1856+534b, the first transiting planet known to orbit a white dwarf star. Observations with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveal excess mid-infrared emission from the white dwarf, consistent with a closely-orbiting Jupiter-sized planet with a temperature of $186^{+6}_{-7}$ K. We attribute this excess flux to the known giant planet in the system, making it the coldest exoplanet from which light has ever been directly observed. These measurements constrain the planet's mass to no more than six times that of Jupiter, confirming its planetary nature and ruling out previously unexcluded low-mass brown dwarf scenarios. WD 1856+534b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's "forbidden zone", a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits, including the habitable zone, around white dwarfs is possible. With an age nearly twice that of the Solar System and a temperature akin to our own gas giants, WD 1856+534b demonstrates JWST's unprecedented ability to detect and characterize cold, mature exoplanets, opening new possibilities for imaging and characterizing these worlds in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>A Search for Planet Nine with IRAS and AKARI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outer solar system is theoretically predicted to harbour an undiscovered planet, often referred to as P9. Simulations suggest that its gravitational influence could explain the unusual clustering of minor bodies in the Kuiper Belt. However, no observational evidence for P9 has been found so far, as its predicted orbit lies far beyond Neptune, where it reflects only a faint amount of Sunlight. This work aims to find P9 candidates by taking advantage of two far-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two surveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the ~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point source list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which includes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after months. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI detections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and orbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature to ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and flux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the catalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular separations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth masses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our candidate.</description>

      <title>A negative stellar mass$-$gaseous metallicity gradient relation of dwarf galaxies modulated by stellar feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic cycling is reflected in the spatial distribution of metallicity within galaxies, yet gas-phase metallicity distribution and its connection with other properties of dwarf galaxies are largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities for a sample of 55 normal nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies (stellar mass $M_\star$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{9.5}\ M_\odot$), based on MUSE spectroscopic observations. We find that metallicity gradient shows a significant negative correlation (correlation coefficient $r \approx -0.56$) with $\log M_\star$, in contrast to the flat or even positive correlation observed for higher-mass galaxies. This negative correlation is accompanied by a stronger central suppression of metallicity compared to the outskirts in lower-mass galaxies. Among the other explored galaxy properties-including baryonic mass, star formation distribution, galaxy environment, regularity of the gaseous velocity field, and effective yield of metals $y_{\rm eff}$-only the velocity field regularity and $y_{\rm eff}$ show residual correlation with the metallicity gradient after controlling for $M_\star$, in the sense that galaxies with irregular velocity fields or lower $y_{\rm eff}$ tend to have less negative or more positive gradients. Particularly, a linear combination of $\log M_\star$ and $\log y_{\rm eff}$ significantly improves the correlation with metallicity gradient ($r \approx -0.68$) compared to $\log M_\star$ alone. The lack of correlation with environment disfavors gas accretion as a dominant factor. Our findings imply that metal mixing and transport processes, including but not limited to feedback-driven outflows, are more important than in-situ metal production in shaping the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Nearby open clusters with tidal features: golden sample selection and 3D structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters offer unique opportunities to study stellar dynamics and evolution under the influence of their internal gravity, the Milky Way's gravitational field, and the interactions with encounters. Using the Gaia DR3 data for a catalog of open clusters within 500 parsecs that exhibit tidal features reported by the literature, we apply a novel method based on 3D principal component analysis to select a ``golden sample'' of nearby open clusters with minimal line-of-sight distortions. This approach ensures a systematic comparison of 3D and 2D structural parameters for tidally perturbed clusters. The selected golden sample includes Blanco 1, Melotte 20, Melotte 22, NGC 2632, NGC 7092, NGC 1662, Roslund 6 and Melotte 111. We analyze these clusters by fitting both 2D and 3D King Profiles to their stellar density distributions. Our results reveal systematic discrepancies: most of the golden sample clusters exhibit larger 3D tidal radii compared to their 2D counterparts, demonstrating that the 2D projection effects bias the measured cluster size. Furthermore, the 3D density profiles show stronger deviations from King profiles at the tidal radii ($\Delta \rho_{\rm 3D} &gt; \Delta \rho_{\rm 2D}$), highlighting enhanced sensitivity to tidal disturbances. Additionally, we investigate the spatial distribution of cluster members relative to their bulk motion in the Galactic plane. We find that some clusters exhibit tidal features oriented perpendicular to their direction of motion, which can be attributed to the fact that the current surveys only detect the curved inner regions of the tidal features. In conclusion, this work offers a golden sample of nearby open clusters that are most reliable for 3D structure analysis and underscores the necessity of 3D analysis in characterizing OC morphological asymmetries, determining cluster size, and identifying tidal features.</description>

      <title>Observation-Based Iterative Map for Solar Cycles. I. Nature of Solar Cycle Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inter-cycle variations in the series of 11-year solar activity cycles have a significant impact on both the space environment and climate. Whether solar cycle variability is dominated by deterministic chaos or stochastic perturbations remains an open question. Distinguishing between the two mechanisms is crucial for predicting solar cycles. Here we reduce the solar dynamo process responsible for the solar cycle to a one-dimensional iterative map, incorporating recent advance in the observed nonlinearity and stochasticity of the cycle. We demonstrate that deterministic chaos is absent in the nonlinear system, regardless of model parameters, if the generation of the poloidal field follows an increase-then-saturate pattern as the cycle strength increases. The synthesized solar cycles generated by the iterative map exhibit a probability density function (PDF) similar to that of observed normal cycles, supporting the dominant role of stochasticity in solar cycle variability. The parameters governing nonlinearity and stochasticity profoundly influence the PDF. The iterative map provides a quick and effective tool for predicting the range, including uncertainty of the subsequent cycle strength when an ongoing cycle amplitude is known. Due to stochasticity, a solar cycle loses almost all its original information within 1 or 2 cycles. Although the simplicity of the iterative map, the behaviors it exhibits are generic for the nonlinear system. Our results provide guidelines for analyzing solar dynamo models in terms of chaos and stochasticity, highlight the limitation in predicting solar cycle, and motivate further refinement of observational constraints on nonlinear and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aditya-L1, India's first dedicated mission to study the Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on 2023 September 2. It carries seven payloads. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on Aditya-L1. VELC is designed to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in the continuum at 5000 A, with a field of view (FoV) from 1.05 Ro to 3 Ro can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of the solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303 A Fexiv, 7892 A Fexi, and 10747 A Fexiii are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50 um, separated by 3.75 mm help to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to +/-1.5 Ro. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747 A also in the FoV range 1.05 - 1.5 Ro. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using a laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport energy throughout the solar atmosphere. Here we investigate the contribution from MHD waves to the Poynting flux in a 3D numerical simulation of a realistic solar atmosphere, modelling a structure resembling a solar vortex tube, using the PLUTO code in the presence of different plasma flow configurations. These simulations feature a closed magnetic loop system where a rotational flow is imposed at one foot-point in addition to photospheric perturbations acting as a wave driver mimicking those of p-modes. We find that a variety of MHD waves exist within the vortex tube, including sausage, kink and torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves, owing to the photospheric wave driver and the nature of the rotational flow itself. We demonstrate how the visual interpretation of different MHD modes becomes non-trivial when a background rotational flow is present compared to a static flux tube. By conducting a simulation both with and without the rotational plasma flow, we demonstrate how the perturbed Poynting flux increases in the presence of the rotational flow as the waves transport increased magnetic energy. We attribute this increase to the dynamical pressure from the rotational flow increasing the plasma density at the tube boundary, which acts to trap the wave energy more effectively inside the vortex. Moreover, we demonstrate how the Poynting flux is always directed upwards in weakly twisted magnetic flux tubes.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of cosmic ray acceleration at both the wind termination shock and SNR shocks to the catalog of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we aim to identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadro-nuclear interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is identified, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-3 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Among these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data that our model can consistently describe. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Occurrence rates of accreting companions from a new method for computing emission-line survey sensitivity: application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>

Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alphaline luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-7 &lt; log MMdot &lt;-3) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Using our two accretion models, we find consistent protoplanet rates, with median and 68% credible intervals of 0.16 (+0.19, -0.10) and 0.22 (+0.26, -0.14) accreting companions per star, respectively. Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with Skyrme Lyon (SLy)/Brussels-Montreal Skyrme functionals (BSk) class equations of state (EOSs), along with the M\"uller-Serot (MS2) EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Are Kronberger 80 and/or Kronberger 82 regions PeVatron candidates for LHAASO J2108+5157?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays have been detected in the region of LHAASO~J2108+5157 by the Fermi--LAT, HAWC and LHAASO-KM2A observatories. Cygnus~OB2 in Cygnus--X has been confirmed as the first strong stellar cluster PeVatron in our Galaxy. Thus, the star--forming regions Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82, located in the field of LHAASO~J2108+5157, are analyzed to evaluate their stellar population and potential as associated PeVatron candidates. A distance of 10~kpc is adopted for Kronberger~80, while $\sim$1.6~kpc is estimated for Kronberger~82. Based on stellar densities, we report that their cluster radii are 2.5$\arcmin$ and 2.0$\arcmin$, while IR photometry reveals poor stellar content in massive O-type stars in both cases. From optical data, the estimation of cluster ages are 5--12.6~Myr and $\lesssim$ 5~Myr, respectively. We conclude that, in contrast to the stellar content of Cygnus~OB2, it is unlikely that Kronberger~80 and Kronberger~82 are PeVatrons associated with LHAASO~J2108+5157. The presence of a PeVatron in this region remains a mystery, but we confirm that the two Kronberger regions are star--forming regions undergoing formation rather than evolution.</description>
