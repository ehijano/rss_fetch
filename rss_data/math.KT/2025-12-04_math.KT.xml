      <title>Magnetic Equivariant Graded Brauer Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a magnetic finite group, we consider the similarity classes of magnetic equivariant central simple graded algebras over the complex numbers. We call this set the magnetic equivariant graded Brauer group and its structure as an abelian group is explicitly determined. Following Karoubi, we argue that the elements of this graded Brauer group parametrize the twistings of the magnetic equivariant K-theory of a point.</description>

      <title>Structure theorems for the heart of LCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohomology theories with values in LCA (locally compact abelian) groups suffer from the problem that the latter do not form an abelian category. However, the category LCA has a canonical abelian category envelope, the heart of a suitable t-structure. It adds formal cokernel objects. We show the surprising result that these abstract cokernels can also be interpreted as Hausdorff topological abelian groups, at least up to lattice isogenies. These need not be locally compact.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau structures on derived and singularity categories of symmetric orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct left and right Calabi-Yau structures on derived respectively singularity categories of symmetric orders $\Lambda$ over commutative Gorenstein rings $R$. For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $\Lambda$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $\Lambda$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and Asymptotic Formulas for Rectangular Partitions of the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-parameter generalization of the Catalan numbers: $C_{d,p}(n)$ is the number of ways to subdivide the $d$-dimensional hypercube into $n$ rectangular blocks using orthogonal partitions of fixed arity $p$. Bremner \&amp; Dotsenko introduced $C_{d,p}(n)$ in their work on Boardman--Vogt tensor products of operads; they used homological algebra to prove a recursive formula and a functional equation. We express $C_{d,p}(n)$ as simple finite sums, and determine their growth rate and asymptotic behaviour. We give an elementary proof of the functional equation, using a bijection between hypercube decompositions and a family of full $p$-ary trees. Our results generalize the well-known correspondence between Catalan numbers and full binary trees.</description>
