      <title>OpenAIs HealthBench in Action: Evaluating an LLM-Based Medical Assistant on Realistic Clinical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of 0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support assistant.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Deploying Adaptive Machine Learning Agents with Limited Data for Real-time Cell Culture Process Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the deployment of three machine learning (ML) approaches for real-time prediction of glucose, lactate, and ammonium concentrations in cell culture processes, using Raman spectroscopy as input features. The research addresses challenges associated with limited data availability and process variability, providing a comparative analysis of pretrained models, just-in-time learning (JITL), and online learning algorithms. Two industrial case studies are presented to evaluate the impact of varying bioprocess conditions on model performance. The findings highlight the specific conditions under which pretrained models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and identify scenarios where JITL or online learning approaches are more effective for adaptive process monitoring. This study also highlights the critical importance of updating the deployed models/agents with the latest offline analytical measurements during bioreactor operations to maintain the model performance against the changes in cell growth behaviours and operating conditions throughout the bioreactor run. Additionally, the study confirms the usefulness of a simple mixture-of-experts framework in achieving enhanced accuracy and robustness for real-time predictions of metabolite concentrations based on Raman spectral data. These insights contribute to the development of robust strategies for the efficient deployment of ML models in dynamic and changing biomanufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>Resilient Biosecurity in the Era of AI-Enabled Bioweapons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative biology have enabled the design of novel proteins, creating significant opportunities for drug discovery while also introducing new risks, including the potential development of synthetic bioweapons. Existing biosafety measures primarily rely on inference-time filters such as sequence alignment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction to detect dangerous outputs. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading PPI prediction tools: AlphaFold 3, AF3Complex, and SpatialPPIv2. These models were tested on well-characterized viral-host interactions, such as those involving Hepatitis B and SARS-CoV-2. Despite being trained on many of the same viruses, the models fail to detect a substantial number of known interactions. Strikingly, none of the tools successfully identify any of the four experimentally validated SARS-CoV-2 mutants with confirmed binding. These findings suggest that current predictive filters are inadequate for reliably flagging even known biological threats and are even more unlikely to detect novel ones. We argue for a shift toward response-oriented infrastructure, including rapid experimental validation, adaptable biomanufacturing, and regulatory frameworks capable of operating at the speed of AI-driven developments.</description>

      <title>A Wrist-Worn Multimodal Reaction Time Monitoring Device for Ecologically-Valid Cognitive Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaction time (RT) is a fundamental measure in cognitive and neurophysiological assessment, yet most existing RT systems require active user engagement and controlled environments, limiting their use in real-world settings. This paper introduces a low cost wrist-worn instrumentation platform designed to capture human reaction times (RT) across auditory, visual, and haptic modalities with millisecond latency in real-world conditions. The device integrates synchronized stimulus delivery and event detection within a compact microcontroller-based system, eliminating the need for user focus or examiner supervision. Emphasizing measurement fidelity, we detail the hardware architecture, timing control algorithms, and calibration methodology used to ensure consistent latency handling across modalities. A proof-of-concept study with six adult participants compares this system against a benchmark computer-based RT tool across five experimental conditions. The results confirm that the device achieves statistically comparable RT measurements with strong modality consistency, supporting its potential as a novel tool for non-obtrusive cognitive monitoring. Contributions include a validated design for time-critical behavioral measurement and a demonstration of its robustness in unconstrained, ambient-noise environments. It offers a powerful new tool for continuous, real-world cognitive monitoring and has significant potential for both research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prognostic Biomarker Discovery in Pancreatic Cancer Through Hybrid Ensemble Feature Selection and Multi-Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional survival settings.</description>

      <title>Remember when? Deciphering Ediacaran-Cambrian Metazoan behaviour and temporal memory using fossil movement paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the timing and trajectory of sensory system innovations is crucial for understanding the increase in phylogenetic, behavioural, and ecological diversity during the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Elucidation of sensory adaptations has relied on either body-fossil evidence based on anatomical features or qualitative descriptions of trace-fossil morphology, leaving a gap in the record of sensory system innovations between the development of basic sensory capacities and that of more advanced sensory organs and brains. Here, we examine fossil movement trajectories of Ediacaran and Cambrian grazers for the presence of autocorrelation. Our analysis reveals a lack of temporal correlation in the studied Ediacaran trajectories and its presence in both analysed Cambrian trajectories, indicating time-tuned behaviours were in place by the early Cambrian. These results support the Cambrian Information Revolution hypothesis and indicates that increases in cognitive complexity and behavioural strategies were yet another important evolutionary innovation that occurred during the Ediacaran Cambrian transition.</description>

      <title>epiGPTope: A machine learning-based epitope generator and classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids, making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope, pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes, which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences, which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant applications in the development of new biotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Enhanced Colorimetric Sensing: Achieving over 5700-fold Accuracy Improvement via Full-Spectrum Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional colorimetric sensing methods typically rely on signal intensity at a single wavelength, often selected heuristically based on peak visual modulation. This approach overlooks the structured information embedded in full-spectrum transmission profiles, particularly in intensity-based systems where linear models may be highly effective. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate that applying a forward feature selection strategy to normalized transmission spectra, combined with linear regression and ten-fold cross-validation, yields significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Using food dye dilutions as a model system, the mean squared error was reduced from over 22,000 with a single wavelength to 3.87 using twelve selected features, corresponding to a more than 5,700-fold enhancement. These results validate that full-spectrum modeling enables precise concentration prediction without requiring changes to the sensing hardware. The approach is broadly applicable to colorimetric assays used in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and industrial analysis, offering a scalable pathway to improve sensitivity and reliability in existing platforms.</description>

      <title>LINKER: Learning Interactions Between Functional Groups and Residues With Chemical Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning and Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth biochemical annotations.</description>

      <title>SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.</description>

      <title>Persistence diagrams as morphological signatures of cells: A method to measure and compare cells within a population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell biologists study in parallel the morphology of cells with the regulation mechanisms that modify this morphology. Such studies are complicated by the inherent heterogeneity present in the cell population. It remains difficult to define the morphology of a cell with parameters that can quantify this heterogeneity, leaving the cell biologist to rely on manual inspection of cell images. We propose an alternative to this manual inspection that is based on topological data analysis. We characterise the shape of a cell by its contour and nucleus. We build a filtering of the edges defining the contour using a radial distance function initiated from the nucleus. This filtering is then used to construct a persistence diagram that serves as a signature of the cell shape. Two cells can then be compared by computing the Wasserstein distance between their persistence diagrams. Given a cell population, we then compute a distance matrix that includes all pairwise distances between its members. We analyse this distance matrix using hierarchical clustering with different linkage schemes and define a purity score that quantifies consistency between those different schemes, which can then be used to assess homogeneity within the cell population. We illustrate and validate our approach to identify sub-populations in human mesenchymal stem cell populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins by formulating centrality detection as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the QUBO formulations are solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing. Applied to a diverse set of proteins, RinQ consistently identifies central residues that closely align with classical benchmarks, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the approach.</description>
