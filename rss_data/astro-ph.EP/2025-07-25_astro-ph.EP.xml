      <title>Recurrent Cometary Activity Discovered on Quasi-Hilda Jupiter Family Comet 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of recurrent activity on quasi-Hilda comet (QHC) 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion passage of 362P. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion in 2016 (Garcia-Migani &amp; Gil-Hutton 2018), so we were motivated to observe it for recurrent cometary activity near its next perihelion passage (UT 2024 July 20). We obtained observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) telescope, and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and identified a second activity epoch when 362P had a true anomaly (v) as early as 318.1 deg. We conducted archival searches of numerous repositories and identified images obtained with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Pan-STARRS 1, SkyMapper, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network data. Using these data, we identified activity from a previously unreported timespan, and we did not detect activity when 362P was away from perihelion, specifically 83 deg &lt; v &lt; 318 deg. Detection of activity near perihelion and absence of activity away from perihelion suggest thermally-driven activity and volatile sublimation. Our dynamical simulations suggest 362P is a QHC and it will remain in a combined Jupiter-family comet (JFC) and quasi-Hilda orbit over the next 1 kyr, though it will become increasingly chaotic nearing the end of this timeframe. Our backward simulations suggest 362P may have migrated from the orbit of a Long Period Comet (~53%) or Centaur (~32%), otherwise it remained a JFC (~15%) over the previous 100 kyr. We recommend additional telescope observations from the community as 362P continues outbound from its perihelion on UT 2024 July 20, as well as continued observations for a third activity epoch.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale radiative-transfer model of the protoplanetary disc DoAr 44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to construct a comprehensive global multi-scale kinematic equilibrium radiative-transfer model for the pre-transitional disc of DoAr 44 (Haro 1-16, V2062 Oph) in the Ophiuchus star-forming region. This model integrates diverse observational datasets to describe the system, spanning from the accretion region to the outer disc.
  Our analysis utilises a large set of observational data, including ALMA continuum complex visibilities, VLTI/GRAVITY continuum squared visibilities, closure phases, and triple products, as well as VLT/UVES and VLT/X-shooter H-alpha spectra. Additionally, we incorporated absolute flux measurements from ground-based optical observatories, Spitzer, IRAS, the Submillimeter Array, the IRAM, or the ATCA radio telescopes. These data sets were used to constrain the structure and kinematics of the object through radiative-transfer modelling.
  Our model reveals that the spectral line profiles are best explained by an optically thin spherical inflow/outflow within the co-rotation radius of the star, exhibiting velocities exceeding 380 km/s. The VLTI near-infrared interferometric observations are consistent with an inner disc extending from 0.1 to 0.2 au. The ALMA sub-millimetre observations indicate a dust ring located between 36 and 56 au, probably related to the CO2 condensation line. The global density and temperature profiles derived from our model provide insight into an intermediate disc, located in the terrestrial planet-forming zone, which has not yet been spatially resolved.</description>

      <title>The Response of Planetary Atmospheres to the Impact of Icy Comets II: exo-Earth Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital regime of a terrestrial planet plays a significant role in shaping its atmospheric dynamics, climate, and hence potential habitability. The orbit is also likely to play a role in shaping the response of a planetary atmosphere to the influx of material from an icy cometary impact. To investigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an Earth-analogue exoplanet (i.e. an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star with a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with the 3D Earth-System-Model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the atmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we compare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a tidally-locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of the planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy cometary impact. The weak, multi-celled circulation structure that forms on Earth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not vertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep break-up site to higher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at low pressures, reducing the magnitude of post-impact changes to composition. It also reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice formation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes to the overall composition of the planet persist to quasi-steady-state, reinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the composition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.</description>

      <title>Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that the model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how early-formed giant planets influence the formation of second-generation planets and planetesimals in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Three-step growth of vapor-deposited ice under mesospheric temperature and water vapor conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar mesospheric clouds provide clues to physicochemical processes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. However, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes of water ice under polar mesospheric conditions are poorly understood, especially at the nanoscale. This study used reflection high energy electron diffraction and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to analyze the structure of vapor-deposited ice at polar mesospheric temperature (120 K) under vapor pressure conditions. The ice appeared to grow in three steps during vapor deposition, being amorphous water for the first 15 nm, then cubic ice up to 50 nm, and finally hexagonal ice subsequently. This three step growth suggests that the three observed phases can coexist in polar mesospheric clouds, depending on the thickness of water ice. The finding of the three-step growth also shows that the Ostwald rule of stages can hold for vapor deposited ice at low temperature.</description>

      <title>One Year of ASPEX-STEPS Operation: Characteristic Features, Observations and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS), a subsystem of the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) onboard India's Aditya-L1 satellite, is designed to study different aspects of energetic particles in the interplanetary medium from the Sun-Earth L1 point using six detector units oriented in different directions. This article presents details of the one-year operation (08 January 2024 - 28 February 2025) of the AL1-ASPEX-STEPS after the insertion of the satellite into the final halo orbit around the L1 point with emphasis on performance, science observations, and scientific potentials. Four out of six AL1-ASPEX-STEPS units exhibit a stable detector response throughout the observation period, confirming operational robustness. This work also includes the temporal variation of particle fluxes, spectra of ions during selected quiet times and transient events, and cross-comparisons with existing instruments at the L1 point. A strong correlation (with coefficient of determination, R2 ~ 0.9) is observed in the cross-comparison study, establishing the reliability of the AL1- ASPEX-STEPS observations. AL1-ASPEX-STEPS also captures different forms of energetic ion spectra similar to those observed by previous missions. These results underscore the instrument's potential to contribute significantly to the study of energetic particle acceleration, transport, and long-term space weather monitoring from the Sun-Earth L1 vantage point.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem: Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids). 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the 5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>XUE 10. The CO2-rich terrestrial planet-forming region of an externally irradiated Herbig disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI MRS gas molecular content of an externally irradiated Herbig disk, the F-type XUE 10 source, in the context of the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program. XUE 10 belongs to the massive star cluster NGC 6357 (1.69 kpc), where it is exposed to an external far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation $\approx$ 10$^3$ times stronger than in the Solar neighborhood. We modeled the molecular features in the mid-infrared spectrum with Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) 0D slab models. We derived basic parameters of the stellar host from a VLT FORS2 optical spectrum using PHOENIX stellar templates. We detect bright CO2 gas with the first simultaneous detection (&gt; 5$\sigma$) of four isotopologues (12CO2, 13CO2, 16O12C18O, 16O12C17O) in a protoplanetary disk. We also detect faint CO emission (2$\sigma$) and the HI Pf$\alpha$ line (8$\sigma$). We also place strict upper limits on the water content, finding a total column density $\lesssim$ 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. The CO2 species trace low gas temperatures (300-370 K) with a range of column densities of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (16O12C17O)-1.3 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (12CO2) in an equivalent emitting radius of 1.15 au. The emission of 13CO2 is likely affected by line optical depth effects. 16O12C18O and 16O12C17O abundances may be isotopically anomalous compared to the 16O/18O and 16O/17O ratios measured in the interstellar medium and the Solar System. We propose that the mid-infrared spectrum of XUE 10 is explained by H2O removal either via advection or strong photo-dissociation by stellar UV irradiation, and enhanced local CO2 gas-phase production. Outer disk truncation supports the observed CO2-H2O dichotomy. A CO2 vapor enrichment in 18O and 17O can be explained by means of external UV irradiation and early on (10$^{4-5}$ yr) delivery of isotopically anomalous water ice to the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Inflated hot Jupiters: Inferring average atmospheric velocity via Ohmic models coupled with internal dynamo evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of hot Jupiters (HJ) represent a long-standing open issue. In this study, we quantitatively investigate this phenomenon within the framework of Ohmic dissipation arising from magnetic induction in the atmosphere, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. We simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets with MESA, spanning the observed range of masses and equilibrium temperatures, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation that extends to deep layers of the envelope. We infer average atmospheric wind intensities, averaged in the region $p &lt; 10$ bar, in the range 0.01-1 km/s in order to reproduce the range of observed radii, decreasing roughly linearly with planetary mass, and much more steeply with equilibrium temperature. This is consistent with the expected effects of magnetic drag from the induced field, which is higher for more intense irradiation, via conductivity, and for larger masses, which have higher dynamo fields. Due to the evolution of the dynamo field and the proportionality of the induced currents on it, the Ohmic efficiency typically decreases by at least one order of magnitude from 0.1 to 10 Gyr, at contrast with the common assumption of a constant-in-time value. Notably, the extent of the main convective region, and the associated heat flux supporting the dynamo, is reduced in the presence of strong Ohmic dissipation, which in turn depends on the dynamo field strength, generating a non-trivial coupling of the latter with the atmospheric induction, potentially leading to an oscillatory behaviour of the field strength. These findings remain generally valid even when accounting for a long-term increase in the main-sequence host star luminosity, although this case can more readily lead to HJ re-inflation, consistent with previous studies.</description>
