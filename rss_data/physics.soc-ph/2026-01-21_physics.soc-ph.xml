      <title>Low-Dimensional Interaction Spaces Impose Geometric Constraints On Collective Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective organization in physical, biophysical, and biological systems often emerges from many weak, local interactions, yet the resulting global structures display striking regularities and apparent limits in diversity. Existing theoretical approaches typically emphasize specific mechanisms, detailed dynamics, or energetic optimization, making it difficult to identify constraints that are independent of microscopic realization. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that, when effective interactions among system components compress into a low-dimensional interaction space, global organization is governed by geometric constraints rather than detailed dynamics. We formalize interaction spaces as metric manifolds derived from coarse-grained effective couplings and show that low interaction dimensionality imposes upper bounds on the number, separability, and robustness of distinct collective organizations. These results yield impossibility statements: many conceivable macroscopic organizations are excluded a priori, even when locally compatible interactions exist. The framework applies across equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems without assuming specific symmetries or conservation laws. By shifting the explanatory focus from generative mechanisms to structural constraints, this work establishes a general, geometry-based perspective on collective organization.</description>

      <title>Computation as Organisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation is commonly defined as the execution of abstract algorithms over symbolic representations, with physical systems treated as substrates that realise predefined operations. While effective for engineered machines, this separation becomes problematic when applied to living systems, where persistence, adaptation, and failure occur without symbolic instruction or central control. Here, computation is reformulated as a structural property of organised matter. Organisation is defined as the persistence of relational constraints that delimit admissible state transitions. Information is not encoded content but relational invariance: differences that influence future behaviour by reshaping what transitions remain possible. Computation is identified with the ongoing enactment of such organisation, integrating memory, processing, and execution as inseparable aspects of material dynamics. Within this framework, algorithms correspond to internally embedded regularities enabled by constraint, and computational limits arise from organisation itself. The account provides experimentally accessible criteria for computation based on persistence, recovery, and structural failure under perturbation.</description>

      <title>Wattnet: matching electricity consumption with low-carbon, low-water footprint energy supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environmental impact of electricity consumption is commonly assessed through its carbon footprint (CF), while water-related impacts are often overlooked despite the strong interdependence between energy and water systems. This is particularly relevant for electricity-intensive activities such as data center (DC) operations, where both carbon emissions and water use occur largely off-site through electricity consumption. In this work, we present Wattnet, an open-source tool that jointly assesses the CF and water footprint (WF) of electricity consumption across Europe with high temporal resolution. Wattnet implements an electricity flow-tracing methodology that accounts for local generation mixes, as well as for cross-border electricity imports and exports at a 15-minute resolution. Operational and life-cycle impact factors are used to quantify and compare local (generation-based) and global (consumption-based) footprints for multiple European regions during 2024. The results demonstrate that neglecting electricity flows and temporal variability can lead to significant misestimations of both CF and WF, particularly in countries with high levels of electricity trade or hydropower dependence. Furthermore, the joint analysis reveals trade-offs between decarbonisation and water use, highlighting the prominent role of reservoir-based hydropower in increasing WF even in low-carbon systems. Wattnet facilitates informed decision-making for workload scheduling and energy-aware operation of DCs, while also enhancing transparency regarding the environmental impacts of electricity consumption for end users and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Structure of Pitch-Pattern Motifs in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baseball consists of two teams alternating between batting and fielding while competing to score runs through sequential pitching events. Recent advances in tracking technology have enabled all Major League Baseball (MLB) clubs to record every pitch with high resolution, yet most quantitative studies have primarily emphasized single-pitch metrics, leaving the role of sequential structure less explored. Here, we examine pitch-pattern motifs of multiple lengths using approximately 12.4 million Statcast pitch recordings from the 2008-2025 MLB regular seasons at two complementary scales. At the macroscale, we quantify pitch-sequence diversity using the Shannon entropy and inverse Simpson index and examine their relationships with earned run average and win totals. At the microscale, we compare hit and out frequencies across pitch-pattern motifs. Rather than identifying outcome-determining sequences, we find that motif usage exhibits stable, non-random organization, as reflected in Zipf s and Heaps' laws, while showing limited association with conventional performance measures. While language-like scaling (Zipf's and Heaps' laws) clearly reveals an underlying 'grammar' of MLB pitch sequences, that grammar alone is insufficient to account for performance indicators such as ERA or wins. These results suggest that sequence-based analyses clarify the structural organization of pitch usage, while also delineating the limits of motif-based approaches for explaining performance without richer contextual information.</description>

      <title>Observing rurality of a geographical area from road graph geometry -- a qualitative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the Finnish road network as a graph in order to measure whether the "rurality" or "urbanity" of an area correlates with local geometrical properties of the graph. Our primary motivation is the observation that the road systems in rural areas look similar to hyperbolic graphs, while in large cities they resemble more the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We do not aim for a comprehensive analysis, but rather wish to demonstrate that this observation can be measured and analyzed through looking at various "hyperbolicity measures" of randomly sampled geodesic triangles in the road graph.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary vaccination dynamics under higher-order reinforcement pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccination games in higher-order settings remain underexplored, despite their importance in shaping opinions and collective decisions. Here, we introduce a parsimonious behavioral-epidemiological model to evaluate how peer reinforcement pressure influences vaccination uptake. The framework consists of a two-layer multiplex: an epidemic layer governed by the SIR process on a square lattice, and a behavioral layer represented by a hypergraph of triadic interactions. Individuals update their vaccination strategy via imitation, modulated by a reinforcement parameter $\alpha$ when peer support is present. We find that higher-order structure alone induces clusters of vaccinated individuals that act as protective barriers. Low but nonzero reinforcement ($\alpha \approx 0.5$) maximizes coverage and suppresses outbreaks, while both negligible ($\alpha \approx 0$) and moderate ($\alpha &gt; 0.1$) reinforcement reduce uptake, as excessive confirmation lowers adaptability and enables non-vaccinators to re-emerge. Our work bridges complex contagion theory with evolutionary game dynamics, offering insights into how contact structure and peer reinforcement jointly shape vaccination behavior.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic scaling and stochastic criticality in collective attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a universal scaling law governing the dispersion of collective attention and identify its underlying stochastic criticality. By analysing large-scale ensembles of Wikipedia page views, we find that the variance of logarithmic attention grows ultraslowly, $\operatorname{Var}[\ln{X(t)}]\propto\ln{t}$, in sharp contrast to the power-law scaling typically expected for diffusive processes. We show that this behaviour is captured by a minimal stochastic differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion, in which long-range memory ($H$) and temporal decay of volatility ($\eta$) enter through the single exponent $\xi\equiv H-\eta$. At marginality, $\xi=0$, the variance grows logarithmically, marking the critical boundary between power-law growth ($\xi&gt;0$) and saturation ($\xi&lt;0$). By incorporating article-level heterogeneity through a Gaussian mixture model, we further reconstruct the empirical distribution of cumulative attention within the same framework. Our results place collective attention in a distinct class of non-Markovian stochastic processes, with close affinity to ageing-like and ultraslow dynamics in glassy systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Structural Disparities in theWeb of Scientific Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific attention is unevenly distributed, creating inequities in recognition and distorting access to opportunities. Using citations as a proxy, we quantify disparities in attention by gender and institutional prestige. We find that women receive systematically fewer citations than men, and that attention is increasingly concentrated among authors from elite institutions -- patterns not fully explained by underrepresentation alone. To explain these dynamics, we introduce a model of citation network growth that incorporates homophily (tendency to cite similar authors), preferential attachment (favoring highly cited authors) and group size (underrepresentation). The model shows that disparities arise not only from group size imbalances but also from cumulative advantage amplifying biased citation preferences. Importantly, increasing representation alone is often insufficient to reduce disparities. Effective strategies should also include reducing homophily, amplifying the visibility of underrepresented groups, and supporting equitable integration of newcomers. Our findings highlight the challenges of mitigating inequities in asymmetric networks like citations, where recognition flows in one direction. By making visible the mechanisms through which attention is distributed, we contribute to efforts toward a more responsible web of science that is fairer, more transparent, and more inclusive, and that better sustains innovation and knowledge production.</description>

      <title>The Physics of the Dancing \emph{Deity}: Coupled Oscillators in Himalayan Processions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In parts of Himachal Pradesh (Kullu and Mandi) and the Western Himalaya, village deities (\emph{devt\=a}) are carried through the landscape on shoulder-borne palanquins or ``raths.'' Participants often describe these raths as agents: they \emph{choose} routes, signal assent or refusal, and sometimes ``move on their own'' as if people are not moving them but are instead being moved. This paper offers : (i) a mechanistic model in which a palanquin interacts with human carriers modeled as coupled limit-cycle oscillators, and (ii) a philosophical analysis of how music and gurus/oracular specialists (\emph{g\=ur}/``guru'' in local English) function as couplings that stabilize collective interpretation, producing what we call \emph{distributed agency}. On the physics side we build a six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body model with unilateral handle contacts, base excitation from walking, and a Kuramoto-Adler phase description for interpersonal coupling and musical entrainment. We prove standard phase-locking conditions (Adler-type capture range) and show how unilateral contact can rectify periodic forcing and inject harmonics, creating parameter regimes in which near-perfect synchrony produces large-amplitude roll. On the simulation side we report an ensemble study (30 seeds per condition) from an archived ``Palanquin Simulator'' package: a ``baseline'' condition produces small roll (\(\mathrm{RMS}\approx 0.15^{\circ}\)) and moderate synchrony, whereas a ``music'' entrainment condition produces near-unity synchrony (\(\approx 0.99\)) but also robust roll instability (\(\mathrm{RMS}\approx 18^{\circ}\)) and frequent contact loss. We do \emph{not} claim to have validated the model against field data; we treat the simulations as a \emph{proof of plausibility} and as a generator of falsifiable predictions.</description>

      <title>Modelling viable supply networks with cooperative adaptive financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a financial liquidity policy sharing method for firm-to-firm supply networks, introducing a scalable autonomous control function for viable complex adaptive supply networks. Cooperation and competition in supply chains is reconciled through overlapping collaborative sets, making firms interdependent and enabling distributed risk governance. How cooperative range - visibility - affects viability is studied using dynamic complex adaptive systems modelling. We find that viability needs cooperation; visibility and viability grow together in scale-free supply networks; and distributed control, where firms only have limited partner information, outperforms centralised control. This suggests that policy toward network viability should implement distributed supply chain financial governance, supporting interfirm collaboration, to enable autonomous control.</description>

      <title>The Collapse of Multilayer Predation and the Emergence of a Monolithic Leviathan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a multilayer recursive game model to demonstrate that in a rule vacuum environment, hierarchical predatory structures inevitably collapse into a monolithic political strongman system due to the conflict between exponentially growing rent dissipation and the rigidity of bottom-level survival constraints. We propose that the rise of a monolithic political strongman is essentially an "algorithmic entropy reduction" achieved through forceful means by the system to counteract the "informational entropy increase" generated by multilayer agency. However, the order gained at the expense of social complexity results in the stagnation of social evolutionary functions.</description>

      <title>The mechanistic origin of branching-driven nucleation in abrupt phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are the macroscopic manifestation of microscopic processes that drive a system towards a new state. The detailed evolution of these processes, particularly in abrupt phase transitions, are currently not fully understood. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework based on internal node dependencies within a single-layer lattice. Crucially, we demonstrate that the fundamental mechanism underlying abrupt transitions is nucleation propagation preceded by a slow cascading process which scales with the range of dependencies. Our findings show that the synergy between these two distinct stages is essential for the occurrence of an abrupt transition. The first stage of a slow cascading mechanism was recently observed experimentally in superconducting layered materials, where heat acts as the dependency links, for the limit of infinite dependency range. Our model thus generalizes the framework to include finite dependency ranges, revealing previously unobserved mechanisms that could be experimentally verified through controlling the range of thermal diffusion in the material. As a universal mechanism, our model provides a robust method to test nucleation-controlled phase transitions in multiple systems, providing a path to discover and understand microscopic mechanisms in phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Block-Fitness Modeling of the Global Air Mobility Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate representations of the World Air Transportation Network (WAN) are fundamental inputs to models of global mobility, epidemic risk, and infrastructure planning. However, high-resolution, real-time data on the WAN are largely commercial and proprietary, therefore often inaccessible to the research community. Here we introduce a generative model of the WAN that treats air travel as a stochastic process within a maximum-entropy framework. The model uses airport-level passenger flows to probabilistically generate connections while preserving traffic volumes across geographic regions. The resulting reconstructed networks reproduce key structural properties of the WAN and enable simulations of dynamic spreading that closely match those obtained using the real network. Our approach provides a scalable, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for forecasting and policy design in global mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Generating consensus and dissent on massive discussion platforms with an $O(N)$ semantic-vector model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reaching consensus on massive discussion networks is critical for reducing noise and achieving optimal collective outcomes. However, the natural tendency of humans to preserve their initial ideas constrains the emergence of global solutions. To address this, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms facilitate the discovery of globally superior solutions. We introduce a dynamical system based on the standard $O(N)$ model to drive the aggregation of semantically similar ideas. The system consists of users represented as nodes in a $d=2$ lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions, where their ideas are represented by semantic vectors computed with a pretrained embedding model. We analyze the system's equilibrium states as a function of the coupling parameter $\beta$. Our results show that $\beta &gt; 0$ drives the system toward a ferromagnetic-like phase (global consensus), while $\beta &lt; 0$ induces an antiferromagnetic-like state (maximum dissent), where users maximize semantic distance from their neighbors. This framework offers a controllable method for managing the tradeoff between cohesion and diversity in CI platforms.</description>

      <title>Economic complexity and regional development in India: Insights from a state-industry bipartite network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic complexity of Indian states by constructing a state-industry bipartite network using firm-level data on registered companies and their paid-up capital. We compute the Economic Complexity Index and apply the fitness-complexity algorithm to quantify the diversity and sophistication of productive capabilities across the Indian states and two union territories. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity in regional capability structures, with states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi exhibiting consistently high complexity, while others remain concentrated in ubiquitous, low-value industries. The analysis also shows a strong positive relationship between complexity metrics and per-capita Gross State Domestic Product, underscoring the role of capability accumulation in shaping economic performance. Additionally, the number of active firms in India demonstrates a persistent exponential growth at an annual rate of 11.2%, reflecting ongoing formalization and industrial expansion. The ordered binary matrix displays the characteristic triangular structure observed in complexity studies, validating the applicability of complexity frameworks at the sub-national level. This work highlights the usefulness of firm-based data for assessing regional productive structures and emphasizes the importance of capability-oriented strategies for fostering balanced and sustainable development across Indian states. By demonstrating the usefulness of firm registry data in data constrained environments, this study advances the empirical application of economic complexity methods and provides a quantitative foundation for capability-oriented industrial and regional policy in India.</description>

      <title>Scientific production in the era of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13187</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping scientific research. We analyze these changes in multiple, large-scale datasets with 2.1M preprints, 28K peer review reports, and 246M online accesses to scientific documents. We find: 1) scientists adopting LLMs to draft manuscripts demonstrate a large increase in paper production, ranging from 23.7-89.3% depending on scientific field and author background, 2) LLM use has reversed the relationship between writing complexity and paper quality, leading to an influx of manuscripts that are linguistically complex but substantively underwhelming, and 3) LLM adopters access and cite more diverse prior work, including books and younger, less-cited documents. These findings highlight a stunning shift in scientific production that will likely require a change in how journals, funding agencies, and tenure committees evaluate scientific works.</description>

      <title>TRGCN: A Hybrid Framework for Social Network Rumor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient rumor detection is critical for information governance, particularly in the context of the rapid spread of misinformation on social networks. Traditional rumor detection relied primarily on manual analysis. With the continuous advancement of technology, machine learning and deep learning approaches for rumor identification have gradually emerged and gained prominence. However, previous approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture both the sequential and the global structural relationships among topological nodes within a social network. To tackle this issue, we introduce a hybrid model for detecting rumors that integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a Transformer architecture, aiming to leverage the complementary strengths of structural and semantic feature extraction. Positional encoding helps preserve the sequential order of these nodes within the propagation structure. The use of Multi-head attention mechanisms enables the model to capture features across diverse representational subspaces, thereby enhancing both the richness and depth of text comprehension. This integration allows the framework to concurrently identify the key propagation network of rumors, the textual content, the long-range dependencies, and the sequence among propagation nodes. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets, including Twitter 15 and Twitter 16, demonstrate that our proposed fusion model significantly outperforms both standalone models and existing mainstream methods in terms of accuracy. These results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach for the rumor detection task.</description>

      <title>Global evidence for a consistent spatial footprint of intra-urban centers</title>

Abstract: Urban space is highly heterogeneous, with population and human activities concentrating in localized centers. However, the global organization of such intra-urban centers remains poorly understood due to the lack of consistent, comparable data. Here we develop a scalable geospatial framework to identify intra-urban activity centers worldwide using nighttime light observations. Applying this approach to more than 9,500 cities, we construct a high-resolution global dataset of over 15,000 centers. We uncover a striking regularity: despite vast differences in city size, regional development, and population density, the built-up area associated with individual centers remains remarkably consistent. Across cities, total urban area scales proportionally with the number of centers, yielding a stable mean spatial footprint. This regularity holds at the micro-scale, where Voronoi-based service areas exhibit a characteristic size that is persistent across countries and independent of local population concentration. As a geometric consequence, this polycentric multiplication maintains stable average distances to the nearest center as cities expand, preventing the accessibility decay inherent in monocentric growth. These findings reveal a universal organizing principle whereby urban expansion is accommodated through the replication of activity centers with a consistent spatial extent, providing a new empirical foundation for understanding the nature of urban growth.</description>

      <title>Beyond MMD: Evaluating Graph Generative Models with Geometric Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.</description>
