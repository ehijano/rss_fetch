      <title>Excitable dynamics and coral reef formation: A simple model of macro-scale structure development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that key aspects of the dynamical behavior of coral reefs at the macro scale, which evolve over time scales of centuries, can be accurately described using a model that integrates a few fundamental ecological and physical mechanisms. The model displays excitable behavior generating, among other dynamical regimes, traveling pulses and waves, which result in the formation of spatial structures resembling those observed in real reefs, without involving a classical pattern formation mechanism, like the Turing scenario. We conduct an in-depth exploration of the bifurcations exhibited by the model as a function of the two most ecologically significant parameters. This establishes the groundwork for using the presented model as a tool to explain coral reef formation.</description>

      <title>The Pfaffian Structure of CFN Phylogenetic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic techniques in phylogenetics have historically been successful at proving identifiability results and have also led to novel reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we study the ideal of phylogenetic invariants of the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model on a phylogenetic network with the goal of providing a description of the invariants which is useful for network inference. It was previously shown that to characterize the invariants of any level-1 network, it suffices to understand all sunlet networks, which are those consisting of a single cycle with a leaf adjacent to each cycle vertex. We show that the parameterization of an affine open patch of the CFN sunlet model, which intersects the probability simplex factors through the space of skew-symmetric matrices via Pfaffians. We then show that this affine patch is isomorphic to a determinantal variety and give an explicit Gr{\"o}bner basis for the associated ideal, which involves only polynomially many coordinates. Lastly, we show that sunlet networks with at least 6 leaves are identifiable using only these polynomials and run extensive simulations, which show that these polynomials can be used to accurately infer the correct network from DNA sequence data.</description>

      <title>Inferring resource competition in microbial communities from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition for resources is a defining feature of microbial communities. In many contexts, from soils to host-associated communities, highly diverse microbes are organized into metabolic groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. The resource preferences of individual taxa that give rise to these guilds are critical for understanding fluxes of resources through the community and the structure of diversity in the system. However, inferring the metabolic capabilities of individual taxa, and their competition with other taxa, within a community is challenging and unresolved. Here we address this gap in knowledge by leveraging dynamic measurements of abundances in communities. We show that simple correlations are often misleading in predicting resource competition. We show that spectral methods such as the cross-power spectral density (CPSD) and coherence that account for time-delayed effects are superior metrics for inferring the structure of resource competition in communities. We first demonstrate this fact on synthetic data generated from consumer-resource models with time-dependent resource availability, where taxa are organized into groups or guilds with similar resource preferences. By applying spectral methods to oceanic plankton time-series data, we demonstrate that these methods detect interaction structures among species with similar genomic sequences. Our results indicate that analyzing temporal data across multiple timescales can reveal the underlying structure of resource competition within communities.</description>
