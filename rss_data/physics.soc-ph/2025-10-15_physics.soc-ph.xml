      <title>The Price-Pareto growth model of networks with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework for modelling degree sequences in individual communities of real-world networks, e.g., citations to papers in different fields. Our work is inspired by Price's model and its recent generalisation called 3DSI (three dimensions of scientific impact), which assumes that citations are gained partly accidentally, and to some extent preferentially. Our generalisation is motivated by existing research indicating significant differences between how various scientific disciplines grow, namely, minding different growth ratios, average reference list lengths, and preferential citing tendencies. Extending the 3DSI model to heterogeneous networks with a community structure allows us to devise new analytical formulas for, e.g., citation number inequality and preferentiality measures. We show that the distribution of citations in a community tends to a Pareto type II distribution. We also present analytical formulas for estimating its parameters and Gini's index. The new model is validated on real citation networks.</description>

      <title>Trajectory-based real-time pedestrian crash prediction at intersections: A novel non-linear link function for block maxima led Bayesian GEV framework addressing heterogeneous traffic condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study develops a real-time framework for estimating pedestrian crash risk at signalized intersections under heterogeneous, non-lane-based traffic. Existing approaches often assume linear relationships between covariates and parameters, oversimplifying the complex, non-monotonic interactions among different road users. To overcome this, the framework introduces a non-linear link function within a Bayesian generalized extreme value (GEV) structure to capture traffic variability more accurately. The framework applies extreme value theory through the block maxima approach using post-encroachment time as a surrogate safety measure. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating both linear and non-linear link functions into GEV parameters is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. It also introduces a behavior-normalized Modified Crash Risk (MRC) formula to account for pedestrians' habitual risk-taking behavior. Seven Bayesian hierarchical models were developed and compared using deviance information criterion. Models employing non-linear link functions for the location and scale parameters significantly outperformed their linear counterparts. The results revealed that pedestrian speed has a negative relationship with crash risk, while flow and speed of motorized vehicles, pedestrian flow, and non-motorized vehicles conflicting speed contribute positively. The MRC formulation reduced overestimation and provided crash predictions with 93% confidence. The integration of non-linear link functions enhances model flexibility, capturing the non-linear nature of traffic extremes. The proposed MRC metric aligns crash risk estimates with real-world pedestrian behavior in mixed-traffic environments. This framework offers a practical analytical tool for traffic engineers and planners to design adaptive signal control and pedestrian safety interventions before crashes occur.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Assessing Inclusivity and Empowerment of People for Supporting the Design of Inclusive Product Lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of an inclusive product lifecycle is important for empowering stakeholders through their meaningful inclusion in lifecycle processes. To achieve this, the inclusion of stakeholders must be structured in a way that supports their empowerment. Inclusivity addresses the lifecycle context to improve how diverse stakeholders are included across phases, supporting their empowerment. This study aims to build on current inclusive design approaches, which often focus on empowering users through the use of products. It proposes inclusive lifecycle processes as a way to empower a wider range of stakeholders for sustainable development. We apply a novel framework to real-life case studies from the literature to identify the dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity. By analysing the relationships between these dimensions, we propose specific metrics that show strong causal connections. These metrics allow measurable outcomes to support the fair development of stakeholders. Measuring inclusivity and empowerment can serve as a foundation for supporting sustainability, dignity, well-being, and fair stakeholder development, which are explored further in Part 2 and Part 3 of this study. This study contributes to design science by expanding the understanding of inclusive design through stakeholder inclusion in lifecycle phases and by shifting the focus from product to process design.</description>

      <title>The Untapped Potential of Smart Charging: How EV Owners Can Save Money and Reduce Emissions Without Behavioral Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transportation sector is the single largest contributor to US emissions and the second largest globally. Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to represent half of global car sales by 2035, emerging as a pivotal solution to reduce emissions and enhance grid flexibility. The electrification of buildings, manufacturing, and transportation is expected to grow electricity demand substantially over the next decade. Without effectively managed EV charging, EVs could strain energy grid infrastructure and increase electricity costs. Drawing on de-identified 2023 EV telematics data from Rivian Automotive, this study found that 72% of home charging commenced after the customer plugged in their vehicle regardless of utility time of use (TOU) tariffs or managed charging programs. In fewer than 26% of charging sessions in the sample, EV owners actively scheduled charging times to align or participate in utility tariffs or programs. With a majority of drivers concurrently plugged in during optimal charging periods yet not actively charging, the study identified an opportunity to reduce individual EV owner costs and carbon emissions through smarter charging habits without significant behavioral modifications or sacrifice in user preferences. By optimizing home charging schedules within existing plug-in and plug-out windows, the study suggests that EV owners can save an average of $140 annually and reduce the associated carbon emissions of charging their EV by as much as 28%.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems that coordinate multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have a much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>
