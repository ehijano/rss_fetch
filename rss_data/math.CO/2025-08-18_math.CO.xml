      <title>On 2-Movable Total Domination in the Join and Corona of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph. A non-empty $T\subseteq V(G)$ is a $2$-\textit{movable total dominating set} of $G$ if $T$ is a total dominating set and for every pair $x,y \in T$, $T \backslash \{x, y\}$ is a total dominating set in $G$, or there exist $u, v \in V(G) \backslash T$ such that $u$ and $v$ are adjacent to $x$ and $y$, respectively, and $(T \backslash \{x,y\}) \cup \{u,v\}$ is a total dominating set in $G$. The $2$-\textit{movable total domination number} of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{mt}^{2}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a 2-movable total dominating set of $G$. A 2-movable total dominating set with cardinality equal to $\gamma_{mt}^{2}(G)$ is called $\gamma_{mt}^{2}$-set of $G$. This paper present the 2-movable total domination in the join and corona of graphs.</description>

      <title>Promotion digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work of Gaetz, Pechenik, Pfannerer, Striker, and Swanson (2024) introduced promotion permutations for a rectangular standard Young tableau $T$. These promotion permutations encode important features of $T$ and its orbit under Sch\"utzenberger's promotion operator. Indeed, the promotion permutations uniquely determine the tableau $T$.
  We introduce more general promotion digraphs for both standard and increasing tableaux of arbitrary shape. For rectangular standard tableaux, this construction recovers the functional digraphs of the promotion permutations. Among other facts, we show that promotion digraphs uniquely determine $T$ when $T$ is standard of arbitrary shape or increasing of rectangular shape, but not when $T$ is increasing and general shape. We completely characterize the promotion digraphs for two-row rectangular increasing tableaux. We use promotion digraphs for three-row rectangular increasing tableaux to conjecture a connection between their dynamics and the flamingo webs recently introduced by Kim to give a diagrammatic basis of the Specht module $S^{(k^3,1^{n-3k})}$.</description>

      <title>Total b-chromatic Colouring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A b-chromatic colouring of a graph $G$ is a proper $k$-colouring of the vertices of $G$, for some integer $k$, such that, for each colour $i$ ($1\leq i\leq k$), there exists a vertex $v$ of colour $i$ such that $v$ is adjacent to a vertex of colour $j$, for each $j$ ($1\leq j\leq k$, $j\neq i$). The b-chromatic number of $G$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a b-chromatic colouring using $k$ colours. In this paper we introduce the concept of a total b-chromatic colouring, which extends the notion of b-chromatic colourings to both vertices and edges in a graph. We show that the problem of computing the total b-chromatic number is NP-hard in general graphs. On the other hand for a subclass of caterpillars we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the total b-chromatic number, and indeed a total b-chromatic colouring with the maximum number of colours.</description>

      <title>Perfect codes in Cayley graphs of Haj\'os groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect code in a graph $\Gamma$ is a subset $C$ of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ such that every vertex of $\Gamma$ outside $C$ has exactly one neighbour in $C$. A perfect code in a directed graph can be defined similarly by requiring that for every vertex $v$ outside $C$ there exists exactly one vertex $u$ in $C$ such that the arc from $u$ to $v$ exists in $\Gamma$. A subset $X$ of an abelian group $G$ is said to be periodic if there exists a non-identity element $g$ of $G$ such that $g + X = X$. A factorization of $G$ is a pair of nonempty subsets $(A, B)$ of $G$ such that every element $g$ of $G$ can be expressed uniquely as $g = a+b$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. If for every factorization $(A, B)$ of an abelian group $G$ at least one of $A$ and $B$ is periodic, then $G$ is said to be a Haj\'os group. In this paper we classify all Cayley graphs (directed or undirected) of Haj\'os groups which admit perfect codes, and moreover we determine all perfect codes in such Cayley graphs.</description>

      <title>On the $PGL_2(q)$-orbits of lines of $PG(3,q)$ and binary quartic forms in characteristic three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of classifying the lines of the projective $3$-space $PG(3,q)$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ into orbits of the group $PGL_2(q)$ of linear symmetries of the twisted cubic $C$. The problem has been solved in literature in characteristic different from $3$, and in this work, we solve the problem in characteristic $3$. We reduce this problem to another problem, which is the classification of binary quartic forms into $PGL_2(q)$-orbits. We first solve the latter problem and use to solve the former problem. We also obtain the point-line and the line-plane incidence structures of the point, line, and plane orbits.</description>

      <title>On the foundations of signed graphs I: chain groups, frame matroid, and bivariate flow polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies signed graphs with possible outer-edges. We introduce and investigate the chain group, the boundary operator, the co-boundary operator, the flow group, the tension group, the homology group, the cohomology group, with coefficients in an abelian group. We also introduce and investigate the bivariate flow polynomial for signed graphs. The guiding principle is the correspondence between representable matroids over $\mathbb{R}$ on a ground set $E$ of edges and the subspaces of the vector space of real-valued chains on the same ground set. The frame matroid of signed graph emerges naturally by defining circuits as minimal supports of nonzero flows, rather than listing circuit patterns abruptly. Likewise, bonds, or co-circuits, can be obtained as minimal supports of nonzero tensions. In addition to standardizing the concepts and their meanings of signed graphs, we update the following results: (1) Characterization of cuts and bonds of signed graph with outer-edges. (2) The structures of flow group, boundary group, and homology group, with coefficients in an arbitrary abelian group. (3) Introduction of bivariate flow polynomial of signed graph, revealing the mystery of inexistence of univariate flow polynomial of signed graph in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spanning path-cycle systems with given end-vertices in regular graphs (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following theorem. Let $r\ge 4$ be an integer, and $G$ be a $K_{1,r}$-free $r$-edge-connected $r$-regular graph. Then, for every set $W$ of even number of vertices of $G$ such that the distance between any two vertices of $W$ in $G$ is at least 3, $G$ has vertex-disjoint paths and cycles $P_1, \ldots, P_m, C_1, \ldots, C_n$ such that (i) $V(G)=V(P_1) \cup \cdots \cup V(P_m) \cup V(C_1) \cup \cdots \cup V(C_n)$, (ii) each path $P_i$ connects two vertices of $W$, and (iii) the set of the end-vertices of $P_i$'s is equal to $W$. A similar result for a 3-regular graph is obtained in [Graphs Combin. {\bf 39} (2023) \#85]. However, our proof is widely different from its proof.</description>

      <title>Embedding Graphs of Simple Treewidth into Sparse Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study embeddings of graphs with bounded treewidth or bounded simple treewidth into the undirected graph underlying the directed product of two directed graphs. If the factors have bounded maximum indegrees, then the product graph has bounded maximum indegree and therefore is sparse. We prove that every graph of simple treewidth $k$ is contained in (ignoring edge directions) the directed product of directed graphs $\vec H_1$ and $\vec H_2$, with $\Delta^-(\vec H_1), \Delta^-(\vec H_2) \leq k-1 $ and $\text{tw}(H_1), \text{tw}(H_2) \leq k-1$. Further, we show that this treewidth bound is best possible. Several corollaries follow from our results: every outerplanar graph is contained in the directed product of trees with maximum indegree $1$, and every planar graph with treewidth $3$ is contained in a directed product of graphs with treewidth $2$ and maximum indegree $2$. However, for graphs of treewidth $k$, we prove a negative result: for any integers $s, t, k \geq 1$, there is a graph $G$ with treewidth $k$ not contained in the directed product of $\vec H_1$ and $\vec H_2$ for any directed graphs $\vec H_1$ and $\vec H_2$ with $\Delta^-(\vec H_1) \leq s$, $\Delta^-(\vec H_2) \leq t$, and $\text{tw}(H_1), \text{tw}(H_2) \leq k-1$. This result stands in stark contrast to the strong product case, where Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333] proved that the optimal lower bound on the factors is about half the treewidth.</description>

Abstract: We prove a new characterization of the Ramsey property of categories in terms of a generalized form of K\H{o}nig's tree lemma. Afterwards, we discuss its applications to structural Ramsey theory. In particular, we provide a new proof of the existence and uniqueness of minimal Ramsey expansions and a new transfer theorem which uses Grothendieck opfibrations and unifies several known Ramsey transfers.</description>

Abstract: An elegant bootstrap percolation result on the hyperrectangle graph was proved by Balogh, Bollob\'as, Morris, and Riordan using a linear algebric method in 2012. This paper studies the same problem by purely combinatorial means. The base case is solved for all dimensions, and we pose open problems for the remaining cases.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Induced-Universal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a series of new lower bounds on the minimum number of vertices required by a graph to contain every graph of a given family as induced subgraph. In particular, we show that this induced-universal graph for $n$-vertex planar graphs must have at least $10.52n$ vertices. We also show that the number of conflicting graphs to consider in order to beat this lower bound is at least $137$. In other words, any family of less than $137$ planar graphs of $n$ vertices has an induced-universal graph with less than $10.52n$ vertices, stressing the difficulty in beating such lower bounds. Similar results are developed for other graph families, including but not limited to, trees, outerplanar graphs, series-parallel graphs, $K_{3,3}$-minor free graphs. As a byproduct, we show that any family of $t$ graphs of $n$ vertices having small chromatic number and sublinear pathwidth, like any proper minor-closed family, has an induced-universal graph with less than $\frac{15}{7} \sqrt{t} \cdot n$ vertices. This is achieved by making a bridge between equitable colorings, combinatorial designs, and path-decompositions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a q-exponential generating function for inversions on parking functions via symmetric function theory and also through a direct bijection to rooted labeled forests. We then apply these techniques to unit interval parking functions to give analogous results. We conclude by introducing a probabilistic approach through which we obtain formulas for the total number of inversions and several other statistics across all parking functions and other sets of words closed under rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Sampling tree-weighted partitions without sampling trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a new algorithm for sampling tree-weighted partitions of a large class of planar graphs. Formally, the tree-weighted distribution on $k$-partitions of a graph weights $k$-partitions proportional to the product of the number of spanning trees of each partition class. Recent work on problems in computational redistricting analysis has driven special interest in the conditional distribution where all partition classes have the same size (balanced partitions). One class of Markov chains in wide use aims to sample from balanced tree-weighted $k$-partitions using a sampler for balanced tree-weighted 2-partitions. Previous implementations of this 2-partition sampler would draw a random spanning tree and check whether it contains an edge whose removal produces a balanced 2-component forest; if it does, this 2-partition is accepted, otherwise the algorithm rejects and repeats. In practice, this is a significant computational bottleneck.
  We show that in fact it is possible to sample from the balanced tree-weighted 2-partition distribution directly, without first sampling a spanning tree; the acceptance and rejection rates are the same as in previous samplers. We prove that on a wide class of planar graphs encompassing network structures typically arising from the geographic data used in computational redistricting, our algorithm takes expected linear time $O(n)$. Notably, this is asymptotically faster than the best known method to generate random trees, which is $O(n \log^2 n)$ for approximate sampling and $O(n^{1 + \log \log \log n / \log \log n})$ for exact sampling. Additionally, we show that a variant of our algorithm also gives a speedup to $O(n \log n)$ for exact sampling of uniformly random trees on these families of graphs, improving the bounds for both exact and approximate sampling.</description>

      <title>Face-hitting dominating sets in planar graphs: Alternative proof and linear-time algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Francis, Illickan, Jose and Rajendraprasad showed that every $n$-vertex plane graph $G$ has (under some natural restrictions) a vertex-partition into two sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that each $V_i$ is \emph{dominating} (every vertex of $G$ contains a vertex of $V_i$ in its closed neighbourhood) and \emph{face-hitting} (every face of $G$ is incident to a vertex of $V_i$). Their proof works by considering a supergraph $G'$ of $G$ that has certain properties, and among all such graphs, taking one that has the fewest edges. As such, their proof is not algorithmic. Their proof also relies on the 4-color theorem, for which a quadratic-time algorithm exists, but it would not be easy to implement.
  In this paper, we give a new proof that every $n$-vertex plane graph $G$ has (under the same restrictions) a vertex-partition into two dominating face-hitting sets. Our proof is constructive, and requires nothing more complicated than splitting a graph into 2-connected components, finding an ear decomposition, and computing a perfect matching in a 3-regular plane graph. For all these problems, linear-time algorithms are known and so we can find the vertex-partition in linear time.</description>

Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). We also give a generalization to equidimensional unions of matrix Schubert varieties. This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <title>Exact values and improved bounds on the clique number of cyclotomic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13213v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</description>

      <title>Proof of a $K$-theoretic polynomial conjecture of Monical, Pechenik, and Searles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of a program to develop $K$-theoretic analogues of combinatorially important polynomials, Monical, Pechenik, and Searles (2021) proved two expansion formulas $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a = \sum_b Q_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_b$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a = \sum_b M_b^a(\beta)\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_b,$ where each of $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ is a family of polynomials that forms a basis for $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n][\beta]$ indexed by weak compositions $a,$ and $Q_b^a(\beta)$ and $M_b^a(\beta)$ are monomials in $\beta$ for each pair $(a,b)$ of weak compositions. The polynomials $\overline{\mathfrak{A}}_a$ are the Lascoux atoms, $\overline{\mathfrak{P}}_a$ are the kaons, $\overline{\mathfrak{Q}}_a$ are the quasiLascoux polynomials, and $\overline{\mathfrak{F}}_a$ are the glide polynomials; these are respectively the $K$-analogues of the Demazure atoms $\mathfrak{A}_a$, the fundamental particles $\mathfrak{P}_a$, the quasikey polynomials $\mathfrak{Q}_a$, and the fundamental slide polynomials $\mathfrak{F}_a$. Monical, Pechenik, and Searles conjectured that for any fixed $a,$ $\sum_b Q_b^a(-1), \sum_b M_b^a(-1) \in \{0,1\},$ where $b$ ranges over all weak compositions. We prove this conjecture using a sign-reversing involution.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of caterpillar tanglegrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tanglegram consists of two rooted binary trees with the same number of leaves and a perfect matching between the leaves of the trees. Given a size-$n$ tanglegram, i.e., a tanglegram for two trees with $n$ leaves, a multiset of induced size-$(n-1)$ tanglegrams is obtained by deleting a pair of matched leaves in every possible way. Here, we analyze whether a size-$n$ tanglegram is uniquely encoded by this multiset of size-$(n-1)$ tanglegrams. We answer this question affirmatively in the case that at least one of the two trees of the tanglegram is a caterpillar tree.</description>

      <title>An exact closed walks series formula for the complexity of regular graphs and some related bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity of a graph is the number of its labeled spanning trees. In this work complexity is studied in settings that admit regular graphs. An exact formula is established linking complexity of the complement of a regular graph to numbers of closed walks in the graph by way of an infinite alternating series. Some consequences of this result yield infinite classes of lower and upper bounds on the complexity of such graphs. Applications of these mathematical results to biological problems on neuronal activity are described.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-type problems for tilings in dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, the Ramsey number $R(H)$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that every $2$-edge-colouring of $K_n$ yields a monochromatic copy of $H$. We write $mH$ to denote the union of $m$ vertex-disjoint copies of $H$. The members of the family $\{mH:m\ge1\}$ are also known as $H$-tilings. A well-known result of Burr, Erd\H{o}s and Spencer states that $R(mK_3)=5m$ for every $m\ge2$. On the other hand, Moon proved that every $2$-edge-colouring of $K_{3m+2}$ yields a $K_3$-tiling consisting of $m$ monochromatic copies of $K_3$, for every $m\ge2$. Crucially, in Moon's result, distinct copies of $K_3$ might receive different colours.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous questions where the complete host graph is replaced by a graph of large minimum degree. We determine the (asymptotic) minimum degree threshold for forcing a~$K_3$-tiling covering a prescribed proportion of the vertices in a $2$-edge-coloured graph such that every copy of $K_3$ in the tiling is monochromatic. We also determine the largest size of a monochromatic $K_3$-tiling one can guarantee in any $2$-edge-coloured graph of large minimum degree. These results therefore provide generalisations of the theorems of Moon and Burr-Erd\H{o}s-Spencer to the setting of dense graphs.
  It is also natural to consider generalisations of these problems to $r$-edge-colourings (for $r \geq 2$) and for $H$-tilings (for arbitrary graphs $H$). We prove some results in this direction and propose several open questions.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for Ramsey numbers of bounded degree hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that, for all $k \ge 3,$ and any integers $\Delta, n$ with $n \ge \Delta,$ there exists a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ whose $4$-color Ramsey number is at least $\mathrm{tw}_k(c_k \Delta) \cdot n$, for some constant $c_k &gt; 0$, where $\mathrm{tw}_k$ denotes the tower function. For $k \ge 4,$ this is tight up to the constant $c_k$ and for $k = 3$ it is known to be tight up to a factor of $\log \Delta$ on top of the tower. It extends a well-known result of Graham, R\"{o}dl and Ruci\'{n}ski for graphs and answers a question of Conlon, Fox and Sudakov from 2008.</description>

      <title>Maximizing subgraph density in graphs of bounded degree and clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We asymptotically determine the maximum density of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$, where $H$ is any graph containing a dominating vertex, in graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices with bounded maximum degree and bounded clique number. That is, we asymptotically determine the constant $c=c(H,\Delta,\omega)$ such that ex$(n,H,\{K_{1,\Delta+1},K_{\omega+1}\})=(1-o_n(1))cn$ where $\omega$ is sufficiently large.
  Following recent interest in the corresponding parameter mex$(m,H,F)$ where where we fix the number of edges $m$ instead of the number of vertices $n$ of the graph, we determine the asymptotics of mex$(m,H,\{K_{1,1,\Delta+1},K_{\omega+1}\})$ when $H$ has at least two dominating vertices.
  We obtain these results via a uniform proof of a common technical generalization of both, where we fix the number of $u$-cliques in the graph. This general result may be of independent interest.
  Then we localize these results, proving a tight inequality involving the sizes of the locally largest cliques and complete split graphs.</description>

      <title>Words with factor complexity $2n+1$ and minimal critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Word ${\mathbf G}$ is the fixed point of the morphism $\gamma=[01,2,02]$. In 2019, Shallit and Shur showed that ${\mathbf G}$ has factor complexity $2n+1$. They also showed that ${\mathbf G}$ has critical exponent $\mu=2+\frac{1}{\lambda^2-1}= 2.4808726\cdots$, where $\lambda=1.7548777$ is the real zero of $x^3-2x+x-1=0$. They conjectured that this was the least possible critical exponent among words with factor complexity $2n+1$. We confirm their conjecture. The proof, using an intricate case analysis, is by computer. The relevant program generates a `human readable' proof.</description>

      <title>On the average stopping time of the Collatz map in $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Define the map $T_1$ on $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$ by $T_1(f)=\frac{f}{x}$ if $f(0)=0$ and $T_1(f)=\frac{(x+1)f+1}{x}$ if $f(0)=1$. For a non-zero polynomial $f$ let $\tau_1(f)$ denote the least natural $k$ number for which $T_1^{k}(f)=1$. Define the average stopping time to be $\rho_1(n)=\frac{\sum_{f\in \mathbb{F}_2[x], \text{deg}(f)=n }\tau_1(f)}{2^n}$. We show that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\rho_1(n)}{n}=2$, confirming a conjecture of Alon, Behajaina, and Paran. Furthermore, we give a new proof that $\tau_1(f)\in O(\text{deg}(f)^{1.5})$ for all $f\in\mathbb{F}_2[x]\setminus\{0\}$.</description>
