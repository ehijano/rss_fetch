      <title>Single-event neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy with a petawatt-laser-driven neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast neutron-induced nuclear reactions are crucial for advancing our understanding of fundamental nuclear processes, stellar nucleosynthesis, and applications, including reactor safety, medical isotope production, and materials research. With many research reactors being phased out, compact accelerator-based neutron sources are becoming increasingly important. Laser-driven neutron sources (LDNSs) offer unique advantages -- ultrashort neutron pulsees for superior energy resolution, high per-pulse flux, and a drastically reduced footprint. However, their use in single-event fast neutron spectroscopy remains unproven, requiring stable multi-shot operation and detectors capable of functioning in the extreme environment of petawatt-class laser-plasma interactions. Here, we present a proof-of-concept experiment at the DRACO~PW laser in a pitcher-catcher configuration, stably producing 6-7e7 neutrons/shot with energies above 1 MeV, over more than 200 shots delivered at a shot-per-minute rate. Neutron time-of-flight measurements were performed using a single-crystal diamond detector, which is located only 1.5 m away from the source and capable of resolving individual neutron-induced reactions. Observed reaction rates are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations inferred by real-time diagnostics of accompanying gamma, ion, and electron fluxes. With the recent advances in repetition rate, targetry, and ion acceleration efficiency, this work establishes LDNSs as a promising, scalable platform for future fast neutron-induced reaction studies, particularly for measurements involving short-lived isotopes or requiring high instantaneous neutron flux.</description>

      <title>Aluminium fast neutron leakage spectrum validation</title>

Abstract: Aluminum is a crucial material in the nuclear industry, valued for its ability to perform reliably over time. The manuscript focuses on validating aluminum neutron transport libraries. The validation was conducted by activating samples in different positions, and measuring the fast neutron spectrum in the energy range of 0.1 MeV to 1.3 MeV by means of a proportional detector filled with hydrogen and, in the energy range of 1-12 MeV using a scintillation stilbene detector. Validation experiments were performed on the aluminium block with a central hole which was assembled from smaller aluminum plates. The dosimetric reactions studied for validation purposes were 58Ni(n,p)58Co, 197Au(n,g)198Au, 63Cu(n,g)64Cu, 181Ta(n,g)182Ta, 92Mo(n,p)92mNb, natTi(n,X)46Sc, and natTi(n,X)47Sc. All experimental data were compared to MCNP6.2 simulations using the ENDF/B-VIII.0, JEFF-3.3, and JENDL-5 neutron transport libraries. Activation cross sections were taken from IRDFF-II library. Concerning activation reactions results, unsatisfactory results are achieved for 197Au(n,g)198Au reaction regardless of thickness and library. All other results are reasonable regardless on library. JEFF-3.3 and ENDF/B-VIII.0 fast neutron flux calculations are similar.</description>

      <title>Structure of odd-A Ag isotopes studied via algebraic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of the odd-$A$ silver isotopes $^{103-115}$Ag is discussed within the frame of the Interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM). An overview of their key properties is presented, with particular attention paid to the $"$J-1 anomaly$"$, represented by an abnormal ordering of the lowest 7/2$^{+}$ and 9/2$^{+}$ states. By examining previously published data and newly performed calculations, it is demonstrated that the experimentally known level schemes and electromagnetic properties of $^{103-115}$Ag can be reproduced well within IBFM-1 by using a consistent set of model parameters. The contribution of different single-particle orbitals to the structure of the lowest-lying excited nuclear states in $^{103-115}$Ag is discussed. Given that the $J$-1 anomaly brings down the 7/2$^{+}$ level from the $j^{-3}$ multiplet to energies which can be thermally populated in hot stellar environments, the importance of low-lying excited states in odd-$A$ silver isotopes for astrophysical processes is outlined.</description>

      <title>Extracting the kinetic freeze-out properties of high energy pp collisions at the LHC with event shape classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event shape measurements are crucial for understanding the underlying event and multiple-parton interactions (MPIs) in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions. In this paper, the Tsallis Blast-Wave model with independent non-extensive parameters for mesons and baryons, was applied to analyze transverse momentum spectra of charged pions, kaons, and protons in pp collision events at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV classified by event shape estimators relative transverse event activity, spherocity, and flattenicity. Our analysis indicates that the transverse momentum spectra with different event shapes can be well described by this model. Events exhibiting higher activity or a greater degree of angular isotropy consistently show stronger radial flow and smaller non-extensive parameters across different event shape classifiers, reflecting the increasing role of soft quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. Compared to the charged multiplicity classified events for pp collisions and PbPb collisions, a universal scaling in the kinetic freeze-out temperature and non-extensive parameter across all collision system types and event shape measurements is observed, suggesting a unified partonic evolution stage governed by similar QCD dynamics. It has been shown that the introduction of event-shape observables in pp collisions has significantly expanded the accessible freeze-out parameter space, enabling a more comprehensive exploration of its boundaries. Among the event shape classifiers, flattenicity emerges as a unique observable for disentangling hard process contributions from additive MPI effects, allowing the isolation of collective motion effects encoded by the radial flow velocity. Through the analysis of the interplay between event-shape measurements and kinetic freeze-out properties, we gain deeper insights into the mechanisms responsible for flow-like signatures in pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking nuclear matrix elements of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) remains a critical challenge in designing and interpreting experiments aimed at discovering neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Here, we identify a class of observables, distinct from those employed in low-energy nuclear structure applications, that are strongly correlated with the NMEs: momentum correlations among hadrons produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. Focusing on the $^{150}$Nd$\rightarrow$$^{150}$Sm transition, we combine a Bayesian analysis of the structure of $^{150}$Nd with simulations of high-energy $^{150}$Nd+$^{150}$Nd collisions. We reveal prominent correlations between the NMEs and features of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in these processes, such as spatial gradients and anisotropies, which are accessible via collective flow measurements. Our findings demonstrate collider experiments involving $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay candidates as a platform for benchmarking theoretical predictions of the NMEs.</description>

      <title>Projective Imaging of High-Energy Nuclei via Coherent Exclusive Vector Meson Production in Electron-Nucleus Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of modern nuclear experiments is to study the distributions of gluons inside nuclei at high energy. A key measurement is the coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive electron-nucleus collisions, where the gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the squared nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution. This research aims to overcome the two main obstacles of the $|t|$ measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$ arising from the momentum resolution of the outgoing electron and the overwhelming incoherent background. We demonstrate that by measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution along the direction perpendicular to the electron scattering plane, the effect of the outgoing electron's momentum resolution can be effectively mitigated, and the diffractive pattern is largely restored. Furthermore, we propose to measure the angular distribution of the VM's decay daughters to statistically remove the incoherent background.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum Information Theory of Hadronization: Dihadron Fragmentation and Neutral Polarization in Heavy Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Fusion research in a Deuterium-Tritium tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent ITER re-baselining calls for new fusion-relevant research best carried out in a DT-capable tokamak device with similar technical choices. The present paper describes key issues that could be addressed in a Suitably Enhanced DT-capable Tokamak (SET), with tungsten plasma facing components, boronization systems, and 10 MW of ECRH, based on JET's characteristics and knowledgebase. We discuss hardware options, and show that fusion-relevant operational scenarios could be achieved. Notably, development, validation and testing of fusion and nuclear diagnostics, to be used in next generation devices, would require a DT-capable tokamak as described.</description>
