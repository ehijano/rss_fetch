      <title>On the performance of Active STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Phase Errors and Channel Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ amplification to overcome attenuation caused by the RIS cascaded link. In this paper, we analyze the effects of phase errors and channel aging in active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) RIS-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. By leveraging a spatially correlated Rayleigh fading model, this paper derives minimum mean square error estimate-based channel estimates and formulates closed-form expressions for downlink spectral efficiency. This analytical framework enables a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of channel aging and uniformly distributed phase errors on system performance. The results demonstrate that active STAR-RISs can effectively compensate for the adverse effects of phase errors and channel aging. To counteract the impact of channel aging, we propose practical guidelines for resource-block-length design. Also, an increase in APs and STAR-RIS elements, along with a larger amplification factor, can alleviate performance degradation.</description>

      <title>A Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product Framework for Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS), sparse signals can be reconstructed from significantly fewer samples than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. While non-sparse signals can be sparsely represented in appropriate transformation domains, conventional CS frameworks rely on the incoherence of the measurement matrix columns to guarantee reconstruction performance. This paper proposes a novel method termed Dimension-Keeping Semi-Tensor Product Compressed Sensing (DK-STP-CS), which leverages intra-group correlations while maintaining inter-group incoherence to enhance the measurement matrix design. Specifically, the DK-STP algorithm is integrated into the design of the sensing matrix, enabling dimensionality reduction while preserving signal recovery capability. For image compression and reconstruction tasks, the proposed method achieves notable noise suppression and improves visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that DK-STP-CS significantly outperforms traditional CS and STP-CS approaches, as evidenced by higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values between the reconstructed and original images. The robustness of DK-STP-CS is further validated under noisy conditions and varying sampling rates, highlighting its potential for practical applications in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demands of 6G mobile communication networks necessitate advanced antenna technologies. Movable antennas (MAs) and reconfigurable antennas (RAs) enable dynamic control over antenna's position, orientation, radiation, polarization, and frequency response, introducing rich electromagnetic-domain degrees of freedom for the design and performance enhancement of wireless systems.

      <title>Non-Linear Precoding via Dirty Paper Coding for Near-Field Downlink MISO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 6G systems, extremely large-scale antenna arrays operating at terahertz frequencies extend the near-field region to typical user distances from the base station, enabling near-field communication (NFC) with fine spatial resolution through beamfocusing. Existing multiuser NFC systems predominantly employ linear precoding techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF), which suffer from performance degradation due to the high transmit power required to suppress interference. This paper proposes a nonlinear precoding framework based on Dirty Paper Coding (DPC), which pre-cancels known interference to maximize the sum-rate performance. We formulate and solve the corresponding sum-rate maximization problems, deriving optimal power allocation strategies for both DPC and ZF schemes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DPC achieves substantial sum-rate gains over ZF across various near-field configurations, with the most pronounced improvements observed for closely spaced users.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mediumband Wireless Communication Systems: A Concise Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the necessary procedures for accurately simulating digital wireless communication systems operating in the mediumband, aimed at both beginners and experts. In the research literature, digital wireless communication systems are typically simulated in the discrete-time complex baseband domain, where pulse shaping, upconversion, mixing, carrier synchronization, and symbol timing synchronization are often ignored. These assumptions are indeed sufficient in most cases, but to capture the essence of communication in the mediumband, certain physical layer (PHY) operations should be simulated in detail. In this paper, we concisely describe how to simulate a mediumband wireless communication scenario from a single transmitter (TX) to a single receiver (RX) in MATLAB, elaborating the operation of key PHY subsystems. The approach described here ensures that the simulated system captures the delicate dynamics of mediumband wireless communication, including the effect of deep fading avoidance.</description>

      <title>Local Information-Theoretic Security via Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology based on Euclidean information theory to investigate local properties of secure communication over discrete memoryless wiretap channels. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a legitimate user's information rate while imposing explicit upper bounds on both the information leakage to an eavesdropper and the informational cost of encoding the secret message. By leveraging local geometric approximations, this inherently non-convex problem is transformed into a tractable quadratic programming structure. It is demonstrated that the optimal Lagrange multipliers governing this approximated problem can be found by solving a linear program. The constraints of this linear program are derived from Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and are expressed in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of channel-derived matrices. This framework facilitates the derivation of an analytical formula for an approximate local secrecy capacity. Furthermore, we define and analyze a new class of secret local contraction coefficients. These coefficients, characterized as the largest generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil, quantify the maximum achievable ratio of approximate utility to approximate leakage, thus measuring the intrinsic local leakage efficiency of the channel. We establish bounds connecting these local coefficients to their global counterparts defined over true mutual information measures. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through detailed analysis and numerical illustrations for both general multi-mode channels and the canonical binary symmetric wiretap channel.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Bounds for List Recovery via Discrete Brascamp--Lieb Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coding theory, the problem of list recovery asks one to find all codewords $c$ of a given code $C$ which such that at least $1-\rho$ fraction of the symbols of $c$ lie in some predetermined set of $\ell$ symbols for each coordinate of the code. A key question is bounding the maximum possible list size $L$ of such codewords for the given code $C$.
  In this paper, we give novel combinatorial bounds on the list recoverability of various families of linear and folded linear codes, including random linear codes, random Reed--Solomon codes, explicit folded Reed--Solomon codes, and explicit univariate multiplicity codes. Our main result is that in all of these settings, we show that for code of rate $R$, when $\rho = 1 - R - \epsilon$ approaches capacity, the list size $L$ is at most $(\ell/(R+\epsilon))^{O(R/\epsilon)}$. These results also apply in the average-radius regime. Our result resolves a long-standing open question on whether $L$ can be bounded by a polynomial in $\ell$. In the zero-error regime, our bound on $L$ perfectly matches known lower bounds.
  The primary technique is a novel application of a discrete entropic Brascamp--Lieb inequality to the problem of list recovery, allowing us to relate the local structure of each coordinate with the global structure of the recovered list. As a result of independent interest, we show that a recent result by Chen and Zhang (STOC 2025) on the list decodability of folded Reed--Solomon codes can be generalized into a novel Brascamp--Lieb type inequality.</description>

      <title>From Random to Explicit via Subspace Designs With Applications to Local Properties and Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coding theory, a common question is to understand the threshold rates of various local properties of codes, such as their list decodability and list recoverability. A recent work Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya (FOCS 2025) gave a novel unified framework for calculating the threshold rates of local properties for random linear and random Reed--Solomon codes.
  In this paper, we extend their framework to studying the local properties of subspace designable codes, including explicit folded Reed-Solomon and univariate multiplicity codes. Our first main result is a local equivalence between random linear codes and (nearly) optimal subspace design codes up to an arbitrarily small rate decrease. We show any local property of random linear codes applies to all subspace design codes. As such, we give the first explicit construction of folded linear codes that simultaneously attain all local properties of random linear codes. Conversely, we show that any local property which applies to all subspace design codes also applies to random linear codes.
  Our second main result is an application to matroid theory. We show that the correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code can be identified in deterministic polynomial time, assuming a positive answer to a matroid-theoretic question due to Mason (1981). This improves on a result of Jackson and Tanigawa (JCTB 2024) who gave a complexity characterization of $\mathsf{RP} \cap \mathsf{coNP}$ assuming a stronger conjecture. Our result also applies to the generic bipartite rigidity and matrix completion matroids.
  As a result of additional interest, we study the existence and limitations of subspace designs. In particular, we tighten the analysis of family of subspace designs constructioned by Guruswami and Kopparty (Combinatorica 2016) and show that better subspace designs do not exist over algebraically closed fields.</description>

Abstract: We study the shortest vector lengths in module lattices over arbitrary number fields, with an emphasis on cyclotomic fields. In particular, we sharpen the techniques of arXiv:2308.15275v2 to establish improved results for the variance of the number of lattice vectors of bounded Euclidean norm in a random module lattice. We then derive tight probabilistic bounds for the shortest vector lengths for several notions of random module lattice.</description>

      <title>A faster algorithm for efficient longest common substring calculation for non-parametric entropy estimation in sequential data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-parametric entropy estimation on sequential data is a fundamental tool in signal processing, capturing information flow within or between processes to measure predictability, redundancy, or similarity. Methods based on longest common substrings (LCS) provide a non-parametric estimate of typical set size but are often inefficient, limiting use on real-world data. We introduce LCSFinder, a new algorithm that improves the worst-case performance of LCS calculations from cubic to log-linear time. Although built on standard algorithmic constructs - including sorted suffix arrays and persistent binary search trees - the details require care to provide the matches required for entropy estimation on dynamically growing sequences. We demonstrate that LCSFinder achieves dramatic speedups over existing implementations on real and simulated data, enabling entropy estimation at scales previously infeasible in practical signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Holographic video communication is considered a paradigm shift in visual communications, becoming increasingly popular for its ability to offer immersive experiences. This article provides an overview of holographic video communication and outlines the requirements of a holographic video communication system. Particularly, following a brief review of semantic com- munication, an architecture for a semantic-enabled holographic video communication system is presented. Key technologies, including semantic sampling, joint semantic-channel coding, and semantic-aware transmission, are designed based on the proposed architecture. Two related use cases are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed methods. Finally, potential research topics are discussed to pave the way for the realization of semantic-enabled holographic video communications.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Wireless DJSCC Symbols to Rate Constrained Wired Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has emerged as a robust alternative to traditional separate coding for communications through wireless channels. Existing DJSCC approaches focus primarily on point-to-point wireless communication scenarios, while neglecting end-to-end communication efficiency in hybrid wireless-wired networks such as 5G and 6G communication systems. Considerable redundancy in DJSCC symbols against wireless channels becomes inefficient for long-distance wired transmission. Furthermore, DJSCC symbols must adapt to the varying transmission rate of the wired network to avoid congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework designed for efficient wired transmission of DJSCC symbols within hybrid wireless-wired networks, namely Rate-Controllable Wired Adaptor (RCWA). RCWA achieves redundancy-aware coding for DJSCC symbols to improve transmission efficiency, which removes considerable redundancy present in DJSCC symbols for wireless channels and encodes only source-relevant information into bits. Moreover, we leverage the Lagrangian multiplier method to achieve controllable and continuous variable-rate coding, which can encode given features into expected rates, thereby minimizing end-to-end distortion while satisfying given constraints. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the superior RD performance and robustness of RCWA compared to existing baselines, validating its potential for wired resource utilization in hybrid transmission scenarios. Specifically, our method can obtain peak signal-to-noise ratio gain of up to 0.7dB and 4dB compared to neural network-based methods and digital baselines on CIFAR-10 dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalable Pilot Assignment for Distributed Massive MIMO using Channel Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pilot contamination remains a major bottleneck in realizing the full potential of distributed massive MIMO systems. We propose two dynamic and scalable pilot assignment strategies designed for practical deployment in such networks. First, we present a low complexity centralized algorithm that sequentially assigns pilots to user equipments (UEs) to minimize the global channel estimation errors across serving access points (APs). This improves the channel estimation quality and reduces interference among UEs, enhancing the spectral efficiency. Second, we develop a fully distributed algorithm that uses a priority-based pilot selection approach. In this algorithm, each selected AP minimizes estimation error using only local information and offers candidate pilots to the UEs. Every UE then selects a suitable pilot based on AP priority. This approach ensures consistency and minimizes interference while significantly reducing pilot contamination. The method requires no global coordination, maintains low signaling overhead, and adapts dynamically to the UE deployment. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes in terms of network throughput when compared to other state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for performing lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This quantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main component of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed of loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and rate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be able to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product. Specifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is applied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per entry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate matrix product $A^\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower bound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate $R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically, we construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit guarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$ in terms of only Frobenius norms $\|\bar{A}\|_F, \|\bar{B}\|_F$ and $\|\bar{A}^\top \bar{B}\|_F$, where $\bar{A},\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$ with zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our quantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A practical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite close to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix multiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition at $R\approx 0.906$ bit/entry, showing necessity of Johnson-Lindestrauss dimensionality reduction (sketching) in the low-rate regime.</description>

      <title>A Theoretically-Grounded Codebook for Digital Semantic Communications</title>

Abstract: The use of a learnable codebook provides an efficient way for semantic communications to map vector-based high-dimensional semantic features onto discrete symbol representations required in digital communication systems. In this paper, the problem of codebook-enabled quantization mapping for digital semantic communications is studied from the perspective of information theory. Particularly, a novel theoretically-grounded codebook design is proposed for jointly optimizing quantization efficiency, transmission efficiency, and robust performance. First, a formal equivalence is established between the one-to-many synonymous mapping defined in semantic information theory and the many-to-one quantization mapping based on the codebook's Voronoi partitions. Then, the mutual information between semantic features and their quantized indices is derived in order to maximize semantic information carried by discrete indices. To realize the semantic maximum in practice, an entropy-regularized quantization loss based on empirical estimation is introduced for end-to-end codebook training. Next, the physical channel-induced semantic distortion and the optimal codebook size for semantic communications are characterized under bit-flip errors and semantic distortion. To mitigate the semantic distortion caused by physical channel noise, a novel channel-aware semantic distortion loss is proposed. Simulation results on image reconstruction tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed theoretically-grounded codebook that achieves a 24.1% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 46.5% improvement in learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) compared to the existing codebook designs when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB.</description>

      <title>Far- versus Near-Field RIS Modeling and Beam Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate the mathematical foundation of the modeling and design of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in both the far- and near-field regimes. More specifically, we first present RIS-assisted wireless channel models for the far- and near-field regimes, discussing relevant phenomena, such as line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS links, rich and poor scattering, channel correlation, and array manifold. Subsequently, we introduce two general approaches for the RIS reflective beam design, namely optimization-based and analytical, which offer different degrees of design flexibility and computational complexity. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of simulation results for the performance evaluation of the studied RIS beam designs and the investigation of the impact of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based mmWave MIMO Channel Estimation using sub-6 GHz Channel Information: CNN and UNet Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic Regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>
