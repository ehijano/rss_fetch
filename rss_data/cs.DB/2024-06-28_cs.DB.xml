      <title>LearnedKV: Integrating LSM and Learned Index for Superior Performance on SSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LearnedKV, a novel tiered key-value (KV) store that seamlessly integrates a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree with a Learned Index. This integration yields superior read and write performance compared to standalone indexing structures on SSDs. Our design capitalizes on the LSM tree's high write/update throughput and the Learned Index's fast read capabilities, enabling each component to leverage its strengths. We analyze the impact of size on LSM tree performance and demonstrate how the tiered Learned Index significantly mitigates the LSM tree's size-related performance degradation, particularly by reducing the intensive I/O operations resulting from re-insertions after Garbage Collection (GC). To maintain rapid read performance for newly inserted keys, we introduce a non-blocking conversion mechanism that efficiently transforms the existing LSM tree into a new Learned Index with minimal overhead during GC. Our experimental results, conducted across diverse workloads, show that LearnedKV outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 1.32x in read requests and 1.31x in write performance.</description>

      <title>Constructing and Analyzing Different Density Graphs for Path Extrapolation in Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based models have become pivotal in understanding and predicting navigational patterns within complex networks. Building on graph-based models, the paper advances path extrapolation methods to efficiently predict Wikipedia navigation paths. The Wikipedia Central Macedonia (WCM) dataset is sourced from Wikipedia, with a spotlight on the Central Macedonia region, Greece, to initiate path generation. To build WCM, a crawling process is used that simulates human navigation through Wikipedia. Experimentation shows that an extension of the graph neural network GRETEL, which resorts to dual hypergraph transformation, performs better on a dense graph of WCM than on a sparse graph of WCM. Moreover, combining hypergraph features with features extracted from graph edges has proven to enhance the model's effectiveness. A superior model's performance is reported on the WCM dense graph than on the larger Wikispeedia dataset, suggesting that size may not be as influential in predictive accuracy as the quality of connections and feature extraction. The paper fits the track Knowledge Discovery and Machine Learning of the 16th International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications.</description>

      <title>MINE GRAPH RULE: A New Cypher-like Operator for Mining Association Rules on Property Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mining information from graph databases is becoming overly important. To approach this problem, current methods focus on identifying subgraphs with specific topologies; as of today, no work has been focused on expressing jointly the syntax and semantics of mining operations over rich property graphs. We define MINE GRAPH RULE, a new operator for mining association rules from graph databases, by extending classical approaches used in relational databases and exploited by recommending systems. We describe the syntax and semantics of the operator, which is based on measuring the support and confidence of each rule, and then we provide several examples of increasing complexity on top of a realistic example; our operator embeds Cypher for expressing the mining conditions. MINE GRAPH RULE is implemented on top of Neo4j, the most successful graph database system; it takes advantage of built-in optimizations of the Neo4j engine, as well as optimizations that are defined in the context of relational association rules. Our implementation is available as a portable Neo4j plugin. At the end of our paper, we show the execution performance in a variety of settings, by varying the operators, the size of the graph, the ratio between node types, the method for creating relationships, and maximum support and confidence.</description>

      <title>QSketch: An Efficient Sketch for Weighted Cardinality Estimation in Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating cardinality, i.e., the number of distinct elements, of a data stream is a fundamental problem in areas like databases, computer networks, and information retrieval. This study delves into a broader scenario where each element carries a positive weight. Unlike traditional cardinality estimation, limited research exists on weighted cardinality, with current methods requiring substantial memory and computational resources, challenging for devices with limited capabilities and real-time applications like anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose QSketch, a memory-efficient sketch method for estimating weighted cardinality in streams. QSketch uses a quantization technique to condense continuous variables into a compact set of integer variables, with each variable requiring only 8 bits, making it 8 times smaller than previous methods. Furthermore, we leverage dynamic properties during QSketch generation to significantly enhance estimation accuracy and achieve a lower time complexity of $O(1)$ for updating estimations upon encountering a new element. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that QSketch is approximately 30\% more accurate and two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, using only $1/8$ of the memory.</description>

      <title>Research on Image Processing and Vectorization Storage Based on Garage Electronic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the purpose of achieving a more precise definition and data analysis of images, this study conducted a research on vectorization and rasterization storage of electronic maps, focusing on a large underground parking garage map. During the research, image processing, vectorization and rasterization storage were performed. The paper proposed a method for the vectorization classification storage of indoor two-dimensional map raster data. This method involves converting raster data into vector data and classifying elements such as parking spaces, pathways, and obstacles based on their coordinate positions with the grid indexing method, thereby facilitating efficient storage and rapid querying of indoor maps. Additionally, interpolation algorithms were employed to extract vector data and convert it into raster data. Navigation testing was conducted to validate the accuracy and reliability of the map model under this method, providing effective technical support for the digital storage and navigation of garage maps.</description>

      <title>CMRxRecon2024: A Multi-Modality, Multi-View K-Space Dataset Boosting Universal Machine Learning for Accelerated Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a clinically gold-standard technique for diagnosing cardiac diseases, thanks to its ability to provide diverse information with multiple modalities and anatomical views. Accelerated cardiac MRI is highly expected to achieve time-efficient and patient-friendly imaging, and then advanced image reconstruction approaches are required to recover high-quality, clinically interpretable images from undersampled measurements. However, the lack of publicly available cardiac MRI k-space dataset in terms of both quantity and diversity has severely hindered substantial technological progress, particularly for data-driven artificial intelligence. Here, we provide a standardized, diverse, and high-quality CMRxRecon2024 dataset to facilitate the technical development, fair evaluation, and clinical transfer of cardiac MRI reconstruction approaches, towards promoting the universal frameworks that enable fast and robust reconstructions across different cardiac MRI protocols in clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, the CMRxRecon2024 dataset is the largest and most diverse publicly available cardiac k-space dataset. It is acquired from 330 healthy volunteers, covering commonly used modalities, anatomical views, and acquisition trajectories in clinical cardiac MRI workflows. Besides, an open platform with tutorials, benchmarks, and data processing tools is provided to facilitate data usage, advanced method development, and fair performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>RDF Stream Taxonomy: Systematizing RDF Stream Types in Research and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the years, RDF streaming was explored in research and practice from many angles, resulting in a wide range of RDF stream definitions. This variety presents a major challenge in discussing and integrating streaming systems, due to the lack of a common language. This work attempts to address this critical research gap, by systematizing RDF stream types present in the literature in a novel taxonomy. The proposed RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX) is embodied in an OWL 2 DL ontology that follows the FAIR principles, making it readily applicable in practice. Extensive documentation and additional resources are provided, to foster the adoption of the ontology. Three use cases for the ontology are presented with accompanying competency questions, demonstrating the usefulness of the resource. Additionally, this work introduces a novel nanopublications dataset, which serves as a collaborative, living state-of-the-art review of RDF streaming. The results of a multifaceted evaluation of the resource are presented, testing its logical validity, use case coverage, and adherence to the community's best practices, while also comparing it to other works. RDF-STaX is expected to help drive innovation in RDF streaming, by fostering scientific discussion, cooperation, and tool interoperability.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents Global Benchmark Database (GBD), a comprehensive suite of tools for provisioning and sustainably maintaining benchmark instances and their metadata. The availability of benchmark metadata is essential for many tasks in empirical research, e.g., for the data-driven compilation of benchmarks, the domain-specific analysis of runtime experiments, or the instance-specific selection of solvers. In this paper, we introduce the data model of GBD as well as its interfaces and provide examples of how to interact with them. We also demonstrate the integration of custom data sources and explain how to extend GBD with additional problem domains, instance formats and feature extractors.</description>

      <title>Output-Optimal Algorithms for Join-Aggregate Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic Yannakakis framework proposed in 1981 is still the state-of-the-art approach for tackling acyclic join-aggregate queries defined over commutative semi-rings. It has been shown that the time complexity of the Yannakakis framework is $O(N + \OUT)$ for any free-connex join-aggregate query, where $N$ is the input size of database and $\OUT$ is the output size of the query result. This is already output-optimal. However, only a general upper bound $O(N \cdot \OUT)$ on the time complexity of the Yannakakis framework is known for the remaining class of acyclic but non-free-connex queries.
  We first show a lower bound $\Omega\left(N \cdot \OUT^{1- \frac{1}{\outw}} + \OUT\right)$ for computing an acyclic join-aggregate query by {\em semi-ring algorithms}, where $\outw$ is identified as the {\em out-width} of the input query, $N$ is the input size of the database, and $\OUT$ is the output size of the query result. For example, $\outw =2$ for the chain matrix multiplication query, and $\outw=k$ for the star matrix multiplication query with $k$ relations. We give a tighter analysis of the Yannakakis framework and show that Yannakakis framework is already output-optimal on the class of {\em aggregate-hierarchical} queries. However, for the large remaining class of non-aggregate-hierarchical queries, such as chain matrix multiplication query, Yannakakis framework indeed requires $\Theta(N \cdot \OUT)$ time. We next explore a hybrid version of the Yannakakis framework and present an output-optimal algorithm for computing any general acyclic join-aggregate query within $\O\left(N\cdot \OUT^{1-\frac{1}{\outw}} + \OUT\right)$ time, matching the out-width-dependent lower bound up to a poly-logarithmic factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial improvement for computing acyclic join-aggregate queries since 1981.</description>

      <title>CHESS: Contextual Harnessing for Efficient SQL Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for transforming natural language questions into SQL queries (text-to-SQL) is a promising yet challenging approach, particularly when applied to real-world databases with complex and extensive schemas. In particular, effectively incorporating data catalogs and database values for SQL generation remains an obstacle, leading to suboptimal solutions. We address this problem by proposing a new pipeline that effectively retrieves relevant data and context, selects an efficient schema, and synthesizes correct and efficient SQL queries. To increase retrieval precision, our pipeline introduces a hierarchical retrieval method leveraging model-generated keywords, locality-sensitive hashing indexing, and vector databases. Additionally, we have developed an adaptive schema pruning technique that adjusts based on the complexity of the problem and the model's context size. Our approach generalizes to both frontier proprietary models like GPT-4 and open-source models such as Llama-3-70B. Through a series of ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of our pipeline and its impact on the end-to-end performance. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the cross-domain challenging BIRD dataset.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Database Interfaces: A Survey of LLM-based Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating accurate SQL according to natural language questions (text-to-SQL) is a long-standing challenge due to the complexities involved in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Conventional text-to-SQL systems, comprising human engineering and deep neural networks, have made substantial progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed and utilized for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising performance. As modern databases become more complex, the corresponding user questions also grow more challenging, leading PLMs with limited comprehension capabilities to produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods for PLMs, which, in turn, restricts the applications of PLM-based systems. Most recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language understanding as the model scale remains increasing. Therefore, integrating the LLM-based implementation can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of LLM-based text-to-SQL. Specifically, we propose a brief overview of the technical challenges and the evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Then, we provide a detailed introduction to the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. After that, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and propose expectations for future research directions.</description>
