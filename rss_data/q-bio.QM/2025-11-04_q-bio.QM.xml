      <title>AI-derived layer-specific OCT biomarkers for classification of geographic atrophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geographic atrophy (GA) is a key biomarker of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) traditionally identified through color fundus photography. Hyper-transmission defects (hyperTDs), a feature highly correlated with GA, have recently gained prominence in optical coherence tomography (OCT) research. OCT offers cross-sectional imaging of the retina, leading to the development of the terms complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) to describe specific patterns of structural degeneration. Within the definitions of cRORA three critical lesions are implicated: inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer (INL-OPL) subsidence, ellipsoid zone and retinal pigment epithelium (EZ-RPE) disruption, and hyperTDs. To enable the automated quantification of retinal atrophy progression, we propose an AI-based model that segments INL-OPL subsidence, EZ-RPE disruption, and hyperTDs. Additionally, we developed an algorithm that leverages these segmentation results to distinguish cRORA from hyperTDs in the absence of GA. We evaluated our approach on a comprehensive dataset of eyes with AMD and healthy eyes, achieving mean voxel-level F1-scores of 0.76/0.13 (mean/standard deviation) for INL-OPL subsidence, 0.64/0.15 for EZ-RPE disruption, and 0.69/0.04 for hyperTDs. For distinguishing cRORA from hyperTDs, we achieved an average pixel-level F1-score of 0.80/0.12 for segment cRORA from hyperTDs. This method demonstrates significant advances in the quantitative analysis of retinal atrophy, offering a promising tool for improved AMD diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.</description>

      <title>GeneFlow: Translation of Single-cell Gene Expression to Histopathological Images via Rectified Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies can be used to align transcriptomes with histopathological morphology, presenting exciting new opportunities for biomolecular discovery. Using ST data, we construct a novel framework, GeneFlow, to map transcriptomics onto paired cellular images. By combining an attention-based RNA encoder with a conditional UNet guided by rectified flow, we generate high-resolution images with different staining methods (e.g. H&amp;E, DAPI) to highlight various cellular/tissue structures. Rectified flow with high-order ODE solvers creates a continuous, bijective mapping between transcriptomics and image manifolds, addressing the many-to-one relationship inherent in this problem. Our method enables the generation of realistic cellular morphology features and spatially resolved intercellular interactions from observational gene expression profiles, provides potential to incorporate genetic/chemical perturbations, and enables disease diagnosis by revealing dysregulated patterns in imaging phenotypes. Our rectified flow-based method outperforms diffusion-based baseline method in all experiments. Code can be found at https://github.com/wangmengbo/GeneFlow.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling of tumor-immune interactions: methods, applications, and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical oncology is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field that uses mathematical models to enhance our understanding of cancer dynamics, including tumor growth, metastasis, and treatment response. Tumor-immune interactions play a crucial role in cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and the effectiveness of immunotherapy and targeted treatments. However, studying tumor dynamics in isolation often fails to capture the complex interplay between cancer cells and the immune system, which is critical to disease progression and therapeutic efficacy. Mathematical models that incorporate tumor-immune interactions offer valuable insights into these processes, providing a framework for analyzing immune escape, treatment response, and resistance mechanisms. In this review, we provide an overview of mathematical models that describe tumor-immune dynamics, highlighting their applications in understanding tumor growth, evaluating treatment strategies, and predicting immune responses. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of current modeling approaches and propose future directions for the development of more comprehensive and predictive models of tumor-immune interactions. We aim to offer a comprehensive guide to the state of mathematical modeling in tumor immunology, emphasizing its potential to inform clinical decision-making and improve cancer therapies.</description>

      <title>STELLAR-koff: A Transfer Learning Model for Protein-Ligand Dissociation Rate Constant Prediction Based on Interaction Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to successful drug design lies in the correct comprehension of protein-ligand interactions. Within the current knowledge paragm, these interactions can be described from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. In recent years, many deep learning models have emerged for predicting the thermodynamic properties of protein-ligand interactions. However, there is currently no mature model for predicting kinetic properties, primarily due to lack of kinetic data. To tackle this problem, we have developed a graph neural network model called STELLAR-koff (Structure-based TransfEr Learning for Ligand Activity Regression) to predict protein-ligand dissociation rate constant. Unlike traditional protein-ligand property prediction models, which typically use a single complex conformation as input, STELLAR-koff employs transfer learning to transform multiple ligand conformations within the protein into a protein ligand interaction landscape, and uses this landscape as the primary input for the model. In addition, we expanded the PDBbind koff dataset from 680 to 1,197 entries and employed the augmented dataset for model training and testing. When tested through five-fold cross-validation, STELLAR-koff achieved Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.729 surpassing or being on pair with most of the published prediction methods. Tested on external set, STELLAR-koff demonstrated strong predictive performance on unseen protein, achieving a Pearson of 0.838 on the focal adhesion kinase in particular. Experimental validation on cyclin-dependent kinase also demonstrated the effectiveness of STELLAR-koff in real drug discovering scenarios. We believe this study provides an effective tool for predicting protein-ligand dissociation rate constant and offers new insight for the future development of this field.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models at the Drug Discovery Frontier: A Review on Generating Small Molecules versus Therapeutic Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework in generative modeling, showing significant potential to accelerate and transform the traditionally slow and costly process of drug discovery. This review provides a systematic comparison of their application in designing two principal therapeutic modalities: small molecules and therapeutic peptides. We analyze how a unified framework of iterative denoising is adapted to the distinct molecular representations, chemical spaces, and design objectives of each modality. For small molecules, these models excel at structure-based design, generating novel, pocket-fitting ligands with desired physicochemical properties, yet face the critical hurdle of ensuring chemical synthesizability. Conversely, for therapeutic peptides, the focus shifts to generating functional sequences and designing de novo structures, where the primary challenges are achieving biological stability against proteolysis, ensuring proper folding, and minimizing immunogenicity. Despite these distinct challenges, both domains face shared hurdles: the need for more accurate scoring functions, the scarcity of high-quality experimental data, and the crucial requirement for experimental validation. We conclude that the full potential of diffusion models will be unlocked by bridging these modality-specific gaps and integrating them into automated, closed-loop Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) platforms, thereby shifting the paradigm from chemical exploration to the targeted creation of novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stress Disrupts Symbiotic Fluid Dynamics in Bobtail Squid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of thermal stress on beneficial symbiosis, in the face of rapid climate change, remains poorly understood. We investigate this using the model system, Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and its bioluminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, which enables the squid to camouflage itself through counter-illumination. Successful colonisation of the squid by V. fischeri must occur hours after hatching and is mediated by fluid flow due to respiration within the squid mantle cavity. To study this process, we develop a mathematical model using the Method of Regularised Stokeslets to simulate the flow and resulting bacterial trajectories within the squid. We explore how thermal stress, mediated by physiological changes in respiration, ciliary dynamics, and internal geometry, affects this early colonisation by analysing the time bacteria spend in regions crucial to the establishment of symbiosis in these simulations. A variance-based sensitivity analysis of physiologically relevant parameters on these metrics demonstrates that changes in the breath cycle significantly impact and reduce the time bacteria spend in the critical zone within the squid, hindering colonisation.</description>

      <title>Sparse and nonparametric estimation of equations governing dynamical systems with applications to biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of model equations is a powerful approach for understanding the behavior of dynamical systems in many scientific fields. In particular, the ability to learn mathematical models from data would benefit systems biology, where the complex nature of these systems often makes a bottom up approach to modeling unfeasible. In recent years, sparse estimation techniques have gained prominence in system identification, primarily using parametric paradigms to efficiently capture system dynamics with minimal model complexity. In particular, the Sindy algorithm has successfully used sparsity to estimate nonlinear systems by extracting from a library of functions only a few key terms needed to capture the dynamics of these systems. However, parametric models often fall short in accurately representing certain nonlinearities inherent in complex systems. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that integrates sparse parametric estimation with nonparametric techniques. It captures nonlinearities that Sindy cannot describe without requiring a priori information about their functional form. That is, without expanding the library of functions to include the one that is trying to be discovered. We illustrate our approach on several examples related to estimation of complex biological phenomena.</description>

      <title>Detecting active L\'evy particles using differential dynamic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting L\'evy flights of cells has been a challenging problem in experiments. The challenge lies in accessing data in spatiotemporal scales across orders of magnitude, which is necessary for reliably extracting a power-law scaling. Differential dynamic microscopy has been shown to be a powerful method that allows one to acquire statistics of cell motion across scales, which is a potentially versatile method for detecting L\'evy walks in biological systems. In this article, we extend the differential dynamic microscopy method to self-propelled L\'evy particles, whose run-time distribution has a algebraic tail. We validate our protocol using synthetic imaging data and show that a reliable detection of active L\'evy particles requires accessing length scales of one order of magnitude larger than its persistence length. Applying the protocol to experimental data of E. coli and E. gracilis, we find that E. coli exhibits no signature of L\'evy walks, while E. gracilis is better described as active L\'evy particles.</description>

      <title>Modeling Microenvironment Trajectories on Spatial Transcriptomics with NicheFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</description>

      <title>Identification of Capture Phases in Nanopore Protein Sequencing Data Using a Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanopore protein sequencing produces long, noisy ionic current traces in which key molecular phases, such as protein capture and translocation, are embedded. Capture phases mark the successful entry of a protein into the pore and serve as both a checkpoint and a signal that a channel merits further analysis. However, manual identification of capture phases is time-intensive, often requiring several days for expert reviewers to annotate the data due to the need for domain-specific interpretation of complex signal patterns. To address this, a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was developed and trained to detect capture phases in down-sampled signal windows. Evaluated against CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) hybrids, histogram-based classifiers, and other CNN variants using run-level data splits, our best model, CaptureNet-Deep, achieved an F1 score of 0.94 and precision of 93.39% on held-out test data. The model supports low-latency inference and is integrated into a dashboard for Oxford Nanopore experiments, reducing the total analysis time from several days to under thirty minutes. These results show that efficient, real-time capture detection is possible using simple, interpretable architectures and suggest a broader role for lightweight ML models in sequencing workflows.</description>

      <title>Geometric Modeling of Hippocampal Tau Deposition: A Surface-Based Framework for Covariate Analysis and Off-Target Contamination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework combining geometric modeling with disease progression analysis to investigate tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) data. Focusing on the hippocampus, we construct a principal surface that captures the spatial distribution and morphological changes of tau pathology. By projecting voxels onto this surface, we quantify tau coverage, intensity, and thickness through bidirectional projection distances and interpolated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). This low-dimensional embedding preserves spatial specificity while mitigating multiple comparison issues. Covariate effects are analyzed using a two-stage regression model with inverse probability weighting to adjust for signal sparsity and selection bias. Using the SuStaIn model, we identify subtypes and stages of AD, revealing distinct tau dynamics: the limbic-predominant subtype shows age-related nonlinear accumulation in coverage and thickness, whereas the posterior subtype exhibits uniform SUVR increases across disease progression. Model-based predictions show that hippocampal tau deposition follows a structured spatial trajectory expanding bidirectionally with increasing thickness, while subtype differences highlight posterior hippocampal involvement consistent with whole-brain patterns. Finally, directional signal patterns on the principal surface reveal contamination from the choroid plexus, demonstrating the broader applicability of the proposed framework across modalities including amyloid PET.</description>

      <title>Low-fat diets and testosterone in men: Systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Higher endogenous testosterone levels are associated with reduced chronic disease risk and mortality. Since the mid-20th century, there have been significant changes in dietary patterns, and men's testosterone levels have declined in western countries. Cross-sectional studies show inconsistent associations between fat intake and testosterone in men.
  Methods: Studies eligible for inclusion were intervention studies, with minimal confounding variables, comparing the effect of low-fat vs high-fat diets on men's sex hormones. 9 databases were searched from their inception to October 2020, yielding 6 eligible studies, with a total of 206 participants. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane's Review Manager software. Cochrane's risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment.
  Results: There were significant decreases in sex hormones on low-fat vs high-fat diets. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for outcomes were: total testosterone [-0.38 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.01) P = 0.04]; free testosterone [-0.37 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.11) P = 0.005]; urinary testosterone [-0.38 (CI 95% -0.66 to -0.09) P = 0.009], and dihydrotestosterone [-0.3 (CI 95% -0.56 to -0.03) P = 0.03]. There were no significant differences for luteinising hormone or sex hormone binding globulin. Subgroup analysis for total testosterone, European and American men, showed a stronger effect [-0.52 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.3) P &lt; 0.001].
  Conclusions: Low-fat diets appear to decrease testosterone levels in men, but further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this effect. Men with European ancestry may experience a greater decrease in testosterone, in response to a low-fat diet.</description>

      <title>THFlow: A Temporally Hierarchical Flow Matching Framework for 3D Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models provide a promising approach to de novo 3D peptide design. Most of them jointly model the distributions of peptide's position, orientation, and conformation, attempting to simultaneously converge to the target pocket. However, in the early stage of docking, optimizing conformation-only modalities such as rotation and torsion can be physically meaningless, as the peptide is initialized far from the protein pocket and no interaction field is present. We define this problem as the multimodal temporal inconsistency problem and claim it is a key factor contributing to low binding affinity in generated peptides. To address this challenge, we propose THFlow, a novel flow matching-based multimodal generative model that explicitly models the temporal hierarchy between peptide position and conformation. It employs a polynomial based conditional flow to accelerate positional convergence early on, and later aligns it with rotation and torsion for coordinated conformation refinement under the emerging interaction field. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related features, such as polarity, to further enhance the model's understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that THFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering an effective and accurate solution for advancing peptide-based therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>IUPAC-Induced Computational Approaches for Identifying Boosters of Small Biomolecule Functionality: A Case Study of Human Tyrosyl-DNA Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) Inhibitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces several proof-of-concept (PoC) computational methods intended to offer biochemical researchers straightforward, time- and cost-effective strategies to accelerate their work. While Machine Learning (ML) models were developed, the study's central purpose was to explore approaches for the identification of desirable functional groups/fragments in small biomolecules regarding a specific functionality, which, in this case, was human tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) inhibition. This was achieved primarily by tokenising IUPAC names to generate features. Additionally, the applicability of the CID_SID ML model for predicting TDP1 activity was developed and explored. Since these computational approaches were not experimentally validated due to a lack of appropriate laboratory facilities, they are presented as open proposals for further laboratory investigation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Feature Learning in Weakly Labelled Bioacoustic Cetacean Datasets via a Variational Autoencoder and Temporal Convolutional Network: An Interdisciplinary Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioacoustics data from Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) poses a unique set of challenges for classification, particularly the limited availability of complete and reliable labels in datasets due to annotation uncertainty, biological complexity due the heterogeneity in duration of cetacean vocalizations, and masking of target sounds due to environmental and anthropogenic noise. This means that data is often weakly labelled, with annotations indicating presence/absence of species over several minutes. In order to effectively capture the complex temporal patterns and key features of lengthy continuous audio segments, we propose an interdisciplinary framework comprising dataset standardisation, feature extraction via Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and classification via Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). This approach eliminates the necessity for manual threshold setting or time-consuming strong labelling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we use sperm whale (&lt;i&gt;Physeter macrocephalus&lt;/i&gt;) click trains in 4-minute recordings as a case study, from a dataset comprising diverse sources and deployment conditions to maximise generalisability. The value of feature extraction via the VAE is demonstrated by comparing classification performance against the traditional and explainable approach of expert handpicking of features. The TCN demonstrated robust classification capabilities achieving AUC scores exceeding 0.9.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. This study compares the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error that is 7% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.37% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language Model-Based Semantic-Guided Imaging Biomarker for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models have utilized semantic features, deep features, or both to assess lung nodule malignancy. However, their reliance on manual annotation during inference, limited interpretability, and sensitivity to imaging variations hinder their application in real-world clinical settings. Thus, this research aims to integrate semantic features derived from radiologists' assessments of nodules, guiding the model to learn clinically relevant, robust, and explainable imaging features for predicting lung cancer. We obtained 938 low-dose CT scans from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with 1,261 nodules and semantic features. Additionally, the Lung Image Database Consortium dataset contains 1,018 CT scans, with 2,625 lesions annotated for nodule characteristics. Three external datasets were obtained from UCLA Health, the LUNGx Challenge, and the Duke Lung Cancer Screening. We fine-tuned a pretrained Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to align imaging and semantic text features and predict the one-year lung cancer diagnosis. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the NLST test set with an AUROC of 0.901 and AUPRC of 0.776. It also showed robust results in external datasets. Using CLIP, we also obtained predictions on semantic features through zero-shot inference, such as nodule margin (AUROC: 0.807), nodule consistency (0.812), and pleural attachment (0.840). Our approach surpasses the SOTA models in predicting lung cancer across datasets collected from diverse clinical settings, providing explainable outputs, aiding clinicians in comprehending the underlying meaning of model predictions. This approach also prevents the model from learning shortcuts and generalizes across clinical settings. The code is available at https://github.com/luotingzhuang/CLIP_nodule.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a species remains invariant despite changes in total supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate-but not exact-robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of a network itself. Here, we introduce a previously underappreciated phenomenon, namely asymptotic ACR (aACR): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the network structure, without requiring exact ACR motifs or negligible parameters. We find that aACR is more pervasive than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the Escherichia coli EnvZ-OmpR osmoregulation system and a futile cycle. Furthermore, we prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structure without fine-tuning of kinetic parameters. The notion of aACR provides a rigorous and practical tool to analyze robust responses in broad biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Mantis: A Simulation-Grounded Foundation Model for Disease Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low-resource settings is hampered by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data. We evaluated Mantis against 48 forecasting models across six diseases with diverse transmission modes, assessing both point forecast accuracy (mean absolute error) and probabilistic performance (weighted interval score and coverage). Despite using no real-world data during training, Mantis achieved lower mean absolute error than all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub when backtested on early pandemic forecasts. Across all other diseases tested, including respiratory, vector-borne, and waterborne pathogens, Mantis consistently ranked in the top two models across all evaluation metrics. Notably, Mantis generalized to diseases with transmission mechanisms not represented in its training data, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics rather than memorizing disease-specific patterns. These capabilities position Mantis as a practical foundation for disease forecasting: general-purpose, accurate, and deployable where traditional models fail.</description>

      <title>Practical indistinguishability in a gene regulatory network inference problem, a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining mechanistic models of gene regulation, especially underlying phenotypic variation, is a central goal of both mathematical biology and modern evolutionary biology. However, several challenges, involving both common characteristics of experimental data and the model development process, remain that limit the discovery of general principles. Even the highest-quality experimental data come with challenges. There are always sources of noise, a limit to how often we can measure the system in time, and it is impossible to measure all the relevant states that participate in the full underlying complexity. Additionally, there are usually sources of uncertainty in the underlying biological mechanisms, which give rise to multiple competing model structures. We walk through a case study involving inference of a regulatory network structure involved in a developmental decision in the nematode, \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}. In this study, we fit 13,824 distinct regulatory network models to gene expression data from three experimental conditions to determine which regulatory features are supported by the data. We discover \textit{model sets}, or collections of models with shared regulatory network features that best fit the data, for each of the three experiments we considered, and identify a regulatory network in the intersection of the three model sets. This model describes the data across the experimental conditions and exhibits a high degree of positive regulation and interconnectivity between the key regulators, \textit{eud-1}, \textit{sult-1}, and \textit{nhr-40}. While the biological results are specific to the molecular biology of development in \textit{Pristonchus pacificus}, the comparative modeling framework introduced here can be applied to other systems of gene regulation in an evolutionary developmental context.</description>

      <title>InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.</description>
