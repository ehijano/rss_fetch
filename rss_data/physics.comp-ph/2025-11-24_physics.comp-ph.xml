      <title>A DSMC method for the space homogeneous multispecies Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method for the spatially homogeneous multispecies Landau-Fokker-Planck equation. The scheme is derived from a first-order approximation of the multispecies Boltzmann operator in the grazing collision limit and employs a regularized, easy-to-sample scattering kernel that removes the need for iterative solvers while preserving the fundamental invariants of the Landau dynamics. The method is fully mesh-free -- being a Monte Carlo particle algorithm -- which makes it naturally scalable to high-dimensional velocity spaces and straightforward to couple with particle-in-cell (PIC) solvers via operator splitting. A notable feature of our approach is its ability to treat realistic mass ratios: we show accurate simulations up to the physical proton-electron ($p$-$e$) mass ratio $m_p/m_e \approx 1836$. We validate the method against the multispecies BKW benchmark for Maxwellian interactions and study collisional relaxation for Coulomb interactions, showing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and the expected trend towards Maxwellian equilibria.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Resource Landscape of Entropy Vector Space Using Machine Learning and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian constitutive model selection for high-strain-rate soft material characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-fidelity characterization of soft, tissue-like materials under ultra-high-strain-rate conditions is critical in engineering and medicine. Still, it remains challenging due to limited optical access, sensitivity to initial conditions, and experimental variability. Microcavitation techniques (e.g., laser-induced microcavitation) have emerged as a viable method for determining the mechanical properties of soft materials in the ultra-high-strain-rate regime (higher than 10^3 s^{-1}); however, they are limited by measurement noise and uncertainty in parameter estimation. A hierarchical Bayesian model selection method is employed using the Inertial Microcavitation Rheometry (IMR) technique to address these limitations. With this method, the parameter space of different constitutive models is explored to determine the most credible constitutive model that describes laser-induced microcavitation bubble oscillations in soft, viscoelastic, transparent hydrogels. The target data/evidence is computed using a weighted Gaussian likelihood with a hierarchical noise scale, which enables the quantification of uncertainty in model plausibility. Physically informed priors, including range-invariant, stress-based parameter priors, a model-redundancy prior, and a Bayesian Information Criterion motivated model prior, penalize complex models to enforce Occam's razor. Using a precomputed grid of simulations, the probabilistic model selection process enables an initial guess for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) material parameter values. Synthetic tests recover the ground-truth models and expected parameters. Using experimental data for gelatin, fibrin, polyacrylamide, and agarose, MAP simulations of credible models reproduce the data. Moreover, a cross-institutional comparison of 10% gelatin indicates consistent constitutive model selection.</description>

      <title>The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Computer Simulation of Gel Formation in Colloidal Systems of Sticky Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and validate a simulation framework for colloidal gelation. We first reproduce the benchmark results of Santos, Campanella, and Carignano for spherical, gel-forming particles, then extend the methodology to more complex systems of ``sticky'' spherocylindrical rods interacting via a Kihara-like potential. Using comprehensive parameter sweeps documented for reproducibility, we analyze the emergence of porous, percolating networks and conduct a topological characterization of the resulting microstructures. This characterization leverages Early TDA to extract multiscale connectivity features and to define topology-driven metrics for automated comparison between simulations and experiments. Our simulations reveal a clear dependence of network formation on rod aspect ratio and particle density, consistent with established theory and, to our knowledge, not previously demonstrated for spherocylindrical colloids with Kihara-type interactions. Rheological probing of the simulated systems shows signatures characteristic of gels, which supports the structural analysis. We further compare our computational results with experimental data obtained on Bastian Trepka's gels collected by Jacob Steindl. Although these first comparisons indicate that the present model is not yet sufficient to quantitatively describe those specific gelled systems, the agreement in qualitative trends and the robustness of our tools suggest strong potential. Overall, the work demonstrates functional, extensible methods for simulating gelation in rod-based colloids, provides topological data analysis based metrics that can aid automated comparison between experiments and simulations, and outlines several promising directions for future refinement and application.</description>

      <title>The impact of ionising collisions on channeling and radiation emission for high-energy electrons and positrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions with atoms in a crystalline environment on the channeling efficiency and intensity of the channeling radiation for high-energy electrons and positrons passing through oriented crystalline targets. This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin-Mediated Relaxation Mechanisms of the V$_{B}^-$ Center in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.</description>
