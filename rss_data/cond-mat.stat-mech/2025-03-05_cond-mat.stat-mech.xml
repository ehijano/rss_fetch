      <title>Spectroscopic classification of non-ergodic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-ergodicity impacts statistical inference in a diverse range of disciplines inside and outside of physics. However the concept of ergodicity is used inconsistently, and may refer to several nonequivalent notions. To help address this, we first identify and clarify the relationship between three major interpretations of ergodicity. We then introduce a method of spectral analysis of non-ergodicity which may be performed using data alone, and so may be applied in both numerical and empirical contexts. This may be used to identify, quantify, and classify non-ergodic populations within an ergodic decomposition. This is demonstrated with an application to the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained lattice glass model.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of a cold tracer in a hot bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a zero-temperature particle interacting linearly with a bath of hot Brownian particles. Starting with the most general model of a linearly-coupled bath, we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom exactly to map the tracer dynamics onto a generalized Langevin equation, allowing for an arbitrary external potential on the tracer. We apply this result to determine the fate of a tracer connected by springs to $N$ identical bath particles or inserted within a harmonic chain of hot particles. In the former "fully-connected" case, we find the tracer to transition between an effective equilibrium regime at large $N$ and an FDT-violating regime at finite $N$, while in the latter "loop" model the tracer never satisfies an FDT. We then study the fully-connected model perturbatively for large but finite $N$, demonstrating signatures of irreversibility such as ratchet currents, non-Boltzmann statistics, and positive entropy production. Finally, we specialize to harmonic external potentials on the tracer, allowing us to exactly solve the dynamics of both the tracer and the bath for an arbitrary linear model. We apply our findings to show that a cold tracer in a hot lattice suppresses the fluctuations of the lattice in a long-ranged manner, and we generalize this result to linear elastic field theories.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics in Short-Range Quadratic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate critical transport and the dynamical exponent through the spreading of an initially localized particle in quadratic Hamiltonians with short-range hopping in lattice dimension $d_l$. We consider critical dynamics that emerges when the Thouless time, i.e., the saturation time of the mean-squared displacement, approaches the typical Heisenberg time. We establish a relation, $z=d_l/d_s$, linking the critical dynamical exponent $z$ to $d_l$ and to the spectral fractal dimension $d_s$. This result has notable implications: it says that superdiffusive transport in $d_l\geq 2$ and diffusive transport in $d_l\geq 3$ cannot be critical in the sense defined above. Our findings clarify previous results on disordered and quasiperiodic models and, through Fibonacci potential models in two and three dimensions, provide non-trivial examples of critical dynamics in systems with $d_l\neq1$ and $d_s\neq1$.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration in Clifford Circuits and Beyond: From Random Tensor Networks to Pseudo-Magic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic resource injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling and benchmarking of computational quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Universal Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local counterdiabatic (CD) driving provides a systematic way of constructing a control protocol to approximately suppress the excitations resulting from changing some parameter(s) of a quantum system at a finite rate. However, designing CD protocols typically requires knowledge of the original Hamiltonian a priori. In this work, we design local CD driving protocols in Krylov space using only the characteristic local time scales of the system set by e.g. phonon frequencies in materials or Rabi frequencies in superconducting qubit arrays. Surprisingly, we find that convergence of these universal protocols is controlled by the asymptotic high frequency tails of the response functions. This finding hints at a deep connection between the long-time, low frequency response of the system controlling non-adiabatic effects, and the high-frequency response determined by the short-time operator growth and the Krylov complexity, which has been elusive until now.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01958v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</description>

      <title>Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</description>

      <title>Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.</description>

      <title>Spatial competition and repulsion: pattern formation and the role of movement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter investigates some mechanisms behind pattern formation driven by competitive-only or repelling interactions, and explores how these patterns are influenced by different types of particle movement. Despite competition and repulsion are both anti-crowding interactions, collective effects may lead to clusters of individuals, which can arrange periodically. Through the analysis of two models, it provides insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns formed and underlines the role of movement in shaping the spatial distribution of biological populations.</description>

      <title>Twist deformation of physical trefoil knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knots across various length scales, from micro to macro-scales, such as polymers, DNA, shoelaces, and surgery, serving their unique mechanical properties. The shape of ideal knots has been extensively studied in the context of knot theory, while that of physical knots has been discussed very recently. The complex interplay of elasticity and geometry, such as bending, twisting, and contact, needs to be disentangled to predict their deformation. Still, the unified understanding of the deformation of physical knots is insufficient. Here, we focus on the trefoil knot, a closed knot with a nontrivial topology, and study the relationship between the shapes of the trefoil knot and applied physical twists, combining experiments and simulations. As we twist the elastomeric rod, the knot becomes either tightened or loosened, preserving the original three-fold symmetry, and then buckles and exhibits symmetry breaking at critical angles. The curvature profiles computed through the X-ray tomography analysis also exhibit similar symmetry breaking. The transition would be triggered by the mechanical instability, where the imposed twist energy is converted into the bending energy. The phase transition observed here is analogous to the classical buckling phenomena of elastic rings known as the Michell instability. We find that the twist buckling instability of the trefoil knot results from the interplay of bending, twisting, and contact properties of the rod. In other words, the buckling of the knot is predictable based on the elasticity and geometry of rods, which would be useful in avoiding or even utilizing their buckling in practical engineering applications such as surgery and the shipping industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of self-propelled, proliferating finite-size disks with game-theoretical interactions, where growth rates depend on local population composition. We analyze how these interactions influence spatial distribution, coexistence, and extinction. Three scenarios emerge: (i) stable coexistence with well-mixed distributions, (ii) bistability, where the outcome depends on initial conditions, and (iii) dominance, where one species always outcompetes the other. We further show that activity enhances spatial mixing in coexistence and reduces extinction times in both dominance and bistability. Additionally, stronger interactions promote coexistence while accelerating extinction in the latter two regimes. By varying diffusivity, activity, and interaction strength, we show how movement and spatial constraints affect population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identifying two-dimensional topological phase transition by entanglement spectrum : A fermion Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among many types of quantum entanglement properties, the entanglement spectrum provides more abundant information than other observables. Exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group method could handle the system in one-dimension properly, while in higher dimension, it exceeds the capacity of the algorithms. To expand the ability of existing numerical methods, we takes a different approach via quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. By exploiting particle number and spin symmetry, we realize an efficient algorithms to solve the entanglement spectrum in the interacting fermionic system. Taking two-dimensional interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger as example, we verify the existence of topological phase transition under different types of many-body interactions. The calculated particle number distribution and wave-function of entanglement Hamiltonian indicate that the two belong distinct types of topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of ecological systems is gaining momentum in modern scientific research, driven by an abundance of empirical data and advancements in bioengineering techniques. However, a full understanding of their dynamical and thermodynamical properties, also in light of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, remains a formidable endeavor. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling the interactions within these complex systems -- such as bacteria in microbial communities, plant-pollinator networks in forests, or starling murmurations -- presents a significant challenge. Given the characteristic high dimensionality of the datasets, alternative elegant approaches employ random matrix formalism and techniques from disordered systems. In these lectures, we will explore two cornerstone models in theoretical ecology: the MacArthur/Resource-Consumer model, and the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, with a special focus on systems composed of a large number of interacting species. In the second part, we will highlight timely directions, particularly to bridge the gap with empirical observations and detect macroecological patterns.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>The ordinary surface universality class of the three-dimensional O($N$) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior at the ordinary surface universality class of the three-dimensional O($N$) model, bounded by a two-dimensional surface. Using high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where the leading bulk scaling correction is suppressed, and finite-size scaling analysis of the fourth cumulant of the surface magnetization, we obtain precise estimates of the scaling dimension of the surface field operator for $N=2,3,4$. We also determine the fixed-point values of two renormalization-group invariant observables, which characterize the finite-size scaling behavior at the ordinary transition.</description>

      <title>Physical meaning of principal component analysis for classical lattice systems with translational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the physical implications of applying principal component analysis (PCA) to translationally invariant classical systems defined on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice. Using Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, we demonstrate that the principal components are related to the reciprocal lattice vectors of the hypercubic lattice, and the corresponding eigenvalues are connected to the discrete Fourier transform of the sampled configurations. From a different perspective, we show that the PCA in question can be viewed as a numerical method for computing the ensemble average of the squared moduli of the Fourier transform of physical quantities. Our results also provide a way to determine approximately the principal components of a classical system with translational invariance without the need for matrix diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: information theory and state variables for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significance of statistical physics concepts such as entropy extends far beyond classical thermodynamics. We interpret the similarity between partitions in statistical mechanics and partitions in Bayesian inference as an articulation of a result by Jaynes (1957), who clarified that thermodynamics is in essence a theory of information. In this, every sampling process has a mechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in parameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a continuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between thermodynamic ensembles. This leads to an information theoretic interpretation of Jazinsky's equality, relating the expenditure of work to the influence of data via the likelihood. We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the formalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics (partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law. Different kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are shown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical formulation of sampling processes. Lastly, we propose an effective dimension as a measure of system complexity. A numerical example from cosmology is put forward to illustrate these results.</description>

Abstract: We study a generalized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [D. Jana et al, Phys. Rev. E 109, L032104 (2024)], that sets the paradigm for universality in roughening of growing nonequilibrium surfaces without any conservation laws, but with competing local and nonlocal nonlinear effects. This equation in two dimensions is shown to describe a strong coupling rough or a crumpled surface, in addition to a weak coupling phase. The conformation fluctuations of such a rough surface are given by nonuniversal scaling exponents, with orientational long-ranged order and positional short-ranged order, whereas the crumpled phase has positional and orientational short range order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions have recently emerged as a promising framework for describing new dynamical phenomena in heterogeneous contagion processes. However, a fundamental open question is how to understand their contribution in the eyes of the physics of critical phenomena. Based on mesoscopic field-theoretic Langevin descriptions, we show that: (i) pairwise mechanisms as facilitation or thresholding are formally equivalent to higher-order ones, (ii) pairwise interactions at coarse-grained scales govern the higher-order contact process and, (iii) classical Imry-Ma arguments hold for networks with low spectral dimension. In short, we demonstrate that classical field theories, grounded on model symmetries and/or network dimensionality, still capture the nature of the phase transition, also predicting finite-size effects in real and synthetic networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, based on RT formula, by identifying the pure state UV and IR entanglement entropies of a perturbed CFT$_2$ with geodesic lengths in the bulk, we demonstrate that the dual geometry is uniquely determined to be asymptotically AdS$_3$. The pure AdS$_3$ geometry is recovered by taking the massless limit of the system. Our derivations hold in both static and covariant scenarios.</description>

      <title>Social Network Heterogeneity Promotes Depolarization of Multidimensional Correlated Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the multidimensional social compass model, based on two competing key ingredients: DeGroot learning, driven by the social influence exerted across multiple topics, and the preference of individuals to maintain their initial opinions. The interplay between these two mechanisms triggers a phase transition from polarization to consensus, determined by a threshold value of social influence. We analytically study the nature of the depolarization transition and its threshold depending on the number of topics discussed, the possible correlations between initial opinions, the topology of the underlying social networks, and the correlations between the initial opinion distribution and the network's structure. Theoretical predictions are validated by running numerical simulations on both synthetic and real social networks. We rely on several simplifying assumptions to explore different scenarios, such as a mean-field approximation for high dimension, or orthogonal initial orientations. We uncover an upper critical dimension (D_c = 5 topics) for uncorrelated initial opinions, distinguishing between discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. For the simplest D = 2 case and correlated initial opinions, we found that the depolarization threshold can vanish if the underlying connectivity is heterogeneous, as predicted by perturbation theory. Such an effect is due to the presence of hubs, which promote consensus in the population. We test this hypothesis by designing a rewiring algorithm that increases the structural heterogeneity of the underlying network, showing that the depolarization threshold decreases. Finally, we demonstrate that if hubs share the same initial opinion, the depolarization dynamics is significantly hindered.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Computing via Autonomous Quantum Thermal Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a physics-based model for classical computation based on autonomous quantum thermal machines. These machines consist of few interacting quantum bits (qubits) connected to several environments at different temperatures. Heat flows through the machine are here exploited for computing. The process starts by setting the temperatures of the environments according to the logical input. The machine evolves, eventually reaching a non-equilibrium steady state, from which the output of the computation can be determined via the temperature of an auxilliary finite-size reservoir. Such a machine, which we term a ``thermodynamic neuron'', can implement any linearly-separable function, and we discuss explicitly the cases of NOT, 3-MAJORITY and NOR gates. In turn, we show that a network of thermodynamic neurons can perform any desired function. We discuss the close connection between our model and artificial neurons (perceptrons), and argue that our model provides an alternative physics-based analogue implementation of neural networks, and more generally a platform for thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resetting Mitigates Latent Gradient Bias of SGD from Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Moment method and continued fraction expansion in Floquet Operator Krylov Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recursion methods such as Krylov techniques map complex dynamics to an effective non-interacting problem in one dimension. For example, the operator Krylov space for Floquet dynamics can be mapped to the dynamics of an edge operator of the one-dimensional Floquet inhomogeneous transverse field Ising model (ITFIM), where the latter, after a Jordan-Wigner transformation, is a Floquet model of non-interacting Majorana fermions, and the couplings correspond to Krylov angles. We present an application of this showing that a moment method exists where given an autocorrelation function, one can construct the corresponding Krylov angles, and from that the corresponding Floquet-ITFIM. Consequently, when no solutions for the Krylov angles are obtained, it indicates that the autocorrelation is not generated by unitary dynamics. We highlight this by studying certain special cases: stable $m$-periodic dynamics derived using the method of continued fractions, exponentially decaying and power-law decaying stroboscopic dynamics. Remarkably, our examples of stable $m$-periodic dynamics correspond to $m$-period edge modes for the Floquet-ITFIM where deep in the chain, the couplings correspond to a critical phase. Our results pave the way to engineer Floquet systems with desired properties of edge modes and also provide examples of persistent edge modes in gapless Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Krylov space approach to Singular Value Decomposition in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a tridiagonalization approach for non-Hermitian random matrices and Hamiltonians using singular value decomposition (SVD). This technique leverages the real and non-negative nature of singular values, bypassing the complex eigenvalues typically found in non-Hermitian systems. We analyze the tridiagonal elements, namely the Lanczos coefficients and the associated Krylov (spread) complexity, appropriately defined through the SVD, across several examples, including Ginibre ensembles and the non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We demonstrate that in chaotic cases, the complexity exhibits a distinct peak due to the repulsion between singular values, a feature absent in integrable cases. Using our approach, we analytically compute the Krylov complexity for two-dimensional non-Hermitian random matrices within a subset of non-Hermitian symmetry classes including time-reversal, time-reversal$^{\dagger}$, chiral, and sublattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the fastest paths (FP) in transportation networks under increasing congestion. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the directed FPs connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows. We describe their shape through effective length, detour (maximum distance of FP from a straight line), inness (signed area between FP and straight line), and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the distribution of the performance metric (and its Gini coefficient) across uniformly sampled paths. The study focuses on the traffic loading phenomenon that takes place during the morning peak hour for eight major cities: Networks start with empty edges that are progressively populated by the FPs of single vehicles. As vehicle density grows, the interactions among selfish agents becomes stronger at edge level, and travel speed linearly decreases, thus optimal paths dynamically change with traffic. We fully characterize the transition to congestion and discuss the common aspects among the cities (and some peculiarities), in particular we were able to pinpoint a critical traffic level (or a sequence) for which path shape, rejection ratio, and inequality of the performance degradation, show a concurrent qualitative change. For all cities we observe large peaks for both detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level. Inness shows that paths are slightly attracted by city centers with light traffic, but switch to a strong repulsion immediately beyond the transition. Finally, our path performance metric highlighted a strongly asymmetric behavior when the city neighborhoods act as origins or destinations.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>
