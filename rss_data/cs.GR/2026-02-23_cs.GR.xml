      <title>DesignAsCode: Bridging Structural Editability and Visual Fidelity in Graphic Design Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphic design generation demands a delicate balance between high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural editability. However, existing approaches typically bifurcate into either non-editable raster image synthesis or abstract layout generation devoid of visual content. Recent combinations of these two approaches attempt to bridge this gap but often suffer from rigid composition schemas and unresolvable visual dissonances (e.g., text-background conflicts) due to their inexpressive representation and open-loop nature. To address these challenges, we propose DesignAsCode, a novel framework that reimagines graphic design as a programmatic synthesis task using HTML/CSS. Specifically, we introduce a Plan-Implement-Reflect pipeline, incorporating a Semantic Planner to construct dynamic, variable-depth element hierarchies and a Visual-Aware Reflection mechanism that iteratively optimizes the code to rectify rendering artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DesignAsCode significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both structural validity and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, our code-native representation unlocks advanced capabilities, including automatic layout retargeting, complex document generation (e.g., resumes), and CSS-based animation.</description>

      <title>Robo-Saber: Generating and Simulating Virtual Reality Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first motion generation system for playtesting virtual reality (VR) games. Our player model generates VR headset and handheld controller movements from in-game object arrangements, guided by style exemplars and aligned to maximize simulated gameplay score. We train on the large BOXRR-23 dataset and apply our framework on the popular VR game Beat Saber. The resulting model Robo-Saber produces skilled gameplay and captures diverse player behaviors, mirroring the skill levels and movement patterns specified by input style exemplars. Robo-Saber demonstrates promise in synthesizing rich gameplay data for predictive applications and enabling a physics-based whole-body VR playtesting agent.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth Time-Varying Linear Policies with an Action Jacobian Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning provides a framework for learning control policies that can reproduce diverse motions for simulated characters. However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills. Finally, we apply this approach to create policies for dynamic motions on a physical quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm.</description>

      <title>Diff2DGS: Reliable Reconstruction of Occluded Surgical Scenes via 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is vital for advancing robotic surgery, improving surgeon guidance, and enabling automation. Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.</description>

      <title>MPM Lite: Linear Kernels and Integration without Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MPM Lite, a new hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian method that eliminates the need for particle-based quadrature at solve time. Standard MPM practices suffer from a performance bottleneck where expensive implicit solves are proportional to particle-per-cell (PPC) counts due to the the choices of particle-based quadrature and wide-stencil kernels. In contrast, MPM Lite treats particles primarily as carriers of kinematic state and material history. By conceptualizing the background Cartesian grid as a voxel hexahedral mesh, we resample particle states onto fixed-location quadrature points using efficient, compact linear kernels. This architectural shift allows force assembly and the entire time-integration process to proceed without accessing particles, making the solver complexity no longer relate to particles. At the core of our method is a novel stress transfer and stretch reconstruction strategy. To avoid non-physical averaging of deformation gradients, we resample the extensive Kirchhoff stress and derive a rotation-free deformation reference solution, which naturally supports an optimization-based incremental potential formulation. Consequently, MPM Lite can be implemented as modular resampling units coupled with an FEM-style integration module, enabling the direct use of off-the-shelf nonlinear solvers, preconditioners, and unambiguous boundary conditions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MPM Lite preserves the robustness and versatility of traditional MPM across diverse materials while delivering significant speedups in implicit settings and improving explicit settings at the same time.

      <title>SAMa: Material-aware 3D Selection and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decomposing 3D assets into material parts is a common task for artists, yet remains a highly manual process. In this work, we introduce Select Any Material (SAMa), a material selection approach for in-the-wild objects in arbitrary 3D representations. Building on SAM2's video prior, we construct a material-centric video dataset that extends it to the material domain. We propose an efficient way to lift the model's 2D predictions to 3D by projecting each view into an intermediary 3D point cloud using depth. Nearest-neighbor lookups between any 3D representation and this similarity point cloud allow us to efficiently reconstruct accurate selection masks over objects' surfaces that can be inspected from any view. Our method is multiview-consistent by design, alleviating the need for costly per-asset optimization, and performs optimization-free selection in seconds. SAMa outperforms several strong baselines in selection accuracy and multiview consistency and enables various compelling applications, such as replacing the diffuse-textured materials on a text-to-3D output with PBR materials or selecting and editing materials on NeRFs and 3DGS captures.</description>
