      <title>Axiomatisation for an asynchronous epistemic logic with sending and receiving messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a public announcement logic for asynchronous public announcements wherein the sending of the announcements by the environment is separated from the reception of the announcements by the individual agents. Both come with different modalities. In the logical semantics, formulas are interpreted in a world of a Kripke model but given a history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements that already happened. An axiomatisation AA for such a logic has been given in prior work, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model before any such announcements have taken place. This axiomatisation is a reduction system wherein one can show that every formula is equivalent to a purely epistemic formula without dynamic modalities for announcements and receptions. We propose a generalisation AA* of this axiomatisation, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model given any history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements. It does not extend the axiomatisation AA, for example it is no longer valid that nobody has received any announcement. Unlike AA, this axiomatisation AA* is infinitary and it is not a reduction system.</description>

      <title>A Graded Modal Type Theory for Pulse Schedules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a language for representing the pulse schedules that a superconducting quantum computer accepts as input. The language is a graded modal type theory named PSTT (Pulse Schedule Type Theory). Graded modals type theories are type systems where each variable is annotated with a parameter or grade. These can be used to represent, for example, resource usage, where the grade denotes how many times a given resource may be used; or privacy levels, whether a resource is private or public. In this system, we use the grades to represent timing information. We give categorical semantics to the system and prove soundness and completeness.</description>

      <title>Janus-faces of temporal constraint languages: a dichotomy of expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bodirsky-K\'ara classification of temporal constraint languages stands as one of the earliest and most seminal complexity classifications within infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), yet it remains one of the most mysterious in terms of algorithms and algebraic invariants for the tractable cases. We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</description>

      <title>An Architecture for Spatial Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical spaces are increasingly dense with networked devices, promising seamless coordination and ambient intelligence. Yet today, cloud-first architectures force all communication through wide-area networks regardless of physical proximity. We lack an abstraction for spatial networking: using physical spaces to create boundaries for private, robust, and low-latency communication. We introduce $\textit{Bifr\"ost}$, a programming model that realizes spatial networking using bigraphs to express both containment and connectivity, enabling policies to be scoped by physical boundaries, devices to be named by location, the instantiation of spatial services, and the composition of spaces while maintaining local autonomy. Bifr\"ost enables a new class of spatially-aware applications, where co-located devices communicate directly, physical barriers require explicit gateways, and local control bridges to global coordination.</description>

      <title>Efficient &amp; Correct Predictive Equivalence for Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. The approach of McTavish et al. consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that the QM method may incorrectly decide predictive equivalence, if two key constraints are not respected, and one may be difficult to formally guarantee. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.</description>
