      <title>Ringdown spectroscopy of phenomenologically modified black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic oscillations of black holes, as described by their quasinormal mode spectrum, play a fundamental role in testing general relativity with gravitational waves. The so-called parametrized QNM framework was introduced to predict perturbative changes in the spectrum due to small deviations from general relativity. In this work, we extend the framework to model time-domain signals and study the excitation of quasinormal modes from the time evolution of initial data. Specifically, we quantify whether the perturbative eigenvalue predictions agree with extracting excited quasinormal modes from such simulations. Addressing this issue is particularly important in the context of agnostic ringdown tests and the possible presence of spectral instabilities, which may diminish the promises of black hole spectroscopy. We find that the extracted quasinormal modes agree well with the perturbative predictions, underlining that these types of modifications can, in principle, be robustly tested from real observations. Moreover, we also report the importance of including late-time tails for accurate mode extractions. Finally, we provide a WKB-inspired analysis supporting the importance of the peak of the scattering potential and show robust scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Updated Constraints on Omnipotent Dark Energy: A Comprehensive Analysis with CMB and BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present updated observational constraints on the parameter space of the DMS20 dark energy model, a member of the omnipotent dark energy (ODE) class. Our analysis combines multiple CMB datasets - including measurements from the Planck satellite (PL18), the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) - with Type Ia supernova data from the Pantheon+ catalog (PP), and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the DESI and SDSS surveys. We find that certain data combinations, such as SPT+WMAP+BAO and PL18+BAO, can reduce the significance of the $H_0$ tension below $1\sigma$, but with considerably large uncertainties. These same combinations also predict suppressed structure growth, favoring lower values of $S_8$ compared to the Planck-only constraint. However, the inclusion of PP data restores the tension in $H_0$. To provide a comprehensive view of the ODE phenomenology, we also investigate the evolution of its energy density, emphasizing its dynamical behavior at low redshifts. Our results generically exhibit multiple phantom divide line (PDL) crossings in a single expansion history, a behavior that is not compatible with single scalar field scenarios.</description>

      <title>Physical and Theoretical Challenges to Integrable Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole spacetimes that exhibit integrable singularities have gained considerable interest as alternatives to both regular and singular black holes. Unlike most known regular black hole solutions, these models evade the formation of an inner horizon, thereby circumventing the well-known instability issues associated with such structures. Moreover, it has been suggested that the finite tidal forces near integrable singularities, may allow for a traversable extension beyond them. In this work, we present a set of arguments -- both theoretical, concerning test-field perturbations and the accumulation of matter at the singularity, and practical, related to the behavior of physical probes and extended objects -- with the aim of assessing the validity of the proposed integrability condition, and the feasibility of traversing such singularities. Our analysis highlights key subtleties that challenge the viability of said extensions as alternatives to regular black holes, and underscores the need for a more rigorous investigation of their physical implications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Wormhole Solutions in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of $f(R, T)$ theories extends the Einstein-Hilbert action by incorporating a general function of $R$ and $T$, the Ricci scalar and the trace of the ordinary energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$, respectively, thereby introducing a specific modification to the Einstein's field equations based on matter fields. Given that this modification is intrinsically tied to an energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ that a priori respects energy conditions, we explore the potential of $f(R, T)$ theories admitting wormhole configurations satisfying energy conditions, unlike General Relativity, which typically necessitates exotic matter sources. Consequently, we investigate the existence of dynamical wormhole geometries that either uphold energy conditions or minimize their violations within the framework of trace of energy-momentum squared gravity. To ensure the generality of our study, we consider two distinct equations of state for the matter content and systematically classify possible solutions based on constraints related to the wormhole's throat size, the coupling parameter of the theory, and the equation of state parameters.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Information From Non-vacuum Localised Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Hawking's black hole radiation derivation, including the quantum state of the initial matter forming the black hole. We investigate how non-vacuum initial quantum states, at the past of a black hole geometry, influence the black hole radiation observed at future null infinity $( \mathcal{I}^+)$. We further classify which of the initial state excitations are distinguishable from one another through measurements on the black hole radiation state. We use Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) to provide a clear physical interpretation of the results, in terms of localised operations. We then take a concrete example of a black hole made of one large collapsing excitation of mass $M$ and compare it to a same-mass black hole formed due to the collapse of two smaller excitations, of mass $M/2$ each. We find using our formalism that the two cases yield different radiation states and can in principle be distinguished. Our results provide a mechanism for partial information recovery in evaporating black holes, classify what information is recoverable through stimulated emission, and a concrete understanding of the classification based on the AQFT localisation.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inner horizon in the analog of rotating BTZ black holes by an improved photon fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how to include the inner horizon in the analog of rotating black holes using photon fluids. We find that a vortex beam carrying an improved phase can simulate the rotating BTZ black holes experimentally. In the experiment, we develop a new photon fluid model in a graphene/methanol thermal optical solution, and measure the variation of photon fluid velocity with the radial position using a Fourier plane light spot localization method, while also determining the variation of phonon velocity with the same radial position from the optical vortex intensity distribution. The result provides an extension for the application of optical vortex and a potential possibility for the future experimental exploration about the properties of BTZ black holes and even the anti-de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field through the use of two local modes A and B (detector modes). We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Schwarzschild-like Black Holes with a Generalized Compton Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the generalized Compton wavelength (GCW), emerging from a three-dimensional dynamical quantum vacuum (3D DQV) on Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetimes, motivated by the work of Fiscaletti [10.1134/S0040577925020096] \cite{Fiscaletti:2025iuh}. The GCW modifies the classical geometry through a deformation parameter $ \varepsilon $, encoding quantum gravitational backreaction. We derive exact analytical expressions for the black hole shadow radius, photon sphere, and weak deflection angle, incorporating higher-order corrections and finite-distance effects of a black hole with generalized Compton effect (BHGCE). Using Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data, constraints on $ \varepsilon $ are obtained: $ \varepsilon \in [-2.572, 0.336] $ for Sgr. A* and $ \varepsilon \in [-2.070, 0.620] $ for M87*, both consistent with general relativity yet allowing moderate deviations. Weak lensing analyses via the Keeton-Petters and Gauss-Bonnet formalisms further constrain $ \varepsilon \approx 0.061 $, aligning with solar system bounds. We compute the modified Hawking temperature, showing that positive $ \varepsilon $ suppresses black hole evaporation. Quasinormal mode frequencies in the eikonal limit are also derived, demonstrating that both the oscillation frequency and damping rate shift under GCW-induced corrections. Additionally, the gravitational redshift and scalar perturbation waveform exhibit deformations sensitive to $ \varepsilon $. Our results highlight the GCW framework as a phenomenologically viable semiclassical model, offering testable predictions for upcoming gravitational wave and VLBI observations.</description>

      <title>On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the relativistic precession model of quasi-periodic oscillations through anharmonic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically reanalyze the relativistic precession model of quasi-periodic oscillations, exploring its natural extension beyond the standard harmonic approximation. To do so, we show that the perturbed geodesic equations must include anharmonic contributions arising from the higher-order expansion of the effective potential that cannot be neglected \emph{a priori}, as commonly done in all the approaches pursued so far. More specifically, independently of the underlying spacetime geometry, we find that in the radial sector the non-negligible anharmonic correction is quadratic in the radial displacement, i.e. $\propto \delta r^2$, and significantly affects the radial epicyclic frequency close to the innermost stable circular orbit. Conversely, polar oscillations $\delta \theta$ remain approximately decoupled from radial ones, preserving their independent dynamical behavior. To show the need of anharmonic corrections, we thus carry out Monte Carlo-Markov chain analyses on eight neutron star sources of quasi-periodic oscillations. Afterwards, we first work out the outcomes of the harmonic approximation in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild--de Sitter, and Kerr spacetimes. Subsequently, we apply the anharmonic corrections to them and use it to fit the aforementioned neutron star sources. Our findings indicate that the standard paradigm requires a systematic generalization to include the leading anharmonic corrections that appear physically necessary, although still insufficient to fully account for the observed phenomenology of quasi-periodic oscillations. Accordingly, we speculate on possible refinements of the relativistic precession model, showing the need to revise it at a fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Quantum induced shock dynamics in gravitational collapse: insights from effective models and numerical frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the formation and evolution of shock waves in spherically symmetric gravitational collapse within a Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) inspired effective framework. In this setting, the classical singularities are replaced by quantum-induced shell-crossing singularities, which are resolved through weak solutions such as shock waves. By formulating the dynamics in a generalized Painlev\'e--Gullstrand coordinate system, we derive a first-order partial differential equation that governs the propagation of the shock surface, while enforcing metric continuity via thin-shell junction conditions. To handle the non-trivial square-root structures and source terms that arise in these equations, we develop a novel numerical scheme capable of simulating quantum-corrected spacetime dynamics. Our results show that for small mass black holes near the Planck scale, the shock surface remains timelike and is shielded behind both inner and outer horizons. In the long-time limit, the shock accumulates the entire mass of the collapsing star. In contrast, for larger black hole masses, the shock surface develops spacelike segments, indicating a transition in the effective dynamics driven by quantum effects. The framework also reveals discontinuities in curvature invariants across the shock surface, which can be traced back to stress-energy redistributions caused by quantum effects. Overall, the proposed computational framework provides a general tool for modeling quantum-corrected gravitational collapse and offers new insights into black hole formations, singularity resolution, and the interplay between quantum geometry effects and effective spacetime structures.</description>

      <title>Non-Minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills Black Holes: Fundamental Quasinormal Mode and Grey-Body factors versus Outburst of Overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, an exact black hole solution in non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills theory was obtained, and its quasinormal modes were subsequently analyzed using the JWKB approximation \cite{Gogoi:2024vcx}. However, we demonstrate that this analysis lacks sufficient accuracy when studying modes with $\ell \leq n$, where $\ell$ is the multipole number and $n$ is the overtone number. To address this, we compute the quasinormal frequencies using the precise Leaver method. Our results show that while the fundamental mode deviates only slightly from the Schwarzschild value, the first few overtones exhibit significantly larger deviations, with the discrepancy growing rapidly with the overtone number. Moreover, beginning with the second overtone, we observe a striking phenomenon: the real part of the frequency tends to zero quickly as the non-minimal coupling constant increases. This combination of spectral stability in the fundamental mode and high sensitivity of the overtones suggests that the Yang-Mills contribution primarily deforms the metric in the near-horizon region, while the geometry quickly transitions back to a Schwarzschild-like form at larger radii. In addition, we compute the grey-body factors and confirm that they represent a more stable characteristic of the geometry, exhibiting a correspondence with quasinormal modes already at the first multipole. The Yang-Mills coupling enhances the grey-body factors, further increasing the transmission probability.</description>

      <title>Shadow curves and quasinormal modes for rotating black holes surrounded by dark matter, radiation and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of different fluid matter scenarios on the shadow of black holes (BH) and on frequencies of quasinormal modes (QNM) for a black hole subjected to scalar perturbations, with a comparison to the standard Kerr. The analysis of the shadow reveals a dependence on the density parameter of fluid matter $k$, with larger shadow sizes for larger values of $k$ in the dark matter and dust cases, while the shadow size becomes smaller in the radiation case. Notably, dark matter induces more visible deformations compared to radiation or dust, thereby highlighting its distinct imprint on shadow curves. We also find that dark matter reduces the real part of the QNM frequencies and significantly increases the damping time, enhancing the prospects for gravitational wave detection. The variations in spin parameter $a$, density parameter $k$ and multipole number $l$ are investigated. The analysis confirms the significant role of dark matter in modifying the behavior of QNMs, providing a promising avenue for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky (BFV), which produces a resolution of coisotropic reduction in terms of hamiltonian dg manifolds, to the case of nested coisotropic embeddings $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$. To this, we naturally assign $\underline{C}$ and $\underline{C_\circ}$, as well as the respective BFV dg manifolds. We show that the data of a nested coisotropic embedding defines a natural graded coisotropic embedding inside the BFV dg manifold assigned to $\underline{C}$, whose reduction can further be resolved using the BFV prescription. We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction" for a general class of nested coisotropic embeddings. We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}$, from the (graded) geometric quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold (when it exists), following the quantum BFV prescription. As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-minimal coupling in light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest ACT data release disfavors the attractor $n_s=1-2/N$. In inflationary models with nonminimal coupling, such attractors typically arise in the strong coupling limit. To align with observational constraints, we focus on nonminimal coupling models with small coupling constants. For the model with the coupling function $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi f(\phi)$ and the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda^2 f^2(\phi)$, we find that observational data constrain the parameters as $0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 35$ and $0 \lesssim k \lesssim 1.5$ for $f(\phi) = \phi^k$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. With the help of the nonmiminal coupling $\Omega(\phi) = 1 + \xi \phi^2$, the hilltop inflation and power-law inflation models with power indices $2/3$ and $1/3$ can be consistent with observational data within the $1\sigma$ range. We also give the viable parameter regions for $\xi$ for these three models.</description>

      <title>Insights into the highest natural scale: Finite naturalness challenges inflationary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the criterion of finite naturalness to the limiting case of a generic heavy sector decoupled from the Standard Model. The sole and unavoidable exception to this decoupling arises from gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that gravity can couple the Higgs to the heavy scale significantly earlier than the well-known three-loop top-quark-mediated diagrams discussed in previous literature. As an application, we show that finite naturalness disfavors large-field inflationary models involving super-Planckian field excursions. In contrast, in the small-field regime, achieving successful inflation requires substantial fine-tuning of the initial conditions, in agreement with previous results. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope further amplify the tension between naturalness and fine-tuning, challenging the theoretical robustness of single-field inflation as a compelling explanation for the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Inhomogeneous Perturbations of the Inflaton on the Cosmological Primordial Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of inhomogeneous inflaton perturbations on primordial magnetic fields within the framework of generalized inflationary magnetogenesis models. Extending the Ratra model to general spacetime backgrounds, we analyze the constraint structure of the electromagnetic field and demonstrate that the standard Coulomb gauge must be generalized to accommodate spatial inhomogeneities. Instead of the vector potential, we solve the conjugate momentum with the modified initial conditions introduced by the coupling function, which become dominant during the late stages of inflation. These change the conditions under which scale-invariant electromagnetic spectra are achieved. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating convolutions between vector potentials and inflaton perturbations by employing separate large- and small-scale approximations. The resulting influence to the electric and magnetic power spectra are quantified using $\Delta_E$ and $\Delta_B$, revealing a scale-dependent influence of inhomogeneities. We also find that the spectrum index evolution is sensitive to the sign of $V_{\phi}$, with distinctive behaviors for electric and magnetic fields under different scale-invariance conditions. Notably, for nearly scale-invariant magnetic fields, the perturbative effects shift the spectral index towards the red and migrate toward smaller scales as inflation progresses, offering a potential observational probe to differentiate between large-field and small-field inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>The equivalence between Einstein and Jordan frames: a study based on the inflationary magnetogenesis model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equivalence of the Jordan and Einstein frames has been a subject of considerable interest in the field. In this paper, within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, we explore the inflationary magnetogenesis model, focusing on the magnetic field energy density and its spectrum in both the Jordan and Einstein frames to elucidate the equivalence between these two reference frames. Our analysis reveals that during the inflationary epoch, while the magnetic field exhibits a scale-invariant spectrum in the Einstein frame, it demonstrates a blue spectrum in the Jordan frame. Additionally, we investigate the post-inflationary evolution of the magnetic field's energy density in both frames, uncovering that for scale-invariant spectra in the Einstein frame during inflation, the magnetic field transitions to a blue spectrum, whereas in the Jordan frame, it evolves into a red spectrum. We also establish the conditions under which both frames may exhibit scale-invariant spectra simultaneously during the inflationary period.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes are a unique probe of the early Universe and offer a potential link between inflationary dynamics and dark matter. In a recent work \cite{Inui:2024fgk}, we analyse PBH formation and the associated stochastic gravitational wave background from scalar induced gravitational waves, while taking into account the contributions from local non-Gaussianities.

      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of DESI DR2 BAO measurements in light of the latest ACT DR6 CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report cosmological results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) when combined with recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). By jointly analyzing ACT and {\it Planck} data and applying conservative cuts to overlapping multipole ranges, we assess how different {\it Planck}+ACT dataset combinations affect consistency with DESI. While ACT alone exhibits a tension with DESI exceeding 3$\sigma$ within the $\Lambda$CDM model, this discrepancy is reduced when ACT is analyzed in combination with {\it Planck}. For our baseline DESI DR2 BAO+{\it Planck} PR4+ACT likelihood combination, the preference for evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant is about 3$\sigma$, increasing to over 4$\sigma$ with the inclusion of Type Ia supernova data. While the dark energy results remain quite consistent across various combinations of {\it Planck} and ACT likelihoods with those obtained by the DESI collaboration, the constraints on neutrino mass are more sensitive, ranging from $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV in our baseline analysis, to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.077$ eV (95\% confidence level) in the CMB likelihood combination chosen by ACT when imposing the physical prior $\sum m_\nu&gt;0$ eV.</description>

      <title>Equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to derive equations of motion for dynamical systems with angular momentum on Finsler geometries. To this end, we apply Souriau's Principle of General Covariance, which is a geometrical framework to derive diffeomorphism invariant equations of motion. The equations we obtain are the generalization of that of Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) on Finsler geometries, and we give their conserved quantities which turn out to be formally identical to the Riemannian case.
  These equations share the same properties as the MPD equations, and we mention different choices possible for supplementary conditions to close this system of equations. These equations have an additional requirement, which is the choice of what defines the tangent direction of the Finsler manifold, since the velocity and momentum are not parallel in general. After choosing the momentum as the Finsler direction and to define the center of mass, we give the complete equations of motion in 3 spatial dimensions, which we find coincide to previously known equations for Finsler spinoptics, and novel equations in 4 dimensions for massive and massless dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave data analysis (GWDA) faces significant challenges due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and non-Gaussian, non-stationary artifacts in the interferometer background, which traditional methods have made significant progress in addressing but continue to face limitations. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) algorithms, offers potential advantages, including computational efficiency, scalability, and adaptability, which may complement traditional approaches in tackling these challenges more effectively. In this review, we explore AI-driven approaches to GWDA, covering every stage of the pipeline and presenting first explorations in waveform modeling and parameter estimation. This work represents the most comprehensive review to date, integrating the latest AI advancements with practical GWDA applications. Our meta-analysis reveals insights and trends, highlighting the transformative potential of AI in revolutionizing gravitational wave research and paving the way for future discoveries.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened new frontiers in understanding the cosmos, while the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in science promises to revolutionize data analysis methodologies. However, a significant gap exists, as there is currently no dedicated platform that enables scientists to develop, test, and evaluate AI algorithms efficiently for GW data analysis. To address this gap, we introduce GWAI, a pioneering AI-centered software platform designed for GW data analysis. GWAI contains a three-layered architecture that emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and flexibility, covering the entire analysis pipeline. GWAI aims to accelerate scientific discoveries, bridging the gap between advanced AI techniques and astrophysical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a cosmological reconstruction scheme in the background of f(Q) gravity theory from a Holographic perspective. The basic motivation for this work is that the reconstruction is performed from a holographic origin, which has its roots in the black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Dark energy models inspired by holographic prescription are used to reconstruct the f(Q) gravity models. Two such models, namely the Granda-Oliveros holographic dark energy model and its generalization, the Chen- Jing model are considered for the study. Different scale factors are used and a thorough reconstruction scheme is set up using the dark energy models. The observationally constrained values of the free model parameters have been used to form the reconstructed models. Finally, a thorough investigation of the energy conditions has been performed to check the cosmological viability of the reconstructed f(Q) models. As an outcome, we get some very promising and cosmologically viable f(Q) models that present some interesting properties and demand further investigation.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental element of scale-dependent gravity is the scale-setting procedure. We present a new covariant expression to set the scale that arises when examining the field equations. Considering the renormalization group equations and imposing energy-momentum tensor conservation, we arrive at two models of running of the gravitational and cosmological constants. In the cosmological setting, we found that in one model the Big Bang singularity is avoided, while in the other the Hubble tension can be alleviated. At the level of cosmological perturbations, we derived the basic solutions and qualitatively discussed the impacts of this scenario on structure formation.</description>

Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we first characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the spin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the tidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the gravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin quasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these finite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we find that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number $H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love number $\tilde{\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black holes with dimensionless spin $\chi \simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric spin-induced quadrupole moment $\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA observations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter constraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a Fisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network. The bounds on the tidal parameter $H_0$ and on $\tilde \Lambda$ are around two orders of magnitude better than the current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) bounds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational focusing and horizon entropy for higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, the Raychaudhuri equation and the focusing theorem in General Relativity were generalised to diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields on linearly perturbed Killing horizons. The Wall entropy can be extracted from the generalised focusing equation and it satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. In this paper, we further extend the discussion of gravitational focusing on the horizon to include arbitrary bosonic fields with spin $s \geq 2$. These higher-spin fields introduce indefinite terms into the generalised focusing equation, obstructing the proof of the focusing theorem and the existence of an increasing horizon entropy. To resolve this issue, we propose a higher-spin focusing condition that eliminates these indefinite terms, thereby restoring the focusing theorem and the associated thermodynamic laws. We speculate that the focusing condition could be a necessary condition for the physical consistency of higher-spin theories.</description>

      <title>Alternative LISA-TAIJI networks: Detectability of the Parity Violation in Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of parity violation in the isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) will serve a crucial probe for new physics, particularly in parity-violating theories of gravity. The joint observations by the planned space-borne gravitational wave detectors, LISA and TAIJI, will offer a unique opportunity to observe such effects in the millihertz (mHz) band. This study evaluates the detectability of parity violation in the SGWB using two network configurations: LISA-TAIJIp and LISA-TAIJIm. The former configuration consists of LISA (inclined at $+60^\circ$ relative to the ecliptic plane) and TAIJIp (also inclined at $+60^\circ$), while the latter network pairs LISA with TAIJIm (inclined at $-60^\circ$). Our analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of the LISA-TAIJIm network to parity violation in the SGWB is approximately one order of magnitude greater than that of the LISA-TAIJIp network at lower frequencies. To quantify the performance of the two networks, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratios for different spectral shapes, including power-law, single-peak, and broken power-law models, and estimate parameter determination using the Fisher information matrix. The results confirm that LISA-TAIJIm outperforms LISA-TAIJIp in detecting the SGWB with circular polarization components, offering a superior opportunity to test parity-violating gravitational constraints on various mechanisms in the mHz band.</description>

      <title>Cumulative effect of orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) have been proven to be a key feature for accurate gravitational-wave template modeling. Decades of research have led to schemes that can not only model the adiabatic inspiral of such a binary system, but also account for the effects of resonances on their evolution. In this work, we use an effective resonance model that includes analytically derived corrections to the radiation reaction fluxes, to study the combined effects of both dominant (low-order) and subdominant (high-order) orbital resonances in EMRIs. We show that using single, universal shifts for all fluxes overestimates the resonance impact, and therefore individualized shifts for each resonance crossing are needed for accurate modeling. Our analysis reveals that the cumulative effects from multiple resonance crossings can significantly impact the orbital evolution of EMRIs, especially for highly eccentric orbits. Our results provide further evidence that resonance effects have to be included in template production to extract detailed astrophysical parameters from EMRI signals.</description>

      <title>Active and Passive Conformal Transformations in Scalar-Tensor Gravitational Theories</title>

Abstract: Through considering the conformal transformations as coordinate transformations in some abstract space of fields, where the different fields are assumed as ``generalized coordinates,'' we introduce the notion of active and passive conformal transformations. We then apply both complementary approaches to the conformal frames issue, arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, in order to get better understanding of the problem. Special focus is on the coupling of matter fields to gravity. The recent result that the Lagrangian density of fundamental matter fields and perfect fluids, in its standard form, is not only conformal invariant but also conformal form-invariant, is taken into consideration in the discussion about the conformal frames issue.</description>

Abstract: Based on the recent result that the action of matter fields is conformal form-invariant in its standard form and on the active and passive approaches to conformal transformations, we review the conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories. We investigate whether this parametrization is actually different from other existing parametrizations. We also check the accuracy of the claim that the classical physical predictions of these theories are conformal-frame invariants.</description>

      <title>Topological defect formation in a phase transition with tunable order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the non-equilibrium dynamics and topological defect formation in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions. KZM has found applications in fields such as cosmology and condensed matter physics. However, it is generally not suitable for describing first-order phase transitions. It has been demonstrated that transitions in systems like superconductors or charged superfluids, typically classified as second-order, can exhibit weakly first-order characteristics when the influence of fluctuations is taken into account. Moreover, the order of the phase transition (i.e., the extent to which it becomes first rather than second order) can be tuned. We explore quench-induced formation of topological defects in such tunable phase transitions and propose that their density can be predicted by combining KZM with nucleation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research paper explores the interplay between quintessence and a cloud of strings, focusing on their influence on critical points, behaviors, and fractional-order phase transitions in AdS black holes. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings, with particular attention to the effects of thermal fluctuations on their thermodynamics. Using critical conditions, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the critical points applicable to all types of these black holes. We further study the impact of the quintessence parameter and the intensity of the cloud of strings on critical behaviors, employing three-dimensional visualizations to depict these effects for different values of \(\omega_q\). Our results show how these factors affect the locations of phase transitions and the regions where both phases coexist. In addition, we examine fractional-order phase transitions, which reveal significant transformations in the black hole system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Field in the $\kappa$-space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We also obtain expression for the $\kappa$-deformed gauge covariant derivative, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$. We show the compatibility between the $\kappa$-deformed field strength derived using Jacobi identity and the commutators of gauge covariant derivative, up to first order in $a$. The $\kappa$-deformed field strength is covariant under $SU(N)$ gauge transformations as the $a$-dependent corrections come with overall multiplicative factors only, that is $\hat{F}^a_{0i} =F^a_{0i} (1-\frac{ap_0}{\hbar})$ and $\hat{F}^a_{ij} = F^a_{ij} (1-\frac{2ap_0}{\hbar})$, where $F^{a}_{\mu \nu}$ is the field strength in the commutative space-time. We found that the $a$-dependent term in the deformed Wong's equation does not contribute to the modification of Yang-Mills equation, up to first order in $a$. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under $SU(N)$ transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>Testing local position invariance with odd multipoles of galaxy clustering statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological constraints on local position invariance (LPI), a key aspect of the Einstein equivalence principle (EEP), through asymmetric galaxy clustering. The LPI asserts that the outcomes of the non-gravitational experiments are identical regardless of location in spacetime and has been tested through measurements of the gravitational redshift effect. Therefore, measuring the gravitational redshift effect encoded in galaxy clustering provides a powerful and novel cosmological probe of the LPI. Recent work by Saga et al. proposed its validation using the cross-correlation function between distinct galaxy samples, but their analysis focused solely on the dipole moment. In this paper, we extend their work by further analyzing a higher-order odd multipole moment, the octupole moment, in the constraints on the LPI-violating parameter, $\alpha$, expected from galaxy surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, Euclid space telescope, Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph, and Square Kilometre Array. We demonstrate that combining the octupole and dipole moments significantly improves the constraints, particularly when the analysis is restricted to larger scales, characterized by a large minimum separation $s_{\rm min}$. For a conservative setup with $s_{\rm min}=15 {\rm Mpc}/h$, we find an average improvement of 11$\%$ compared to using the dipole moment alone. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipoles in constraining $\alpha$, providing a more robust approach to testing the EEP on cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of local features in the inflationary potential on the preheating dynamics after inflation. We show that a small feature in the potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one. Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables. We demonstrate that these features effectively introduce localized higher-power terms in the potential, significantly influencing the preheating dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$ a phenomenon we term potential surge preheating. We outline the resulting modifications in energy distribution among different components. We further show that these small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, offering a way to reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales. Finally, we argue that these modifications to the scalar potential provide a framework to explore preheating dynamics and the fragmentation of scalar fields using simple scalar potentials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density $\rho \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description, obtaining a novel form of the corresponding linearized stress tensor. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton amplitude for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effects -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>
