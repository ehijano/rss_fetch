      <title>Self-orthogonal and self-dual codes from maximal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of algebraic geometric codes (AG codes), the characterization of dual codes has long been a challenging problem which relies on differentials. In this paper, we provide some descriptions for certain differentials utilizing algebraic structure of finite fields and geometric properties of algebraic curves. Moreover, we construct self-orthogonal and self-dual codes with parameters $[n, k, d]_{q^2}$ satisfying $k + d$ is close to $n$. Additionally, quantum codes with large minimum distance are also constructed.</description>

      <title>Embracing Reconfigurable Antennas in the Tri-hybrid MIMO Architecture for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing system power consumption to rise as a result. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adding new layer for signal processing. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We also discuss several design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.</description>

      <title>Bridging Neural Networks and Wireless Systems with MIMO-OFDM Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications aim to enhance transmission efficiency by jointly optimizing source coding, channel coding, and modulation. While prior research has demonstrated promising performance in simulations, real-world implementations often face significant challenges, including noise variability and nonlinear distortions, leading to performance gaps. This article investigates these challenges in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based semantic communication system, focusing on the practical impacts of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) variations. Our analysis identifies frequency selectivity of the actual channel as a critical factor in performance degradation and demonstrates that targeted mitigation strategies can enable semantic systems to approach theoretical performance. By addressing key limitations in existing designs, we provide actionable insights for advancing semantic communications in practical wireless environments. This work establishes a foundation for bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world deployment, highlighting essential considerations for system design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion under Neural Tracking of Speech: A Directed Redundancy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data acquired at different scalp EEG electrodes when human subjects are exposed to speech stimuli are highly redundant. The redundancy is partly due to volume conduction effects and partly due to localized regions of the brain synchronizing their activity in response to the stimuli. In a competing talker scenario, we use a recent measure of directed redundancy to assess the amount of redundant information that is causally conveyed from the attended stimuli to the left temporal region of the brain. We observe that for the attended stimuli, the transfer entropy as well as the directed redundancy is proportional to the correlation between the speech stimuli and the reconstructed signal from the EEG signals.
  This demonstrates that both the rate as well as the rate-redundancy are inversely proportional to the distortion in neural speech tracking. Thus, a greater rate indicates a greater redundancy between the electrode signals, and a greater correlation between the reconstructed signal and the attended stimuli. A similar relationship is not observed for the distracting stimuli.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise Resilient Codebook Design for Sparse Code Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a promising technique for future machine type communication systems due to its superior spectral efficiency and capability for supporting massive connectivity. This paper proposes a novel class of sparse codebooks to improve the error rate performance of SCMA in the presence of phase noise (PN). Specifically, we first analyze the error rate performance of SCMA impaired by looking into the pair-wise error probability. Then, a novel codebook design metric, called minimum PN metric (MPNM), is proposed. In addition, to design PN resilient codebooks, we propose a novel pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM)-based low projection mother constellation (LP-MC), called LP-PAM. The codebooks for different users are obtained by rotating and scaling the MC, where the phase rotation angles and scaling factors for different users are optimized by maximizing the proposed MPNM. Numerical results show that the proposed PNCBs have larger MPNM values and achieve improved error rate performance than the-state-of-the-art codebooks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$, for a prime power $q$, in this paper we present a way of constructing spreads of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. They will arise as orbits under the action of an Abelian non-cyclic group. First, we construct a family of orbit codes of maximum distance using this group, and then we complete each of these codes to achieve a spread of the whole space having an orbital structure.</description>

      <title>Covert Adversarial Actuators in Finite MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Markov decision process (MDP) in which actions prescribed by the controller are executed by a separate actuator, which may behave adversarially. At each time step, the controller selects and transmits an action to the actuator; however, the actuator may deviate from the intended action to degrade the control reward. Given that the controller observes only the sequence of visited states, we investigate whether the actuator can covertly deviate from the controller's policy to minimize its reward without being detected. We establish conditions for covert adversarial behavior over an infinite time horizon and formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal adversarial policy under these conditions. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic error exponents for detection in two scenarios: (1) a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the actuator either follows the prescribed policy or a known adversarial strategy, and (2) a composite hypothesis testing framework, where the actuator may employ any stationary policy. For the latter case, we also propose an optimization problem to maximize the adversary's performance.</description>

      <title>On Oblivious Transfer Capacity of Noisy Multiple Access Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of Oblivious Transfer (OT) over a noisy Multiple Access Channel (MAC) involving two non-colluding senders and a single receiver. The channel model is characterized by correlations among the parties, with the parties assumed to be either honest-but-curious or, in the receiver's case, potentially malicious. We propose a multiparty protocol for honest-but-curious parties where the general MAC is reduced to a certain correlation. In scenarios where the receiver is malicious, the protocol achieves an achievable rate region.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Capacity of Byzantine Symmetric Private Information Retrieval and Its Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the asymptotic capacity of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with $B$ Byzantine servers. Prior to finding the capacity, a definition for the Byzantine servers is needed since in the literature there are two different definitions. In \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where it was first defined, the Byzantine servers can send any symbol from the storage, their received queries and some independent random symbols. In \cite{unresponsive_byzantine_1}, Byzantine servers send any random symbol independently of their storage and queries. It is clear that these definitions are not identical, especially when \emph{symmetric} privacy is required. To that end, we define Byzantine servers, inspired by \cite{byzantine_tpir}, as the servers that can share everything, before and after the scheme initiation. In this setting, we find an upper bound, for an infinite number of messages case, that should be satisfied for all schemes that protect against this setting and develop a scheme that achieves this upper bound. Hence, we identify the capacity of the problem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>Distributional Information Embedding: A Framework for Multi-bit Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel problem, distributional information embedding, motivated by the practical demands of multi-bit watermarking for large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional information embedding, which embeds information into a pre-existing host signal, LLM watermarking actively controls the text generation process--adjusting the token distribution--to embed a detectable signal. We develop an information-theoretic framework to analyze this distributional information embedding problem, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs among three critical performance metrics: text quality, detectability, and information rate. In the asymptotic regime, we demonstrate that the maximum achievable rate with vanishing error corresponds to the entropy of the LLM's output distribution and increases with higher allowable distortion. We also characterize the optimal watermarking scheme to achieve this rate. Extending the analysis to the finite-token case, we identify schemes that maximize detection probability while adhering to constraints on false alarm and distortion.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems.

      <title>Information Decomposition Diagrams Applied beyond Shannon Entropy: A Generalization of Hu's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09393v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information theory, one major goal is to find useful functions that summarize the amount of information contained in the interaction of several random variables. Specifically, one can ask how the classical Shannon entropy, mutual information, and higher interaction information relate to each other. This is answered by Hu's theorem, which is widely known in the form of information diagrams: it relates shapes in a Venn diagram to information functions, thus establishing a bridge from set theory to information theory. In this work, we view random variables together with the joint operation as a monoid that acts by conditioning on information functions, and entropy as a function satisfying the chain rule of information. This abstract viewpoint allows to prove a generalization of Hu's theorem. It applies to Shannon and Tsallis entropy, (Tsallis) Kullback-Leibler Divergence, cross-entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, submodular information functions, and the generalization error in machine learning. Our result implies for Chaitin's Kolmogorov complexity that the interaction complexities of all degrees are in expectation close to Shannon interaction information. For well-behaved probability distributions on increasing sequence lengths, this shows that the per-bit expected interaction complexity and information asymptotically coincide, thus showing a strong bridge between algorithmic and classical information theory.</description>

      <title>Broadcast Channels with Heterogeneous Arrival and Decoding Deadlines: Second-Order Achievability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard assumption in the design of ultra-reliable low-latency communication systems is that the duration between message arrivals is larger than the number of channel uses before the decoding deadline. Nevertheless, this assumption fails when messages arrive rapidly and reliability constraints require that the number of channel uses exceed the time between arrivals. In this paper, we consider a broadcast setting in which a transmitter wishes to send two different messages to two receivers over Gaussian channels. Messages have different arrival times and decoding deadlines such that their transmission windows overlap. For this setting, we propose a coding scheme that exploits Marton's coding strategy. We derive rigorous bounds on the achievable rate regions. Those bounds can be easily employed in point-to-point settings with one or multiple parallel channels. In the point-to-point setting with one or multiple parallel channels, the proposed achievability scheme is consistent with the normal approximation. In the broadcast setting, our scheme agrees with Marton's strategy for sufficiently large numbers of channel uses and shows significant performance improvements over standard approaches based on time sharing for transmission of short packets.</description>

      <title>Radon-Hurwitz Grassmannian codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every equi-isoclinic tight fusion frame (EITFF) is a type of optimal code in a Grassmannian, consisting of subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space for which the smallest principal angle between any pair of them is as large as possible. EITFFs yield dictionaries with minimal block coherence and so are ideal for certain types of compressed sensing. By refining classical work of Lemmens and Seidel based on Radon-Hurwitz theory, we fully characterize EITFFs in the special case where the dimension of the subspaces is exactly one-half of that of the ambient space. We moreover show that each such "Radon-Hurwitz EITFF" is highly symmetric, where every even permutation is an automorphism.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Joint Detection and Decoding on the Binary-Input AWGN Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For asynchronous transmission of short blocks, preambles for packet detection contribute a non-negligible overhead. To reduce the required preamble length, joint detection and decoding (JDD) techniques have been proposed that additionally utilize the payload part of the packet for detection. In this paper, we analyze two instances of JDD, namely hybrid preamble and energy detection (HyPED) and decoder-aided detection (DAD). While HyPED combines the preamble with energy detection for the payload, DAD also uses the output of a channel decoder. For these systems, we propose novel achievability and converse bounds for the rates over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Moreover, we derive a general bound on the required blocklength for JDD. Both the theoretical bound and the simulation of practical codebooks show that the rate of DAD quickly approaches that of synchronous transmission.</description>

      <title>Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided Asymmetric MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Codes for General Phased Burst Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phased burst errors (PBEs) are bursts of errors occurring at one or more known locations. The correction of PBEs is a classical topic in coding theory, with prominent applications such as the design of array codes for memory systems or distributed storage. We propose a general yet fine-grained approach to this problem, accounting not only for the number of bursts but also the error structure in each burst. By modeling PBEs as an error set in an adversarial channel, we investigate bounds on the maximal size of codes that can correct them. The PBE-correction capability of generalized concatenated codes is analyzed, and asymptotically good PBE-correcting codes are constructed, recovering a classical construction in a specific problem instance.</description>

      <title>Bowen's equations for invariance pressure of control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to establish Bowen's equations for upper capacity invariance pressure and Pesin-Pitskel invariance pressure of discrete-time control systems. We first introduce a new invariance pressure called induced invariance pressure on partitions that specializes the upper capacity invariance pressure on partitions, and then show that the two types of invariance pressures are related by a Bowen's equation. Besides, to establish Bowen's equation for Pesin-Pitskel invariance pressure on partitions we also introduce a new notion called BS invariance dimension on subsets. Moreover, a variational principle for BS invariance dimension on subsets is established.</description>

      <title>A max filtering local stability theorem with application to weighted phase retrieval and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an inner product space $V$ and a group $G$ of linear isometries, max filtering offers a rich class of convex $G$-invariant maps. In this paper, we identify sufficient conditions under which these maps are locally lower Lipschitz on $R(G)$, the set of orbits with maximal dimension, with respect to the quotient metric on the orbit space $V/G$. Central to our proof is a desingularization theorem, which applies to open, dense neighborhoods around each orbit in $R(G)/G$ and may be of independent interest.
  As an application, we provide guarantees for stable weighted phase retrieval. That is, we construct componentwise convex bilipschitz embeddings of weighted complex (resp.\ quaternionic) projective spaces. These spaces arise as quotients of direct sums of nontrivial unitary irreducible complex (resp.\ quaternionic) representations of the group of unit complex numbers $S^1\cong \operatorname{SO}(2)$ (resp.\ unit quaternions $S^3\cong \operatorname{SU}(2)$).
  We also discuss the relevance of such embeddings to a nearest-neighbor problem in single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a leading technique for resolving the spatial structure of biological molecules.</description>
