      <title>Data-driven Approach for Interpolation of Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of hadron resonances and their properties are limited by the accuracy and consistency of measured datasets, which can originate from many different experiments. We have used Gaussian Processes (GP) to build interpolated datasets, including quantification of uncertainties, so that data from different sources can be used in model fitting without the need for arbitrary weighting. GPs predict values and uncertainties of observables at any kinematic point. Bayesian inference is used to optimise the hyperparameters of the GP model. We demonstrate that the GP successfully interpolates data with quantified uncertainties by comparison with generated pseudodata. We also show that this methodology can be used to investigate the consistency of data from different sources. GPs provide a robust, model-independent method for interpolating typical datasets used in hadron resonance studies, removing the limitations of arbitrary weighting in sparse datasets.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Investigation of the Aeroelastic Interaction between Transonic Buffet and Structural Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transonic shock buffet is a nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon characterized by self-sustained, periodic shock oscillations that can critically affect aircraft structural integrity. While the aerodynamic aspects of shock buffet have been widely studied, its interaction with nonlinear structural dynamics remains largely unexplored. This paper presents, for the first time, a numerical investigation of aeroelastic interactions arising from the coupling of shock buffet with a nonlinear structural model featuring pitch freeplay. Using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations coupled with a two-degree-of-freedom heave-pitch airfoil model, the study reveals that structural nonlinearity can induce aerodynamic lock-in to superharmonics of the heave natural frequency, resulting in 2:1 and 3:1 resonance mechanisms and large-amplitude heave limit cycles. These newly identified resonance behaviors expand the current understanding of transonic aeroelastic instabilities. The influence of key parameters such as structural-to-fluid mass ratio and structural damping on these phenomena is also systematically examined. This work introduces a novel class of aeroelastic lock-in mechanisms with significant implications for transonic flight dynamics and aircraft design.</description>

      <title>Statistics within UV-Visible Absorption Spectrum of Ethanolic Azobenzene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a statistical simulation of the UV-visible absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene in ethanol solution. Due to intermolecular interactions, the used explicit solvent environment necessitates accounting for numerous transitions for a spectrum covering the two energetically lowest lines, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the spectrum manifests vast variation as a function of the underlying local structure, in conjunction with previous observations for spectra of liquids in the X-ray regime. We disentangle the complex structure-spectrum relationship using a machine learning-based method known as the emulator-based component analysis. This structural decomposition outperforms commonly used principal component analysis in explained spectral variation and reveals a small subset of latent structural variables responsible for the total spectral variance. Among other structural characteristics, blueshifting of the S2 line occurs with fewer hydrogen bonds with the ethanol solvent, and a contracted N-N bond within the C-N=N-C bridge. The observed structural dependence of the absorption spectrum thus implies an overrepresentation of certain structural classes after a photoexcitation, potentially significant for the subsequent nuclear dynamics, photophysics, and photochemistry.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMT) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments, gains acceleration on GPUs and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs with jumbo-charge outputs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the long-serving method of waveform integration.</description>
