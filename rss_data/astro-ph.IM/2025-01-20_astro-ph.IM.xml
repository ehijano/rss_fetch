      <title>Galaxy Morphological Classification with Zernike Moments and Machine Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying galaxies is an essential step for studying their structures and dynamics. Using GalaxyZoo2 (GZ2) fractions thresholds, we collect 545 and 11,735 samples in non-galaxy and galaxy classes, respectively. We compute the Zernike moments (ZMs) for GZ2 images, extracting unique and independent characteristics of galaxies. The uniqueness due to the orthogonality and completeness of Zernike polynomials, reconstruction of the original images with minimum errors, invariances (rotation, translation, and scaling), different block structures, and discriminant decision boundaries of ZMs' probability density functions for different order numbers indicate the capability of ZMs in describing galaxy features. We classify the GZ2 samples, firstly into the galaxies and non-galaxies and secondly, galaxies into spiral, elliptical, and odd objects (e.g., ring, lens, disturbed, irregular, merger, and dust lane). The two models include the support vector machine (SVM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), which use ZMs, compared with the other three classification models of 2D-CNN, ResNet50, and VGG16 that apply the features from original images. We find the true skill statistic (TSS) greater than 0.86 for the SVM and 1D-CNN with ZMs for the oversampled galaxy-non-galaxy classifier. The SVM with ZMs model has a high-performance classification for galaxy and non-galaxy datasets. We show that the SVM with ZMs, 1D-CNN with ZMs, and VGG16 with vision transformer are high-performance (accuracy larger than 0.90 and TSS greater than 0.86) models for classifying the galaxies into spiral, elliptical, and odd objects. We conclude that these machine-learning algorithms are helpful tools for classifying galaxy images.</description>

      <title>Intensity Interferometer Results on Sirius with 0.25 m Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the successful measurement of the squared visibility of Sirius at a telescope separation of 3.3 m using small 0.25 m Newtonian-style telescopes in an urban backyard setting. The primary science goal for small-scale intensity interferometers has been to measure the angular diameters of stars. Recent advances in low jitter time-tagging equipment and Single Photon Avalanche Detectors have made the detection of second-order photon correlation signals feasible with small low-cost telescopes. Using Sirius as a target star, we observe a photon count rate of $\sim$1.9 Mcps per detector with matched 1.2 nm wide filters at 589.3 nm and measured the spatial squared visibility at a telescope separation of 3.3 m to be $|V_{12}(3.3\text{m})|^2 = 0.94\pm0.16$. The measured detection significance is $\sim7 \sigma$ after 13.55 h of integration. The uncertainty in the measured visibility includes uncertainty in the instrument response function.The squared visibility agrees closely with the expected value of $0.94\pm0.01$. These results demonstrate that using small low-cost telescopes is feasible for intensity interferometry of bright stars. This enables a simple scaling in sensitivity by further realistic improvements in the instrument response jitter as well as increasing both the number of spectral bands and the number of telescopes towards systems capable of resolving objects such as quasars, white dwarfs, and galactic Cepheid variable stars.</description>

      <title>ELLIPSECT: A surface brightness analysis tool for GALFIT 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EllipSect is a user-friendly Python analysis tool that generates publication quality figures from the output of GALFIT 3, a popular galaxy surface brightness 2D-fitting algorithm. EllipSect allows the direct analysis of GALFIT 3 preliminary modeling, to guide optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, EllipSect generates non-parametric measurements of some useful parameters that are not provided by GALFIT 3, such as the effective radius resulting from multi-component fits, cusp radius, and the Petrosian radius. This paper provides examples and a quick guide for EllipSect.</description>

      <title>On the seismic modelling of subgiant stars: testing different grid interpolation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The emergence of mixed modes during the subgiant phase, whose frequencies are characterized by a fast evolution with age, can potentially enable a precise determination of stellar properties, a key goal for future missions like PLATO. However, current modelling techniques often consider grids that lack the resolution to properly account for the fast mode frequency evolution, consequently requiring the use of interpolation algorithms to cover the parameter space in between the grid models when applying model-data comparison methods. Aims. We aim at reproducing the $\ell$=1 mode frequencies within the accuracy limits associated with the typical observational errors ($\sim$0.1 $\mu$Hz) through interpolation on a grid of subgiant models. Methods. With that aim, we used variations of a two-step interpolation algorithm, which considered linear and cubic splines interpolation methods and different age proxies (physical age, scaled age, and central density). Results. The best results were obtained using an algorithm that considers cubic splines interpolation along tracks, linear interpolation across tracks, and central density $\rho_\text{c}$ as the age proxy. This combination yielded, on average, an absolute error of 0.14 $\mu$Hz, but reached maximum absolute errors on the interpolated frequencies of 1.2 $\mu$Hz for some models, which is an order of magnitude higher than the typical observational errors. Furthermore, we investigated the impact on the accuracy of the interpolation from changes in the physical properties of the stars, showing, in particular, how the addition of core overshoot can affect significantly the interpolation results.</description>

      <title>Identification of 4876 Bent-Tail Radio Galaxies in the FIRST Survey Using Deep Learning Combined with Visual Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bent-tail radio galaxies (BTRGs) are characterized by bent radio lobes. This unique shape is mainly caused by the movement of the galaxy within a cluster, during which the radio jets are deflected by the intra-cluster medium. A combined method, which involves a deep learning-based radio source finder along with visual inspection, has been utilized to search for BTRGs from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters survey images. Consequently, a catalog of 4876 BTRGs has been constructed, among which 3871 are newly discovered. Based on the classification scheme of the opening angle between the two jets of the galaxy, BTRGs are typically classified as either wide-angle-tail (WAT) sources or narrow-angle-tail (NAT) sources. Our catalog comprises 4424 WATs and 652 NATs. Among these, optical counterparts are identified for 4193 BTRGs. This catalog covers luminosities in the range of $1.91\times10^{20} \leq L_{\rm 1.4\,GHz} \leq 1.45\times10^{28}$ ${\rm W\,Hz^{-1}}$ and redshifts from $z = 0.0023$ to $z = 3.43$. Various physical properties of these BTRGs and their statistics are presented. Particularly, by the nearest neighbor method, we found that 1825 BTRGs in this catalog belong to galaxy clusters reported in literature.</description>

      <title>The promise of deep-stacking for neutrino astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube has opened new windows for neutrino astronomy, but their sources remains largely unresolved. We study a methodology to address this - deep-stacking - that exploits correlations between observed neutrinos and comprehensive catalogs of potential source populations, including faint, high-redshift sources. By stacking signals from numerous weak sources and optimizing source weighting, significant gains in sensitivity can be achieved, particularly in the low-background regime where individual high-energy neutrinos dominate. We provide a semi-analytic framework to estimate sensitivity improvements for populations of sources under various background scenarios and redshift evolutions. Our analysis demonstrates that deep-stacking can increase detection sensitivity by a factor of 3 to 5, enabling detailed population studies. Furthermore, we discuss the potential to resolve the diffuse neutrino flux and investigate the redshift evolution of source populations. This approach offers a direct path toward identifying the primary sites of cosmic-ray acceleration and the mechanisms responsible for high-energy neutrino production.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for extracting tidal information from neutron star binary mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Modular global-fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We anticipate that the data acquired by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be dominated by the gravitational wave signals from several astrophysical populations. The analysis of these data is a new challenge and is the main focus of this paper. Numerous gravitational wave signals overlap in the time and/or frequency domain, and the possible correlation between them has to be taken into account during their detection and characterization. In this work, we present a method to address the LISA data analysis challenge; it is flexible and scalable for a number of sources and across several populations. Its performance is demonstrated on the simulated data LDC2a.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysics demands higher precision in measurements across photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry. Several science cases necessitate not only precision but also a high level of accuracy. We highlight the challenges involved, particularly in achieving spectral fidelity, which refers to our ability to accurately replicate the input spectrum of an astrophysical source. Beyond wavelength calibration, this encompasses correcting observed spectra for atmospheric, telescope, and instrumental signatures. Elevating spectral fidelity opens avenues for addressing fundamental questions in physics and astrophysics. We delve into specific science cases, critically analyzing the prerequisites for conducting crucial observations. Special attention is given to the requirements for spectrograph detectors, their calibrations and data reduction. Importantly, these considerations align closely with the needs of photometry and astrometry.</description>

      <title>The Radio Fundamental Catalogue. I. Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an all-sky catalog of absolute positions and estimates of correlated flux density of 21,942 compact radio sources determined from processing interferometric visibility data of virtually all very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observing sessions at 2-23 GHz from 72 programs suitable for absolute astrometry collected for 30 years. We used a novel technique of generation of a data set of fused observables that allowed us to incorporate all available data in our analysis. The catalog is the most complete and most precise to date. It forms the foundation and reference for positional astronomy, space geodesy, space navigation, and population analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and provides calibrators for phase referencing for differential astrometry and VLBI astrophysical observations. Its accuracy was evaluated through a detailed accounting of systematic errors, rigorous decimation tests, comparison of different data sets, and comparison with other catalogs. The catalog preferentially samples AGNs with strong contemporary parsec-scale synchrotron emission. Its milliarcsecond-level positional accuracy allows association of these AGNs with detections in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio to gamma-rays and high-energy neutrinos. We describe the innovative data processing and calibration technique in full detail, report the in depth analysis of random and systematic positional errors, and provide a list of associations with large surveys at different wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. The previous letter in this series describes our project and associated TRON pipeline designed to mine archival MeerKAT data for transient and variable sources. In this letter, we report on a new transient, a radio flare, associated with Gaia DR3 6865945581361480448, a G type star, whose parallax places it at a distance of 1334 pc. Its duration and high degree of circular polarization suggests electron cyclotron maser instability as the mechanism, consistent with an RS CVn variable.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasars discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>
