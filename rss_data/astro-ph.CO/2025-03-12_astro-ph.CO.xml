      <title>Faster than SAM: An empirical model for the tidal evolution of dark matter substructure around strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses enable direct inference of halo abundance and internal structure, which in turn enable constraints on the nature of dark matter and the primordial matter power spectrum. However, the density profiles of dark subhalos around the main deflector of a strong lens system also depend on tidal evolution inside the host, complicating the interpretation of strong-lensing inferences. We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that accurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally-stripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector for a variety of dark matter models. This model matches predictions from the semi-analytic model (SAM) {\tt{galacticus}}, but enables the simulation of subhalo populations in seconds, rather than hours. We use this model to examine the expected number of subhalos near the Einstein radius of a typical lens, and examine their lensing signals. We show that in cold dark matter the amplitude of the bound mass function is suppressed by a factor of $20$ relative to the infall mass function, and $87 \%$ of subhalos appearing in projection near the Einstein radius of a typical strong lensing deflector have lost more than $80\%$ of their mass since infall. Tidal stripping becomes increasingly severe in dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, such as warm dark matter. This model will be used to forward model subhalo populations in forthcoming analyses of strong lens systems.</description>

      <title>Excursion Sets with a "Perfect" Collapse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts structure formation across a vast mass range, from massive clusters ($\sim10^{15}\,\text{M}_\odot$) to Earth-mass micro-haloes ($\sim 10^{-6} \, \text{M}_\odot$), resolving which far exceeds the capabilities of current simulations. Excursion set models are the most efficient theoretical tool to disentangle this hierarchy in mass. We test the excursion set paradigm by combining smoothed initial density fields with a "perfect" collapse model -- $N$-body simulations. We find that a core excursion set assumption -- small-scale perturbations do not impact larger-scale collapse -- is approximately fulfilled but exhibits small quantitative violations dependent on the smoothing filter. For a sharp $k-$space cut-off $\sim 20\%$ of mass elements revert collapse as the smoothing scale decreases, while only $3.5\%$ do for a Gaussian and $5\%$ for a top-hat. Further, we test the simple deterministic mass-mapping $M \propto R^3$ (first-crossing scale to halo mass) relation. We find that particles that are first accreted into haloes at the same smoothing scale may end up in haloes of significantly different masses, with a scatter of 0.4-0.8 dex. We also demonstrate that the proportionally constant of this relation should be considered as a degree of freedom. Finally, we measure the mass fraction in different structure morphologies (voids, pancakes, filaments and haloes) as a function of filter scale. Typical particles appear to be part of a large-scale pancake, a smaller-scale filament and a notably smaller halo. We conclude that validating predictions of excursion set models on a particle-by-particle basis against simulations may enhance their realism.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Cosmic Neutrino Background Capture on Astrophysical Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic background are captured by objects in the sky that contain material susceptible of single beta decay. Neutrons, which compose most of a neutron star, capture low-energy neutrinos from the cosmic neutrino background and release a high-energy electron in the MeV range. Also, planets contain unstable isotopes that capture the cosmic neutrinos. We show that this process is feasible and results in a non-negligible flux of electrons in the MeV range in neutron stars. We present a novel observable, the redshift evolution of the temperature of neutron stars due to neutrino capture, that could provide a route for detection of the cosmic neutrino background from future gravitational waves observatories. For planets the flux is significantly smaller and a measurement is not possible with currently envisioned technology. While the signature from neutron stars is small and challenging, it could result in a novel way to detect the cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>The Spectroscopic Stage-5 Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational cosmology has provided an extraordinary perspective on our universe and our place within it. However, as our understanding of the universe has increased, some glaring holes in our knowledge have become apparent: What physics is responsible for the super-luminal expansion of the universe at early times? What drives the accelerating expansion of the universe at late times? What is the nature of the mysterious dark matter that makes up 83\% of the matter in the universe? These fundamental physical questions are intimately linked to fundamental astronomical questions about how galaxies and stars have formed and evolved within our universe. Cosmic surveys are the primary means by which we study the origin, structure, composition, and evolution of our universe. In particular, many of these questions require the spectroscopy of large numbers of astronomical sources. Spectroscopy provides key data on the physics of primordial inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration, the astrophysics of galaxy evolution, and the nature and effects of dark matter in galaxies. For example, observable features in the three-dimensional structure of the universe are key predictions of cosmological models, and their time evolution provides unique constraints on the nature of dark energy, inflation and the gravitational effects of dark matter. The next major advance in our understanding of the universe requires spectroscopic measurements of hundreds of millions of astronomical objects.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hubble constant using standard sirens and reconstructed matter density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarise a new approach for measuring the Hubble constant using standard sirens and the reconstructed matter density field obtained from observed galaxy surveys. Specifically, we describe and test this method using the Bayesian forward-modelled software BORG. This software evolves the initial density field to the present, sampling plausible density fields from the posterior, accounting for peculiar velocities, and automatically incorporating higher-order correlation functions. The advantage of adding additional information from correlations is expected to make this method more effective in low-signal-to-noise regimes, such as those with modest galaxy number density or incomplete surveys. Our results show that developing a cross-correlation framework between gravitational waves and galaxy surveys, based on the forward-modelled reconstructed density field, to measure H0 is promising. This review is based on the research conducted as part of Boruah's Ph.D. thesis.</description>

      <title>Observational Viability of Anisotropic Inflation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic inflation within the single-field model featuring an intermediate scale factor. Our analysis reveals that the anisotropic nature of the Friedmann equations in this framework affects the slow-roll parameters, which in turn influence key perturbation parameters. Using a numerical approach, we derive constraints on the intermediate parameter $\beta$ and the anisotropic parameter $c$. Our results show that the model is consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK14+BAO data at $68\%$ CL, for $0.84&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.34&lt;c&lt;27.7$. At $95\%$ CL the consistency holds for $0.77&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.17&lt;c&lt;28.9$. The model is also consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE +lowE+lensing+BK18+BAO data, for $0.91&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $8.00&lt;c&lt;27.4$ (at $68\%$ CL), and $0.88&lt;\beta&lt;1$ and $7.40&lt;c&lt;28.8$ (at $95\%$ CL). Additionally, we examine the reheating phase using these constraints on constraints on $\beta$ and $c$ and determine the observationally consistent ranges for the number of e-folds and the temperature during the reheating phase.</description>

      <title>Utilizing localized fast radio bursts to constrain their progenitors and the expansion history of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological applications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The increasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion measure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample of 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering timescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the DM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the FRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both high and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with about 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the two scenarios at 4$\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to be related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the progenitors. Using our inferred host galaxy DMs, we are able to rule out (at 95 percent confidence) a majority of localized FRB progenitors originating from young sources with stellar ages less than 10 Myr. This might reflect a large population of old sources or an observational bias against detecting FRBs from young sources, which may be associated with long scatter broadening times and large DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter broadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the same time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or with the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that scattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.</description>

      <title>On the Uncertainties of Galaxy Distances from Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systemic velocity or redshift of galaxies is a convenient tool to calculate their distances in the absence of primary methods, but the uncertainties on these flow distances may be substantial due to galaxy peculiar motions. Here, we derive a simple and easily applicable method to assign uncertainties to flow distances from four different methodologies, namely the Hubble law with both heliocentric and local-sheet velocities, the Cosmicflows-4 model, and the Numerical Action Methods model. Our uncertainty scheme is derived by comparing these flow distances to accurate, redshift-independent distances of a subsample of ~2000 galaxies from the Cosmicflows-4 database, using the tip magnitude of the red giant branch, Cepheids, surface brightness fluctuations, supernovae type Ia, masers, and supernovae type II. We provide simple functions and tables to calculate the distance uncertainties for all the flow models considered. This uncertainty scheme is generally applicable except for the region around the Virgo cluster, where we assign increased uncertainties due to larger peculiar motions.</description>

      <title>Spectral distortion and polarization of the cosmic microwave background: Measurement, challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a fundamental observational tool in modern cosmology. The linear polarization of the CMB provides a crucial observational tool for exploring new physics, including the inflationary paradigm and parity-violating phenomena. The spectral distortion of the CMB can be used as a probe of the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (GCs) and to infer cosmological parameters. However, precise measurements are limited by foreground contamination and instrumental systematics.
  This work examines the non-thermal energy budget in GCs with the non-thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (ntSZ) effect. Using $Planck$ all-sky maps, we measure the ntSZ effect in GCs hosting radio halos, enabling constraints on the volume-averaged magnetic field strength within the ICM. We further assess how observations from upcoming ground-based CMB experiments improve these constraints.
  The imprints of parity-violating physics on the polarization of the CMB are predicted theoretically and recently, several methods have been used to measure the effect of cosmic birefringence from $Planck$ and $WMAP$ data. The miscalibration of polarization-sensitive detectors is found to be one of the limiting factors in this endeavour. We perform a relative and an absolute polarization angle calibration of the $Planck$ detectors using microwave and X-ray observations of the Crab nebula.
  Additionally, we develop a simulation pipeline to generate time-ordered data for an upcoming ground-based sub-mm telescope, analyzing the impact of correlated detector and atmospheric noise on CMB map reconstruction. Our findings in this thesis emphasize the importance of broad-frequency coverage for better foreground characterization and highlight the need for dedicated ground-based calibration to achieve accurate CMB polarization measurements.

      <title>Nonparametric reconstructions of dynamical dark energy via flexknots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmological surveys have provided unprecedented datasets that can be used to reconstruct the history of the dark energy equation of state. In this work, a free-form "flexknot'' parameterisation is employed to represent $w(a)$ as a linear spline between free-moving nodes, the number of which may vary. By combining DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements with Pantheon+ or DES5Y supernovae, the functional posteriors of $w(a)$ reveal an unexpected W-shaped structure. While the Bayesian evidence may still favour $\Lambda$CDM, the robustness of these results suggests the structure is indeed present in the data. The tension $R$-statistic and suspiciousness have been marginalised over models, and demonstrate that while the reconstructions from DESI and Pantheon+ agree, DESI and DES5Y do not. We conclude that, while there is no smoking gun for dynamical dark energy, the structure unearthed in this work is generally too complex to be captured by the restrictive $w$CDM or CPL parameterisations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIb. Eigenmodes and correlation matrices of spin-2 perturbations in orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenmodes of the spin-2 Laplacian in orientable Euclidean manifolds and their implications for the tensor-induced part of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies. We provide analytic expressions for the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes and of spherical harmonic coefficients. We demonstrate that non-trivial spatial topology alters the statistical properties of CMB tensor anisotropies, inducing correlations between harmonic coefficients of differing $\ell$ and $m$ and across every possible pair of temperature and $E$- and $B$-modes of polarization. This includes normally forbidden $TB$ and $EB$ correlations. We compute the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the pure tensor-induced CMB fluctuations in the usual infinite covering space and those in each of the non-trivial manifolds under consideration, varying both the size of the manifolds and the location of the observer. We find that the amount of information about the topology of the Universe contained in tensor-induced anisotropies does not saturate as fast as its scalar counterpart; indeed, the KL divergence continues to grow with the inclusion of higher multipoles up to the largest $\ell$ we have computed. Our results suggest that CMB polarization measurements from upcoming experiments can provide new avenues for detecting signatures of cosmic topology, motivating a full analysis where scalar and tensor perturbations are combined and noise is included.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16143v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions, using the on-shell and off-shell contributions to correlators to investigate the signatures of interactions. In particular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic expressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum interactivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is sufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In contrast to typical perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show that common non-linear contributions to inflationary perturbations can be well-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. In particular, we comment on the validity of using stochastic inflation to reproduce known in-in perturbative results. An extensive appendix provides a review of the Keldysh formulation of the in-in formalism with the initial state set at a finite, as opposed to infinite past, emphasizing the importance of considering temporal boundary terms and the initial state for correctly obtaining the propagators. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficiently accurate approximation to the full quantum evolution. This becomes particularly transparent in the Keldysh description.</description>

      <title>Inverting no-hair theorems: How requiring General Relativity solutions restricts scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions in general scalar-tensor theories are known to permit hair, i.e. non-trivial scalar profiles and/or metric solutions different from the ones of General Relativity (GR). Imposing that some such solutions$\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated in the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\unicode{x2013}$should exist, the space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate precisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic higher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is given by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant kinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under which the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR solutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of theories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear odd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly, we find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any deviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in particular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de Sitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the stability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation of a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via companion $\texttt {Mathematica}$ notebooks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses and mixing: Entering the era of subpercent precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an updated global analysis of the known and unknown parameters of the standard $3\nu$ framework as of 2025. The known oscillation parameters include three mixing angles $(\theta_{12},\,\theta_{23},\,\theta_{13})$ and two squared mass gaps, chosen as $\delta m^2=m^2_2-m^2_1&gt;0$ and $\Delta m^2=m^2_3-{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}(m^2_1+m^2_2)$, where $\alpha=\mathrm{sign}(\Delta m^2)$ distinguishes normal ordering (NO, $\alpha=+1$) from inverted ordering (IO, $\alpha=-1$). With respect to our previous 2021 update, the combination of oscillation data leads to appreciably reduced uncertainties for $\theta_{23}$, $\theta_{13}$ and $|\Delta m^2|$. In particular, $|\Delta m^2|$ is the first $3\nu$ parameter to enter the domain of subpercent precision (0.8\% at $1\sigma$). We underline some issues about systematics, that might affect this error estimate. Concerning oscillation unknowns, we find a relatively weak preference for NO versus IO (at $2.2\sigma$), for CP violation versus conservation in NO (1.3$\sigma$) and for the first $\theta_{23}$ octant versus the second in NO ($1.1\sigma$). We discuss the status and qualitative prospects of the mass ordering hint in the plane $(\delta m^2,\,\Delta m^2_{ee})$, where $\Delta m^2_{ee}=|\Delta m^2|+{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}\alpha(\cos^2\theta_{12}-\sin^2\theta_{12})\delta m^2$, to be measured by the JUNO experiment with subpercent precision. We also discuss upper bounds on nonoscillation observables. We report $m_\beta&lt;0.50$~eV and $m_{\beta\beta}&lt;0.086$~eV ($2\sigma$). Concerning the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma$, we discuss representative combinations of data, with or without augmenting the $\Lambda$CDM model with extra parameters accounting for possible systematics or new physics. The resulting $2\sigma$ upper limits are roughly spread around the bound $\Sigma &lt; 0.2$~eV within a factor of three. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Explaining the KM3-230213A Detection without Gamma-Ray Emission: Cosmic-Ray Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a high-energy neutrino event, designated KM3-230213A, was observed by the KM3NeT/ARCA detector in the Mediterranean Sea. This event is characterized by a reconstructed muon energy of approximately 120 PeV, corresponding to a median neutrino energy of roughly 220 PeV. To understand the origin, it is essential to investigate consistency with multi-messenger observations--particularly gamma-ray constraints--in various theoretical scenarios within and beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by this, we explore the possibility that the detected event does not originate from conventional neutrinos but rather from right-handed neutrinos (sterile neutrinos) mixing with active neutrinos, leading to the observed muon signal. Such cosmic-ray dark radiation may have originated either in the early Universe or through dark matter decay in the present epoch. We show that in both cases, while satisfying existing general constraints on light sterile neutrinos, the stringent multi-messenger gamma-ray limits can be significantly alleviated. A distinct prediction of this scenario is that such events can arrive from directions through Earth that would typically attenuate conventional neutrinos. A related scenario involving cosmic-ray boosted WIMP dark matter is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the black hole photon ring as a probe of ultralight dilaton fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) have facilitated unprecedented probing of superradiant phenomena in the vicinities of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), establishing an ideal laboratory to detect ultralight bosons beyond the Standard Model. In this study, we delve into how ultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole photon rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the form $f(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma refractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton cloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing simulations covering a range of plasma densities and dilaton coupling strengths, we reveal a periodic distortion in the photon ring morphology, with the periodicity aligning with that of the dilaton-driven plasma frequency oscillations. We then assess the magnitude of this effect under the current angular resolution constraints of VLBI observations. Our analysis indicates that a comprehensive search for superradiant dilaton clouds based on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling would necessitate radio interferometric baselines significantly exceeding the Earth's diameter to resolve the corresponding signatures.</description>

      <title>Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensions of equivalent representations of gravity are discussed in the metric-affine framework. First, we focus on: (i) General Relativity, based upon the metric tensor whose dynamics is given by the Ricci curvature scalar $R$; (ii) the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, based on tetrads and spin connection whose dynamics is given by the torsion scalar $T$; (iii) the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, formulated with respect to both the metric tensor and the affine connection and characterized by the non-metric scalar $Q$ with the role of gravitational field. They represent the so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity, because, even if based on different frameworks and different dynamical variables, such as curvature, torsion, and non-metricity, they express the same gravitational dynamics. Starting from this framework, we construct their extensions with the aim to study possible equivalence. We discuss the straightforward extension of General Relativity, the $f(R)$ gravity, where $f(R)$ is an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar. With this paradigm in mind, we take into account $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ extensions showing that they are not equivalent to $f(R)$. Dynamical equivalence is achieved if boundary terms are considered, that is $f(T-\tilde{B})$ and $f(Q-B)$ theories. The latter are the extensions of Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity and Symmetric Teleparallel of General Relativity, respectively. We obtain that $f(R)$, $f(T-\tilde{B})$, and $f(Q-B)$ form the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity. The aim is to show that also if dynamics are equivalent, foundations of theories of gravity can be very different.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Modified Entropic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking into account the temperature corrections of the energy equipartition law for the bits of information that are coarse-grained on the holographic screen leads to a modification of Einstein's gravitational field equations. In the very high-temperature limit, which corresponds to strong gravitational fields, the modified gravitational equations reduce to the standard Einstein equations of general relativity, but in the low-temperature limit, which corresponds to the weak gravity regime, the modified equations show significant deviations from the standard Einstein equations. We solve the modified Einstein equations for the FRW metric and obtain the modified Friedmann equations. We see that the Friedmann equations obtained with this approach agree with the Friedmann equations previously obtained from the thermodynamic corrections of classical Newtonian mechanics. Using the modified Friedmann equations for a flat universe, we investigate the implications of our modified entropic cosmology (MEC) model. We show that our model can explain the dynamics of the universe without requiring any kind of dark energy. Using the Pantheon supernovae dataset, BAO data, Planck 2018 CMB data, and SH0ES measurements for $H_0$, we test the MEC model against observations. We will see that MEC fits the observational data better than the standard cosmological model of $\Lambda$CDM. We also see that our model can successfully solve the $H_0$ tension that challenges the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Testing the dark origin of neutrino masses with oscillation experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown to date. One popular idea involves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described as fields or particles with masses $m_\phi \ll 10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the large phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent states and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a result, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in spacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation experiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\phi\gg 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, the mechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which suppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a function of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby ruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor experiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino masses is disfavored for $m_\phi \ll 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the case of constant mass values in vacuum. This result holds at more than the 4$\sigma$ level across different datasets and parameter choices. The mass range $10^{-17}\,\mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$ can be further tested in current and future oscillation experiments by searching for time variations (rather than periodicity) in oscillation parameters.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Fast Modeling of Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lenses in the Big Data Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing provides a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. However, conventional lens-modeling approaches are computationally expensive and require fine-tuning to avoid local optima, rendering them impractical for the hundreds of thousands of lenses expected from surveys such as Euclid, CSST, and Roman Space Telescopes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TinyLensGPU, a GPU-accelerated lens-modeling tool that employs XLA-based acceleration with JAX and a neural-network-enhanced nested sampling algorithm, nautilus-sampler. Tests on 1,000 simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses demonstrate that on an RTX 4060 Ti GPU, TinyLensGPU achieves likelihood evaluations approximately 2,000 times faster than traditional methods. Moreover, the nautilus-sampler reduces the number of likelihood evaluations by a factor of 3, decreasing the overall modeling time per lens from several days to roughly 3 minutes. Application to 63 SLACS lenses observed by the Hubble Space Telescope recovers Einstein radii consistent with the literature values (within $\lesssim 5\%$ deviation), which is within known systematic uncertainties. Catastrophic failures, where the sampler becomes trapped in local optima, occur in approximately 5\% of the simulated cases and 10\% of the SLACS sample. We argue that such issues are inherent to automated lens modeling but can be mitigated by incorporating prior knowledge from machine learning techniques. This work thus marks a promising step toward the efficient analysis of strong lenses in the era of big data. The code and data are available online: https://github.com/caoxiaoyue/TinyLensGpu.</description>

Abstract: The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the spectrum and polarization of the cosmic microwave background. Cosmological signals are small compared to the instantaneous instrument noise, requiring strict control of instrumental signals. The instrument design provides multiple levels of null operation, signal modulation, and signal differences, with only few-percent systematic error suppression required at each level. Jackknife tests based on discrete instrument symmetries provide an independent means to identify, model, and remove remaining instrumental signals. We use detailed time-ordered simulations, including realistic performance and tolerance parameters, to evaluate the instrument response to broad classes of systematic errors for both spectral distortions and polarization. The largest systematic errors contribute additional white noise at the few-percent level compared to the dominant photon noise. Coherent instrumental effects which do not integrate down are smaller still, and remain several orders of magnitude below the targeted cosmological signals.</description>

      <title>Reduced Hubble Tension in Dark Radiation Models after DESI 2024</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be less than $3\sigma$ and as low as $2\sigma$, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$. Upcoming data releases by DESI and other CMB and LSS surveys will decisively confirm or disfavour this conclusion.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE): Mission Design and Science Goals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission concept to measure the energy spectrum and linear polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy. We describe the PIXIE instrument sensitivity, foreground subtraction, and anticipated science return from both the baseline 2-year mission and a potential extended mission.</description>

      <title>Measuring $\sigma_8$ using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Emission-Line Galaxies and Planck CMB Lensing and the Impact of Dust on Parameter Inference</title>

Abstract: Measuring the growth of structure is a powerful probe for studying the dark sector, especially in light of the $\sigma_8$ tension between primary CMB anisotropy and low-redshift surveys. This paper provides a new measurement of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, $\sigma_8$, using galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-CMB lensing power spectra of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys Emission-Line Galaxies and the $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 CMB lensing map. We create an ELG catalog composed of $24$ million galaxies and with a purity of $85\%$, covering a redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 3$, with $z_{\rm mean} = 1.09$. We implement several novel systematic corrections, such as jointly modeling the contribution of imaging systematics and photometric redshift uncertainties to the covariance matrix. We also study the impacts of various dust maps on cosmological parameter inference. We measure the cross-power spectra over $f_{\rm sky} = 0.25$ with a signal-to-background ratio of up to $ 30\sigma$. We find that the choice of dust maps to account for imaging systematics in estimating the ELG overdensity field has a significant impact on the final estimated values of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm M}$, with far-infrared emission-based dust maps preferring $\sigma_8$ to be as low as $0.702 \pm 0.030$, and stellar-reddening-based dust maps preferring as high as $0.719 \pm 0.030$. The highest preferred value is at $\sim 3 \sigma$ tension with the $\textit{Planck}$ primary anisotropy results. These findings indicate a need for tomographic analyses at high redshifts and joint modeling of systematics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>

Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dark Sector (ETHOS $n=0$): Cosmological Constraints from SPT Cluster Abundance with DES and HST Weak Lensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use galaxy cluster abundance measurements from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) enhanced by Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) confirmation and complemented with mass information obtained using weak-lensing data from Dark Energy Survey Year~3 (DES Y3) and targeted Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations for probing deviations from the cold dark matter paradigm. Concretely, we consider a class of dark sector models featuring interactions between dark matter (DM) and a dark radiation (DR) component within the framework of the Effective Theory of Structure Formation (ETHOS). We focus on scenarios that lead to power suppression over a wide range of scales, and thus can be tested with data sensitive to large scales, as realized for example for DM$-$DR interactions following from an unbroken non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge theory (interaction rate with power-law index $n=0$ within the ETHOS parameterization). Cluster abundance measurements are mostly sensitive to the amount of DR interacting with DM, parameterized by the ratio of DR temperature to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, $\xi_{\rm DR}=T_{\rm DR}/T_{\rm CMB}$. We find an upper limit $\xi_{\rm DR}&lt;17\%$ at $95\%$ credibility. When the cluster data are combined with Planck 2018 CMB data along with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements we find $\xi_{\rm DR}&lt;10\%$, corresponding to a limit on the abundance of interacting DR that is around three times tighter than that from CMB+BAO data alone. We also discuss the complementarity of weak lensing informed cluster abundance studies with probes sensitive to smaller scales, explore the impact on our analysis of massive neutrinos, and comment on a slight preference for the presence of a non-zero interacting DR abundance, which enables a physical solution to the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-spread Function Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Void and Density Walls Inhomogeneous Cosmic Web Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An approach to cosmological modelling is presented that incorporates the inhomogeneous structure of the Cosmic Web, specifically focusing on the interplay between cosmic voids and density walls. We extend the standard homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model to account for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. By modifying the Friedmann equations to include inhomogeneity terms representing voids and walls, we develop a more realistic description of cosmic evolution. Our model demonstrates how the presence of these structures affects the overall expansion rate of the universe and the growth of perturbations. We find that accounting for this inhomogeneous distribution leads to significant deviations from the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the late-time universe. The Hubble and $\sigma_8$ structure growth tensions are addressed in the void-density wall model, leading to a resolution of these tensions. These results have important implications for the interpretation of cosmological observations when including the void and density wall Cosmic Web inhomogeneities.</description>

      <title>LensWatch. II. Improved Photometry and Time-delay Constraints on the Strongly Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx ("SN Zwicky") with HST Template Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective dynamics of loop quantum gravity for marginally bound Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetimes predict that the big-bang singularity is resolved and replaced by a cosmic bounce. Numerics show that these effective dynamics also homogenize small regions soon after the bounce when inhomogeneities before the bounce are sufficiently large. These homogeneous regions typically have a width of a few Planck lengths where relative perturbations in the energy density remain less than 15%. If the bounce is followed by an inflationary period, the homogeneous region can reach cosmic scales and the amplitude of relative perturbations can be suppressed to a value compatible with observations.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic MOND theory, promising in reproducing cosmology as well as the MOND phenomenology in the low acceleration regime, was recently proposed. We present the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation and relativistic perturbation equations of this theory in cosmological context. The PN equations are presented to 1PN order and perturbation equations are presented in fully-nonlinear and exact forms. The gauge issues are clarified. The 1PN equations and linear perturbation equations are presented without imposing temporal gauge conditions. We show that to 0PN order baryon perturbation grows faster in the MOND regime. The MOND field can be interpreted as a fluid with specific equation of state without anisotropic stress, and the Jeans criterion is derived for the MOND field.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degrees of freedom arise from the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole stellar microlensing constraints: understanding their dependence on the density and velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microlensing surveys of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud constrain the fraction of the Milky Way halo in Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with mass $10^{-9} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$. Various studies have reached different conclusions on the uncertainties in these constraints due to uncertainties in the Dark Matter (DM) distribution. We therefore revisit the dependence of the microlensing differential event rate, and hence exclusion limits, on the DM density and velocity distributions. The constraints on the abundance of low- and high-mass PBHs depend, respectively, on the long- and short-duration tails of the differential event rate distribution. Long-duration events are due to PBHs moving close to the line of sight and their rate (and hence the constraints on low-mass PBHs) has a fairly weak ($\sim 10\%$) dependence on the DM density and velocity distributions. Short-duration events are due to PBHs close to the observer and their rate (and hence the constraints on moderate- and high-mass PBHs) depends much more strongly on the DM velocity distribution. An accurate calculation of the local DM velocity distribution is therefore crucial for accurately calculating PBH stellar microlensing constraints.</description>

      <title>Supercooled phase transitions in conformal dark sectors explain NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent lore, it is difficult to explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays with supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in dark U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum. Our filtered cogenesis scenario can be probed via FOPT generated stochastic gravitational waves (GW) at near future detectors in addition to the well-known detection aspects of asteroid mass PBH constituting DM in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis with perturbations in type-II and type-III seesaw models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density perturbations have recently been shown to lead to a novel effect in the freeze-out of heavy particles called "acoustically driven freeze-out." This leads to an enhancement in the yield in standard leptogenesis. We extend this calculation to include $2 \to 2$ washout processes in type-I leptogenesis and the Sommerfeld-enhanced $2 \to 2$ gauge annihilations in type-II and type-III leptogenesis. These CP conserving gauge annihilations suppress the yield of heavy particles sourcing the asymmetry. We show the acoustically driven freeze-out leads to novel enhancements in the baryon asymmetry in type-II and type-III leptogenesis, already in the weak washout regime, in contrast with type-I leptogenesis.</description>
