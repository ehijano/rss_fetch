      <title>Local form subordination without a power decay and a criterion of Riesz basesness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the local form subordination condition on the perturbation of a self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent, which is used to show the Riesz basis property of the eigensystem of the perturbed operator. Our new assumptions and new proof allow for establishing the Riesz basis property also in the case of slow and non-monotone decay in this subordination condition.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue estimates for the poly-Laplace operator on lattice subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the discrete poly-Laplace operator on a subgraph with Dirichlet boundary condition. We obtain upper and lower bounds for the sum of the first $k$ Dirichlet eigenvalues of the poly-Laplace operators on a finite subgraph of lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ extending classical results of Li-Yau and Kr\"oger. Moreover, we prove that the Dirichlet $2l$-order poly-Laplace eigenvalues are at least as large as the squares of the Dirichlet $l$-order poly-Laplace eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Nodal counts for the Robin problem on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Courant-sharp eigenvalues of the Robin Laplacian for bounded, connected, open sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$, with Lipschitz boundary. We prove Pleijel's theorem which implies that there are only finitely many Courant-sharp eigenvalues in this setting as well as an improved version of Pleijel's theorem, extending previously known results that required more regularity of the boundary. In addition, we obtain an upper bound for the number of Courant-sharp Robin eigenvalues of a bounded, connected, convex, open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $C^2$ boundary that is explicit in terms of the geometric quantities of the set and the norm sup of the negative part of the Robin parameter.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the Neumann magnetic Laplacian in the unit disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions in the unit disk $\mathbb D$ in $\mathbb R^2$. There is a rather complete asymptotic analysis when the constant magnetic field tends to $+\infty$ and some inequalities seem to hold for any value of this magnetic field leading to rather simple conjectures. Our goal is to explore these questions by revisiting a classical picture of the physicist D. Saint-James theoretically and numerically. On the way, we revisit the asymptotic analysis in light of the asymptotics obtained by Fournais-Helffer that we can improve by combining with a formula stated by Saint-James.</description>

      <title>Equivalent spectral theory for fundamental graph cut problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop equivalent spectral graph theory for several fundamental graph cut problems including maxcut, mincut, Cheeger cut, anti-Cheeger cut, dual Cheeger problem and their useful variants. The finer structure of the eigenvectors, the Courant nodal domain theorem and the graphic feature of eigenvalues are studied systematically in the setting of these new nonlinear eigenproblems. A specified strategy for achieving an equivalent eigenproblem is proposed for a general graph cut problem via the Dinkelbach scheme. We also establish several multi-way inequalities relating the variational eigenvalues and min-max $k$-cut problems, which closely resembles the higher-order Cheeger inequality on graph 1-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Suprema of L\'evy processes with completely monotone jumps: spectral-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spectral-theoretic properties of non-self-adjoint operators arising in the study of one-dimensional L\'evy processes with completely monotone jumps with a one-sided barrier. With no further assumptions, we provide an integral expression for the bivariate Laplace transform of the transition density $p_t^+(x, y)$ of the killed process in $(0, \infty)$, and under a minor regularity condition, a generalised eigenfunction expansion is given for the corresponding transition operator $P_t^+$. Assuming additionally appropriate growth of the characteristic exponent, we prove a generalised eigenfunction expansion of the transition density $p_t^+(x, y)$. Under similar conditions, we additionally show integral formulae for the cumulative distribution functions of the infimum and supremum functionals $\underline{X}_t$ and $\overline{X}_t$. The class of processes covered by our results include many stable and stable-like L\'evy processes, as well as many processes with Brownian components. Our results recover known expressions for the classical risk process, and provide similar integral formulae for some other simple examples of L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Stability of quaternion matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A right quaternion matrix polynomial is an expression of the form $P(\lambda)= \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{m}A_i \lambda^i$, where $A_i$'s are $n \times n$ quaternion matrices with $A_m \neq 0$. The aim of this manuscript is to determine the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ relative to certain subsets of the set of quaternions. In particular, we extend the notion of (hyper)stability of complex matrix polynomials to quaternion matrix polynomials and obtain location of right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ using the following methods: $(1)$ we give a relation between (hyper)stability of a quaternion matrix polynomial and its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, $(2)$ we prove that $P(\lambda)$ is stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in the set of quaternions, centered at a complex number if and only if it is stable with respect to its intersection with the set of complex numbers and $(3)$ as a consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$, we prove that right eigenvalues of $P(\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the set of quaternions centered at the origin. A generalization of the Enestr{\"o}m-Kakeya theorem to quaternion matrix polynomials is obtained as an application. We identify classes of quaternion matrix polynomials for which stability and hyperstability are equivalent. We finally deduce hyperstability of certain univariate quaternion matrix polynomials via stability of certain multivariate quaternion matrix polynomials.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$.</description>

      <title>Exponentially many graphs are determined by their spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a discrete analogue of Kac's celebrated question on "hearing the shape of a drum", and towards a practical graph isomorphism test, it is of interest to understand which graphs are determined up to isomorphism by their spectrum (of their adjacency matrix). A striking conjecture in this area, due to van Dam and Haemers, is that "almost all graphs are determined by their spectrum", meaning that the fraction of unlabelled $n$-vertex graphs which are determined by their spectrum converges to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.
  In this paper we make a step towards this conjecture, showing that there are exponentially many $n$-vertex graphs which are determined by their spectrum. This improves on previous bounds (of shape $e^{c\sqrt{n}}$). We also propose a number of further directions of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine methods from microlocal analysis and dimension theory to study resonances with largest real part for an Anosov flow with smooth real valued potential. We show that the resonant states are closely related to special systems of measures supported on the stable manifolds introduced by Climenhaga. As a result, we relate the presence of the resonances on the critical axis to mixing properties of the flow with respect to certain equilibrium measures and show that these equilibrium measures can be reconstructed from the spectral theory of the Anosov flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and volume growth. In particular, we obtain a volume estimate of amply regular graphs which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>
