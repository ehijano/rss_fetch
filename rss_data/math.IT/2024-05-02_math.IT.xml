      <title>Successive Interference Cancellation for ISAC in a Large Full-Duplex Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reuse the scarce spectrum efficiently, a large full-duplex cellular network with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is studied. Monostatic detection at the base station (BS) is considered. At the BS, we receive two signals: the communication-mode uplink signal to be decoded and the radar-mode signal to be detected. After self-interference cancellation (SIC), inspired by NOMA, successive interference cancellation (SuIC) is a natural strategy at the BS to retrieve both signals. However, the ordering of SuIC, usually based on some measure of channel strength, is not clear as the radar-mode target is unknown. The detection signal suffers a double path-loss making it vulnerable, but the uplink signal to be decoded originates at a user which has much lower power than the BS making it weak as well. Further, the intercell interference from a large network reduces the channel disparity between the two signals. We investigate the impact of both SuIC orders at the BS, i.e., decoding $1^{st}$ or detecting $1^{st}$ and highlight the importance of careful order selection. We find the existence of a threshold target distance before which detecting $1^{st}$ is superior and decoding $2^{nd}$ does not suffer much. After this distance, both decoding $1^{st}$ and detecting $2^{nd}$ is superior. Similarly, a threshold UE power exists after which the optimum SuIC order changes. We consider imperfections in SIC; this helps highlight the vulnerability of the decoding and detection in the setup.</description>

      <title>Improving Channel Resilience for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Unified Information Bottleneck Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communications (TSC) enhance radio resource efficiency by transmitting task-relevant semantic information. However, current research often overlooks the inherent semantic distinctions among encoded features. Due to unavoidable channel variations from time and frequency-selective fading, semantically sensitive feature units could be more susceptible to erroneous inference if corrupted by dynamic channels. Therefore, this letter introduces a unified channel-resilient TSC framework via information bottleneck. This framework complements existing TSC approaches by controlling information flow to capture fine-grained feature-level semantic robustness. Experiments on a case study for real-time subchannel allocation validate the framework's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Nearly Perfect Covering Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly perfect packing codes are those codes that meet the Johnson upper bound on the size of error-correcting codes. This bound is an improvement to the sphere-packing bound. A related bound for covering codes is known as the van Wee bound. Codes that meet this bound will be called nearly perfect covering codes. In this paper, such codes with covering radius one will be considered. It will be proved that these codes can be partitioned into three families depending on the smallest distance between neighboring codewords. Some of the codes contained in these families will be completely characterized. Construction for codes for each such family will be presented, the weight distribution of codes from these families will be examined, and some codes with special properties will be discussed.</description>

      <title>New upper bounds on the number of non-zero weights of constacyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any simple-root constacyclic code $\mathcal{C}$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, as far as we know, the group $\mathcal{G}$ generated by the multiplier, the constacyclic shift and the scalar multiplications is the largest subgroup of the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, by calculating the number of $\mathcal{G}$-orbits of $\mathcal{C}\backslash\{\bf 0\}$, we give an explicit upper bound on the number of non-zero weights of $\mathcal{C}$ and present a necessary and sufficient condition for $\mathcal{C}$ to meet the upper bound. Some examples in this paper show that our upper bound is tight and better than the upper bounds in [Zhang and Cao, FFA, 2024]. In particular, our main results provide a new method to construct few-weight constacyclic codes. Furthermore, for the constacyclic code $\mathcal{C}$ belonging to two special types, we obtain a smaller upper bound on the number of non-zero weights of $\mathcal{C}$ by substituting $\mathcal{G}$ with a larger subgroup of ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal{C})$. The results derived in this paper generalize the main results in [Chen, Fu and Liu, IEEE-TIT, 2024]}.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Beam Tracking with Liquid Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology of the sixth-generation communication networks due to the large amounts of available spectrum at high frequencies. However, the huge overhead associated with beam training imposes a significant challenge in mmWave communications, particularly in urban environments with high background noise. To reduce this high overhead, we propose a novel solution for robust continuous-time beam tracking with liquid neural network, which dynamically adjust the narrow mmWave beams to ensure real-time beam alignment with mobile users. Through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches. Specifically, our scheme achieves at most 46.9% higher normalized spectral efficiency than the baselines when the user is moving at 5 m/s, demonstrating the potential of liquid neural networks to enhance mmWave mobile communication performance.</description>

      <title>Directed Redundancy in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the average amount of redundant information that is transferred from a subset of relevant random source processes to a target process. To identify the relevant source processes, we consider those that are connected to the target process and in addition share a certain proportion of the total information causally provided to the target. Even if the relevant processes have no directed information exchange between them, they can still causally provide redundant information to the target. This makes it difficult to identify the relevant processes. To solve this issue, we propose the existence of a hidden redundancy process that governs the shared information among the relevant processes. We bound the redundancy by the minimal average directed redundancy from the relevant processes to the target, from the hidden redundancy process to the target, and from the hidden redundancy process to the relevant processes.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Inferring by Conditional WGAN-GP for Holographic Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The beamforming technology with large holographic antenna arrays is one of the key enablers for the next generation of wireless systems, which can significantly improve the spectral efficiency. However, the deployment of large antenna arrays implies high algorithm complexity and resource overhead at both receiver and transmitter ends. To address this issue, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence have been developed to reduce beamforming overhead. Intuitively, if we can implement the near-optimal beamforming only using a tiny subset of the all channel information, the overhead for channel estimation and beamforming would be reduced significantly compared with the traditional beamforming methods that usually need full channel information and the inversion of large dimensional matrix. In light of this idea, we propose a novel scheme that utilizes Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty to infer the full beamforming matrices based on very little of channel information. Simulation results confirm that it can accomplish comparable performance with the weighted minimum mean-square error algorithm, while reducing the overhead by over 50%.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-leakage by R\'{e}nyi Divergence and Sibson Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper proposes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain measure. R\'{e}nyi divergence is shown to be the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain incurred at each elementary event $y$ of channel output $Y$ and Sibson mutual information is the $\tilde{f}$-mean of this $Y$-elementary information gain. Both are proposed as $\alpha$-leakage measures, indicating the most information an adversary can obtain on sensitive data. It is shown that the existing $\alpha$-leakage by Arimoto mutual information can be expressed as $\tilde{f}$-mean measures by a scaled probability. Further, Sibson mutual information is interpreted as the maximum $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain over all estimation decisions applied to channel output. This reveals that the exiting generalized Blahut-Arimoto method for computing R\'{e}nyi capacity (or Gallager's error exponent) in fact maximizes a $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain iteratively over estimation decision and channel input. This paper also derives a decomposition of $\tilde{f}$-mean information gain, analogous to the Sibson identity for R\'{e}nyi divergence.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of Discrete Schemes for Computing the Rate-Distortion Function of Continuous Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the rate-distortion function for continuous sources is commonly regarded as a standard continuous optimization problem. When numerically addressing this problem, a typical approach involves discretizing the source space and subsequently solving the associated discrete problem. However, existing literature has predominantly concentrated on the convergence analysis of solving discrete problems, usually neglecting the convergence relationship between the original continuous optimization and its associated discrete counterpart. This neglect is not rigorous, since the solution of a discrete problem does not necessarily imply convergence to the solution of the original continuous problem, especially for non-linear problems. To address this gap, our study employs rigorous mathematical analysis, which constructs a series of finite-dimensional spaces approximating the infinite-dimensional space of the probability measure, establishing that solutions from discrete schemes converge to those from the continuous problems.</description>

      <title>A Double Maximization Approach for Optimizing the LM Rate of Mismatched Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approach is established for maximizing the Lower bound on the Mismatch capacity (hereafter abbreviated as LM rate), a key performance bound in mismatched decoding, by optimizing the channel input probability distribution. Under a fixed channel input probability distribution, the computation of the corresponding LM rate is a convex optimization problem. When optimizing the channel input probability distribution, however, the corresponding optimization problem adopts a max-min formulation, which is generally non-convex and is intractable with standard approaches. To solve this problem, a novel dual form of the LM rate is proposed, thereby transforming the max-min formulation into an equivalent double maximization formulation. This new formulation leads to a maximization problem setup wherein each individual optimization direction is convex. Consequently, an alternating maximization algorithm is established to solve the resultant maximization problem setup. Each step of the algorithm only involves a closed-form iteration, which is efficiently implemented with standard optimization procedures. Numerical experiments show the proposed approach for optimizing the LM rate leads to noticeable rate gains.</description>

      <title>Construction of extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes via doubling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes are a class of self-dual $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes with Euclidean weights divisible by $16$ and the largest possible minimum Euclidean weight for a given length. We introduce a doubling method for constructing a Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$-code of length $n$ from a known Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$-code of length $n$. Based on this method, we develop an algorithm to construct new extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes starting from an extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-code of type $(\frac{n}{2},0,0)$ with an extremal $\mathbb{Z}_4$-residue code and length $24, 32$ or $40$.
  We construct at least ten new extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes of length $32$ and type $(15,1,1)$. Extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes of length $32$ of this type were not known before. Moreover, the binary residue codes of the constructed extremal $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes are optimal $[32,15]$ binary codes.</description>

      <title>An Expectation-Maximization Relaxed Method for Privacy Funnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The privacy funnel (PF) gives a framework of privacy-preserving data release, where the goal is to release useful data while also limiting the exposure of associated sensitive information. This framework has garnered significant interest due to its broad applications in characterization of the privacy-utility tradeoff. Hence, there is a strong motivation to develop numerical methods with high precision and theoretical convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a novel relaxation variant based on Jensen's inequality of the objective function for the computation of the PF problem. This model is proved to be equivalent to the original in terms of optimal solutions and optimal values. Based on our proposed model, we develop an accurate algorithm which only involves closed-form iterations. The convergence of our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed through descent estimation and Pinsker's inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Profitability in Timely Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a communication system where a group of users, interconnected in a bidirectional gossip network, wishes to follow a time-varying source, e.g., updates on an event, in real-time. The users wish to maintain their expected version ages below a threshold, and can either rely on gossip from their neighbors or directly subscribe to a server publishing about the event, if the former option does not meet the timeliness requirements. The server wishes to maximize its profit by increasing subscriptions from users and minimizing event sampling frequency to reduce costs. This leads to a Stackelberg game between the server and the users where the sender is the leader deciding its sampling frequency and the users are the followers deciding their subscription strategies. We investigate equilibrium strategies for low-connectivity and high-connectivity topologies.</description>

      <title>A theory of best choice selection through objective arguments grounded in Linear Response Theory concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose how to use objective arguments grounded in statistical mechanics concepts in order to obtain a single number, obtained after aggregation, which would allow to rank "agents", "opinions", ..., all defined in a very broad sense. We aim toward any process which should a priori demand or lead to some consensus in order to attain the presumably best choice among many possibilities. In order to precise the framework, we discuss previous attempts, recalling trivial "means of scores", - weighted or not, Condorcet paradox, TOPSIS, etc. We demonstrate through geometrical arguments on a toy example, with 4 criteria, that the pre-selected order of criteria in previous attempts makes a difference on the final result. However, it might be unjustified. Thus, we base our "best choice theory" on the linear response theory in statistical mechanics: we indicate that one should be calculating correlations functions between all possible choice evaluations, thereby avoiding an arbitrarily ordered set of criteria. We justify the point through an example with 6 possible criteria. Applications in many fields are suggested. Beside, two toy models serving as practical examples and illustrative arguments are given in an Appendix.</description>

      <title>Quantum Doeblin coefficients: A simple upper bound on contraction coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contraction coefficients give a quantitative strengthening of the data processing inequality. As such, they have many natural applications whenever closer analysis of information processing is required. However, it is often challenging to calculate these coefficients. As a remedy we discuss a quantum generalization of Doeblin coefficients. These give an efficiently computable upper bound on many contraction coefficients. We prove several properties and discuss generalizations and applications. In particular, we give additional stronger bounds for PPT channels and introduce reverse Doeblin coefficients that bound certain expansion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Methods for a Tree-Structured Stick-Breaking Process Mixture of Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bayes coding algorithm for context tree source is a successful example of Bayesian tree estimation in text compression in information theory. This algorithm provides an efficient parametric representation of the posterior tree distribution and exact updating of its parameters. We apply this algorithm to a clustering task in machine learning. More specifically, we apply it to Bayesian estimation of the tree-structured stick-breaking process (TS-SBP) mixture models. For TS-SBP mixture models, only Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been proposed so far, but any variational Bayesian methods have not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose a variational Bayesian method that has a subroutine similar to the Bayes coding algorithm for context tree sources. We confirm its behavior by a numerical experiment on a toy example.</description>

      <title>Robust Semi-supervised Learning via $f$-Divergence and $\alpha$-R\'enyi Divergence</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates a range of empirical risk functions and regularization methods suitable for self-training methods in semi-supervised learning. These approaches draw inspiration from various divergence measures, such as $f$-divergences and $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergences. Inspired by the theoretical foundations rooted in divergences, i.e., $f$-divergences and $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence, we also provide valuable insights to enhance the understanding of our empirical risk functions and regularization techniques. In the pseudo-labeling and entropy minimization techniques as self-training methods for effective semi-supervised learning, the self-training process has some inherent mismatch between the true label and pseudo-label (noisy pseudo-labels) and some of our empirical risk functions are robust, concerning noisy pseudo-labels. Under some conditions, our empirical risk functions demonstrate better performance when compared to traditional self-training methods.</description>

      <title>FMLFS: A federated multi-label feature selection based on information theory in IoT environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain emerging applications such as health monitoring wearable and traffic monitoring systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices generate or collect a huge amount of multi-label datasets. Within these datasets, each instance is linked to a set of labels. The presence of noisy, redundant, or irrelevant features in these datasets, along with the curse of dimensionality, poses challenges for multi-label classifiers. Feature selection (FS) proves to be an effective strategy in enhancing classifier performance and addressing these challenges. Yet, there is currently no existing distributed multi-label FS method documented in the literature that is suitable for distributed multi-label datasets within IoT environments. This paper introduces FMLFS, the first federated multi-label feature selection method. Here, mutual information between features and labels serves as the relevancy metric, while the correlation distance between features, derived from mutual information and joint entropy, is utilized as the redundancy measure. Following aggregation of these metrics on the edge server and employing Pareto-based bi-objective and crowding distance strategies, the sorted features are subsequently sent back to the IoT devices. The proposed method is evaluated through two scenarios: 1) transmitting reduced-size datasets to the edge server for centralized classifier usage, and 2) employing federated learning with reduced-size datasets. Evaluation across three metrics - performance, time complexity, and communication cost - demonstrates that FMLFS outperforms five other comparable methods in the literature and provides a good trade-off on three real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Modular Pragmatic Architecture for Multiuser MIMO with Array-Fed RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a power- and hardware-efficient, pragmatic, modular, multiuser/multibeam array-fed RIS architecture particularly suited to operate in very high frequency bands (high mmWave and sub-THz), where channels are typically sparse in the beamspace and line-of-sight (LOS) is required to achieve an acceptable received signal level. The key module is an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) with a small number of active antennas placed in the near field of a RIS with a much larger number of passive controllable reflecting elements. We propose a pragmatic approach to obtain a steerable beam with high gain and very low sidelobes. Then, $K$ independently controlled beams can be achieved by stacking $K$ of such AMAF-RIS modules. Our analysis takes in full account: 1) the near-end crosstalk (NEXT) between the modules, 2) the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) due to the sidelobes; 3) a thorough energy efficiency comparison with respect to conventional {\em active arrays} with the same beamforming performance. Overall, we show that the proposed architecture is very attractive in terms of spectral efficiency, ease of implementation (hardware complexity), and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Alpha-NML Universal Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the connection between classical regret measures employed in universal prediction and R\'{e}nyi divergence, we introduce a new class of universal predictors that depend on a real parameter $\alpha\geq 1$. This class interpolates two well-known predictors, the mixture estimators, that include the Laplace and the Krichevsky-Trofimov predictors, and the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) estimator. We point out some advantages of this new class of predictors and study its benefits from two complementary viewpoints: (1) we prove its optimality when the maximal R\'{e}nyi divergence is considered as a regret measure, which can be interpreted operationally as a middle ground between the standard average and worst-case regret measures; (2) we discuss how it can be employed when NML is not a viable option, as an alternative to other predictors such as Luckiness NML. Finally, we apply the $\alpha$-NML predictor to the class of discrete memoryless sources (DMS), where we derive simple formulas to compute the predictor and analyze its asymptotic performance in terms of worst-case regret.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) is a self-supervised learning (SSL) method that has shown promising results on a variety of tasks. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying VICReg remain unexplored. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic perspective on the VICReg objective. We begin by deriving information-theoretic quantities for deterministic networks as an alternative to unrealistic stochastic network assumptions. We then relate the optimization of the VICReg objective to mutual information optimization, highlighting underlying assumptions and facilitating a constructive comparison with other SSL algorithms and derive a generalization bound for VICReg, revealing its inherent advantages for downstream tasks. Building on these results, we introduce a family of SSL methods derived from information-theoretic principles that outperform existing SSL techniques.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimum Received Power with Elementwise Updates in the Least Number of Steps for Discrete-Phase RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of optimizing discrete phases in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to maximize the received power at a user equipment is addressed. Necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve this maximization are given. These conditions are employed in an algorithm to achieve the maximization. New versions of the algorithm are given that are proven to achieve convergence in N or fewer steps whether the direct link is completely blocked or not, where N is the number of the RIS elements, whereas previously published results achieve this in KN or 2N number of steps where K is the number of discrete phases. Thus, for a discrete-phase RIS, the techniques presented in this paper achieve the optimum received power in the smallest number of steps published in the literature. In addition, in each of those N steps, the techniques presented in this paper determine only one or a small number of phase shifts with a simple elementwise update rule, which result in a substantial reduction of computation time, as compared to the algorithms in the literature. As a secondary result, we define the uniform polar quantization (UPQ) algorithm which is an intuitive quantization algorithm that can approximate the continuous solution with an approximation ratio of sinc^2(1/K) and achieve low time-complexity, given perfect knowledge of the channel.</description>

      <title>New Construction of $q$-ary Codes Correcting a Burst of at most $t$ Deletions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for any fixed positive integers $t$ and $q&gt;2$, we construct $q$-ary codes correcting a burst of at most $t$ deletions with redundancy $\log n+8\log\log n+o(\log\log n)+\gamma_{q,t}$ bits and near-linear encoding/decoding complexity, where $n$ is the message length and $\gamma_{q,t}$ is a constant that only depends on $q$ and $t$. In previous works there are constructions of such codes with redundancy $\log n+O(\log q\log\log n)$ bits or $\log n+O(t^2\log\log n)+O(t\log q)$. The redundancy of our new construction is independent of $q$ and $t$ in the second term.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communications for Unsourced Random Access: Fundamental Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with a massive number of unsourced and uncoordinated users. In the proposed model, known as the unsourced ISAC system (UNISAC), all active communication and sensing users share a short frame to transmit their signals, without requiring scheduling with the base station (BS). Hence, the signal received from each user is affected by significant interference from numerous interfering users, making it challenging to extract the transmitted signals. UNISAC aims to decode the transmitted message sequences from communication users while simultaneously detect active sensing users, regardless of the identity of the decoded and detected users. In this paper, we derive an achievable performance limit for UNISAC and demonstrate its superiority over conventional approaches such as ALOHA, time-division multiple access, treating interference as noise, and multiple signal classification. Through numerical simulations, we validate the UNISAC's effectiveness in detecting and decoding a large number of users.</description>

Abstract: This article proposes a new two-parameter generalized entropy, which can be reduced to the Tsallis and the Shannon entropy for specific values of its parameters. We develop a number of information-theoretic properties of this generalized entropy and divergence, for instance, the sub-additive property, strong sub-additive property, joint convexity, and information monotonicity. This article presents an exposit investigation on the information-theoretic and information-geometric characteristics of the new generalized entropy and compare them with the properties of the Tsallis and the Shannon entropy.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Difference-of-Convex Solver for Privacy Funnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver, and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods. Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference phase contrary to the baselines.</description>

Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-user quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with rate-limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>
