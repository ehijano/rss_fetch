      <title>Distributed Nonconvex Optimization with Exponential Convergence Rate via Hybrid Systems Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid systems framework for distributed multi-agent optimization in which agents execute computations in continuous time and communicate in discrete time. The optimization algorithm is analogous to a continuous-time form of parallelized coordinate descent. Agents implement an update-and-hold strategy in which gradients are computed at communication times and held constant during flows between communications. The completeness of solutions under these hybrid dynamics is established. Then, we prove that this system is globally exponentially stable to a minimizer of a possibly nonconvex, smooth objective function that satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. Simulation results are presented for four different applications and illustrate the convergence rates and the impact of initial conditions upon convergence.</description>

      <title>Backcasting the Optimal Decisions in Transport Systems: An Example with Electric Vehicle Purchase Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study represents a first attempt to build a backcasting methodology to identify the optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. In this methodology, desired objectives are set by decision makers at a given time horizon, and then the optimal combinations of policies to achieve these objectives are computed as a function of time (i.e., ``backcasted''). This approach is illustrated on the transportation sector by considering a specific subsystem with a single policy decision. The subsystem describes the evolution of the passenger car fleet within a given region and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The optimized policy is a monetary incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles while minimizing the total budget of the state and achieving a desired CO$_2$ target. A case study applied to Metropolitan France is presented to illustrate the approach. Additionally, alternative policy scenarios are also analyzed to provide further insights.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Convergence of Muon and Further</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we inspect the convergence of a new optimizer for pretraining LLMs, namely the Muon optimizer. Such an optimizer is closely related to a specialized steepest descent method where the update direction is the minimizer of the quadratic approximation of the objective function under spectral norm. We provide the convergence analysis on both versions of the optimizer and discuss its implications.</description>

      <title>Dominance Regions of Pursuit-evasion Games in Non-anticipative Information Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evader's dominance region is an important concept and the foundation of geometric methods for pursuit-evasion games. This article mainly reveals the relevant properties of the evader's dominance region, especially in non-anticipative information patterns. We can use these properties to research pursuit-evasion games in non-anticipative information patterns. The core problem is under what condition the pursuer has a non-anticipative strategy to prevent the evader leaving its initial dominance region before being captured regardless of the evader's strategy. We first define the evader's dominance region by the shortest path distance, and we rigorously prove for the first time that the initial dominance region of the evader is the reachable region of the evader in the open-loop sense. Subsequently, we prove that there exists a non-anticipative strategy by which the pursuer can capture the evader before the evader leaves its initial dominance region's closure in the absence of obstacles. For cases with obstacles, we provide a counter example to illustrate that such a non-anticipative strategy does not always exist, and provide a necessary condition for the existence of such strategy. Finally, we consider a scenario with a single corner obstacle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of such a non-anticipative strategy. At the end of this article, we discuss the application of the evader's dominance region in target defense games. This article has important reference significance for the design of non-anticipative strategies in pursuit-evasion games with obstacles.</description>

      <title>An analysis of optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving mixed-integer optimization problems with embedded neural networks with ReLU activation functions is challenging. Big-M coefficients that arise in relaxing binary decisions related to these functions grow exponentially with the number of layers. We survey and propose different approaches to analyze and improve the run time behavior of mixed-integer programming solvers in this context. Among them are clipped variants and regularization techniques applied during training as well as optimization-based bound tightening and a novel scaling for given ReLU networks. We numerically compare these approaches for three benchmark problems from the literature. We use the number of linear regions, the percentage of stable neurons, and overall computational effort as indicators. As a major takeaway we observe and quantify a trade-off between the often desired redundancy of neural network models versus the computational costs for solving related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of the fidelity coefficient in a Cahn-Hilliard image inpainting model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inpainting model proposed by A. Bertozzi et al., which is based on a Cahn--Hilliard-type equation. This equation describes the evolution of an order parameter $u \in [0,1]$ representing an approximation of the original image which occupies a bounded two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. The given image $g$ is assumed to be damaged in a fixed subdomain $D \subset \Omega$ and the equation is characterized by a linear reaction term of the form $\lambda (u - g)$. Here $\lambda = \lambda_0 \chi_{\Omega \setminus D}$ is the so-called fidelity coefficient, $\lambda_0$ being a strictly positive bounded function. The idea is that, given an initial image $u_0$, $u$ evolves towards $g$ and this process properly diffuses through the boundary of $D$ restoring the damaged image, provided that $\lambda_0$ is large enough. Here, we formulate an optimal control problem based on this fact, namely our cost functional accounts for the magnitude of $\lambda_0$. Assuming a singular potential to assure that $u$ takes its values in $[0,1]$, we first analyse the control-to-state operator and prove the existence of at least one optimal control, establishing the validity of first-order optimality conditions. Then, under suitable assumptions, we demonstrate second-order optimality conditions. All these results depend on the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution, which we obtain thanks to the strict separation property from pure phases.</description>

      <title>The bilinear Hessian for large scale optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second order information is useful in many ways in smooth optimization problems, including for the design of step size rules and descent directions, or the analysis of the local properties of the objective functional. However, the computation and storage of the Hessian matrix using second order partial derivatives is prohibitive in many contexts, and in particular in large scale problems. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing and presenting second order information in analytic form. The key novel insight is that the Hessian for a problem can be worked with efficiently by computing its bilinear form or operator form using Taylor expansions, instead of introducing a basis and then computing the Hessian matrix. Our new framework is suited for high-dimensional problems stemming e.g. from imaging applications, where computation of the Hessian matrix is unfeasible. We also show how this can be used to implement Newton's step rule, Daniel's Conjugate Gradient rule, or Quasi-Newton schemes, without explicit knowledge of the Hessian matrix, and illustrate our findings with a simple numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>The Isotropic Material Design methods with the cost expressed by the $L^p$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns the problem of minimization of the compliance of linear elastic structures made of an isotropic material. The bulk and shear moduli are the design variables, both viewed as non-negative fields on the design domain. The design variables are subject to the isoperimetric condition which is the upper bound on the two kinds of $L^p$-norms of the elastic moduli. The case of $p=1$ corresponds to the original concept of the Isotropic Material Design (IMD) method proposed in the paper: S. Czarnecki, Isotropic material design, Computational Methods in Science and Technology, 21 (2), 49-64, 2015. In the present paper the IMD method will be extended by assuming the $L^p$-norms-based cost conditions. In each case the optimum design problem is reduced to the pair of mutually dual problems of the mathematical structure of a theory of elasticity of an isotropic body with non-linear power-law type constitutive equations. The state of stress determines the optimal layouts of the bulk and shear moduli of the least compliant structure. The new methods proposed deliver the upper estimates for the optimal compliance predicted by the original IMD method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Mediated Graphs: The role of Combinatorics in Conic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a unified definition of mediated graph, a combinatorial structure with multiple applications in mathematical optimization. We study some geometric and algebraic properties of this family of graphs and analyze extremal mediated graphs under the partial order induced by the cardinalty of their vertex sets. We derive mixed integer linear formulations to compute these challenging graphs and show that these structures are crucial in different fields, such as sum of squares decomposition of polynomials and second-order cone representations of convex cones, with a direct impact on conic optimization. We report the results of an extensive battery of experiments to show the validity of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stochastic Proximal Point Methods: Generalized Smoothness and Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of nonsmooth optimization problems in machine learning has spurred significant interest in generalized smoothness assumptions. Among these, the (L0,L1)-smoothness assumption has emerged as one of the most prominent. While proximal methods are well-suited and effective for nonsmooth problems in deterministic settings, their stochastic counterparts remain underexplored. This work focuses on the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM), valued for its stability and minimal hyperparameter tuning - advantages often missing in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We propose a novel phi-smoothness framework and provide a comprehensive analysis of SPPM without relying on traditional smoothness assumptions. Our results are highly general, encompassing existing findings as special cases. Furthermore, we examine SPPM under the widely adopted expected similarity assumption, thereby extending its applicability to a broader range of scenarios. Our theoretical contributions are illustrated and validated by practical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Optimal Shape Design Method for Lattice Structure Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice structures, known for their superior mechanical properties, are widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedical. Their advantages primarily lie in the interconnected struts at the micro-scale. The robust construction of these struts is crucial for downstream design and manufacturing applications, as it provides a detailed shape description necessary for precise simulation and fabrication. However, constructing lattice structures presents significant challenges, particularly at nodes where multiple struts intersect. The complexity of these intersections can lead to robustness issues. To address this challenge, this paper presents an optimization-based approach that simplifies the construction of lattice structures by cutting struts and connecting them to optimized node shapes. By utilizing the recent Grey Wolf optimization method -- a type of meta-heuristic method -- for node shape design, the approach ensures robust model construction and optimal shape design. Its effectiveness has been validated through a series of case studies with increasing topological and geometric complexity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider an inverse problem involving the simultaneous reconstruction of two real valued potentials for a Schr\"odinger equation with mixed boundary conditions: a dynamic boundary condition of Wentzell type and a Dirichler boundary condition. The main result of this paper is a Lipschitz stability estimate for such potentials from a single measurement of the flux. This result is deduced using the Bukhgeim-Klibanov method and a suitable Carleman estimate where the weight function depends on Minkowski's functional.</description>

      <title>Runway capacity expansion planning for public airports under demand uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flight delay is a significant issue affecting air travel. The runway system, frequently falling short of demand, serves as a bottleneck. As demand increases, runway capacity expansion becomes imperative to mitigate congestion. However, the decision to expand runway capacity is challenging due to inherent uncertainties in demand forecasts. This paper presents a novel approach to modeling air traffic demand growth as a jump diffusion process, incorporating two layers of uncertainty: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for continuous variability and a Poisson process to capture the impact of crisis events, such as natural disasters or public health emergencies, on decision-making. We propose a real options model to jointly evaluate the interrelated factors of optimal runway capacity and investment timing under uncertainty, with investment timing linked to trigger demand. The findings suggest that increased uncertainty indicates more conservative decision-making. Furthermore, the relationship between optimal investment timing and expansion size is complex: if the expansion size remains unchanged, the trigger demand decreases as the demand growth rate increases; if the expansion size experiences a jump, the trigger demand also exhibits a sharp rise. This work provides valuable insights for airport authorities for informed capacity expansion decision-making.</description>

      <title>Early Stopping in Contextual Bandits and Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandit algorithms sequentially accumulate data using adaptive sampling policies, offering flexibility for real-world applications. However, excessive sampling can be costly, motivating the devolopment of early stopping methods and reliable post-experiment conditional inferences. This paper studies early stopping methods in linear contextual bandits, including both pre-determined and online stopping rules, to minimize in-experiment regrets while accounting for sampling costs. We propose stopping rules based on the Opportunity Cost and Threshold Method, utilizing the variances of unbiased or consistent online estimators to quantify the upper regret bounds of learned optimal policy. The study focuses on batched settings for stability, selecting a weighed combination of batched estimators as the online estimator and deriving its asymptotic distribution. Online statistical inferences are performed based on the selected estimator, conditional on the realized stopping time. Our proposed method provides a systematic approach to minimize in-experiment regret and conduct robust post-experiment inferences, facilitating decision-making in future applications.</description>

      <title>Global Contact-Rich Planning with Sparsity-Rich Semidefinite Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that contact-rich motion planning is also sparsity-rich when viewed as polynomial optimization (POP). We can exploit not only the correlative and term sparsity patterns that are general to all POPs, but also specialized sparsity patterns from the robot kinematic structure and the separability of contact modes. Such sparsity enables the design of high-order but sparse semidefinite programming (SDPs) relaxations--building upon Lasserre's moment and sums of squares hierarchy--that (i) can be solved in seconds by off-the-shelf SDP solvers, and (ii) compute near globally optimal solutions to the nonconvex contact-rich planning problems with small certified suboptimality. Through extensive experiments both in simulation (Push Bot, Push Box, Push Box with Obstacles, and Planar Hand) and real world (Push T), we demonstrate the power of using convex SDP relaxations to generate global contact-rich motion plans. As a contribution of independent interest, we release the Sparse Polynomial Optimization Toolbox (SPOT)--implemented in C++ with interfaces to both Python and Matlab--that automates sparsity exploitation for robotics and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer linear programming approaches for tree partitioning of power networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.07000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.</description>

      <title>An Algebraically Converging Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm for Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient descent algorithm with added stochastic terms for finding the global optimizers of nonconvex optimization problems. A key component in the algorithm is the adaptive tuning of the randomness based on the value of the objective function. In the language of simulated annealing, the temperature is state-dependent. With this, we prove the global convergence of the algorithm with an algebraic rate both in probability and in the parameter space. This is a significant improvement over the classical rate from using a more straightforward control of the noise term. The convergence proof is based on the actual discrete setup of the algorithm, not just its continuous limit as often done in the literature. We also present several numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm for reasonably complex objective functions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Augmented Optimization of Large Bilevel and Two-stage Stochastic Programs: Application to Cycling Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of decision problems can be formulated as bilevel programs with independent followers, which as a special case include two-stage stochastic programs. These problems are notoriously difficult to solve especially when a large number of followers present. Motivated by a real-world cycling infrastructure planning application, we present a general approach to solving such problems. We propose an optimization model that explicitly considers a sampled subset of followers and exploits a machine learning model to estimate the objective values of unsampled followers. We prove bounds on the optimality gap of the generated leader decision as measured by the original objective function that considers the full follower set. We then develop follower sampling algorithms to tighten the bounds and a representation learning approach to learn follower features, which are used as inputs to the embedded machine learning model. Through numerical studies, we show that our approach generates leader decisions of higher quality compared to baselines. Finally, in collaboration with the City of Toronto, we perform a real-world case study in Toronto where we solve a cycling network design problem with over one million followers. Compared to the current practice, our approach improves Toronto's cycling accessibility by 19.2%, equivalent to $18M in potential cost savings. Our approach is being used to inform the cycling infrastructure planning in Toronto and outperforms the current practice by a large margin. It can be generalized to any decision problems that are formulated as bilevel programs with independent followers.</description>

      <title>OptScaler: A Collaborative Framework for Robust Autoscaling in the Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoscaling is a critical mechanism in cloud computing, enabling the autonomous adjustment of computing resources in response to dynamic workloads. This is particularly valuable for co-located, long-running applications with diverse workload patterns. The primary objective of autoscaling is to regulate resource utilization at a desired level, effectively balancing the need for resource optimization with the fulfillment of Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Many existing proactive autoscaling frameworks may encounter prediction deviations arising from the frequent fluctuations of cloud workloads. Reactive frameworks, on the other hand, rely on realtime system feedback, but their hysteretic nature could lead to violations of stringent SLOs. Hybrid frameworks, while prevalent, often feature independently functioning proactive and reactive modules, potentially leading to incompatibility and undermining the overall decision-making efficacy. In addressing these challenges, we propose OptScaler, a collaborative autoscaling framework that integrates proactive and reactive modules through an optimization module. The proactive module delivers reliable future workload predictions to the optimization module, while the reactive module offers a self-tuning estimator for real-time updates. By embedding a Model Predictive Control (MPC) mechanism and chance constraints into the optimization module, we further enhance its robustness. Numerical results have demonstrated the superiority of our workload prediction model and the collaborative framework, leading to over a 36% reduction in SLO violations compared to prevalent reactive, proactive, or hybrid autoscalers. Notably, OptScaler has been successfully deployed at Alipay, providing autoscaling support for the world-leading payment platform.</description>

Abstract: Linear-Quadratic optimal controls are computed for a class of boundary controlled, boundary observed hyperbolic infinite-dimensional systems, which may be viewed as networks of waves. The main results of this manuscript consist in converting the infinite-dimensional continuous-time systems into infinite-dimensional discrete-time systems for which the operators dynamics are matrices, in solving the LQ-optimal control problem in discrete-time and then in interpreting the solution in the continuous-time variables, giving rise to the optimal boundary control input. The results are applied to two examples, a small network of three vibrating strings and a co-current heat-exchanger, for which boundary sensors and actuators are considered.</description>

      <title>Maximum stress minimization via data-driven multifidelity topology design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum stress minimization problem is among the most important topics for structural design. The conventional gradient-based topology optimization methods require transforming the original problem into a pseudo-problem by relaxation techniques. Since their parameters significantly influence optimization, accurately solving the maximum stress minimization problem without using relaxation techniques is expected to achieve extreme performance. This paper focuses on this challenge and investigates whether designs with more avoided stress concentrations can be obtained by solving the original maximum stress minimization problem without relaxation techniques, compared to the solutions obtained by gradient-based topology optimization. We employ data-driven multifidelity topology design (MFTD), a gradient-free topology optimization based on evolutionary algorithms. The basic framework involves generating candidate solutions by solving a low-fidelity optimization problem, evaluating these solutions through high-fidelity forward analysis, and iteratively updating them using a deep generative model without sensitivity analysis. In this study, data-driven MFTD incorporates the optimized designs obtained by solving a gradient-based topology optimization problem with the p-norm stress measure in the initial solutions and solves the original maximum stress minimization problem based on a high-fidelity analysis with a body-fitted mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through the benchmark of L-bracket. As a result of solving the original maximum stress minimization problem with data-driven MFTD, a volume reduction of up to 22.6% was achieved under the same maximum stress value, compared to the initial solution.</description>

Abstract: Optimal transportation problem seeks for a coupling $\pi$ of two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ which minimize the total cost $\int c d\pi$, which is linear in $\pi$. In this paper, we introduce a variation of optimal transportation problem which we call quadratic transportation problem that considers a total cost $\iint c d\pi d\pi$ which is quadratic in $\pi$. We compare this problem with other variations of optimal transportation problem, and prove some properties of the solutions to the problem. Then, we introduce squared cost function, which let us consider the total cost $\iint c d\pi d\pi$ as a positive semi-definite bilinear operator on probability measures, and show Kantorovich duality formula when we have a squared cost function.</description>

      <title>Open-source shape optimization for isogeometric shells using FEniCS and OpenMDAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an open-source Python framework for the shape optimization of complex shell structures using isogeometric analysis (IGA). IGA seamlessly integrates computer-aided design (CAD) and analysis models by employing non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as basis functions, enabling the natural implementation of the Kirchhoff--Love shell model due to their higher order of continuity. We leverage the recently developed FEniCS-based analysis framework, PENGoLINS, for the direct structural analysis of shell structures consisting of a collection of NURBS patches through a penalty-based formulation. This contribution introduces the open-source implementation of gradient-based shape optimization for isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells with a modular architecture. Complex shell structures with non-matching intersections are handled using a free-form deformation (FFD) approach and a moving intersections formulation. The symbolic differentiation and code generation capabilities in FEniCS are utilized to compute the analytical derivatives. By integrating FEniCS with OpenMDAO, we build modular components that facilitate gradient-based shape optimization of shell structures. The modular architecture in this work supports future extensions and integration with other disciplines and solvers, making it highly customizable and suitable for a wide range of applications. We validate the design-analysis-optimization workflow through several benchmark problems and demonstrate its application to aircraft wing design optimization. The framework is implemented in a Python library named GOLDFISH (Gradient-based Optimization and Large-scale Design Framework for Isogeometric SHells) and the source code will be maintained at https://github.com/hanzhao2020/GOLDFISH.</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov acceleration. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast and convergent algorithm to solve unassigned distance geometry problems (uDGP). Technically, we construct a novel quadratic measurement model by leveraging $\ell_0$-norm instead of $\ell_1$-norm in the literature. To solve the nonconvex model, we establish its optimality conditions and develop a fast iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that the whole generated sequence converges to the L-stationary point with the help of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. Numerical studies on the turnpike and beltway problems validate its superiority over existing $\ell_1$-norm-based method.</description>

      <title>A qualitative study of the generalized dispersive systems with time-delay: The unbounded case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the time-delayed higher-order dispersive nonlinear differential equation \begin{equation*} u_t(x,t)+Au(x,t) +\lambda_0(x) u(x,t)+\lambda(x) u(x,t-\tau )=0 \end{equation*} where \begin{equation*} Au=(-1)^{j+1}\partial_x^{2j+1}u+(-1)^m\partial_x^{2m}u+ \frac{1}{p+1}\partial_xu^{p+1} \end{equation*} with $m\le j$ and $1\le p&lt;2j$. Under suitable assumptions on the time delay coefficients, we prove that the system is exponentially stable if the coefficient of the delay term is bounded from below by a suitable positive constant, without any assumption on the sign of the coefficient of the undelayed feedback. Additionally, in the absence of delay, general results of stabilization are established in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s\in[0,2j+1]$. Our results generalize several previous theorems for the Korteweg-de Vries type delayed systems in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Self-Supervised Learning for Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become a cornerstone in computer vision, primarily divided into reconstruction-based methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) and discriminative methods such as contrastive learning (CL). Recent empirical observations reveal that MAE and CL capture different types of representations: CL tends to focus on global patterns, while MAE adeptly captures both global and subtle local information simultaneously. Despite a flurry of recent empirical investigations to shed light on this difference, theoretical understanding remains limited, especially on the dominant architecture vision transformers (ViTs). In this paper, to provide rigorous insights, we model the visual data distribution by considering two types of spatial features: dominant global features and comparatively minuscule local features, and study the impact of imbalance among these features. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer softmax-based ViTs on both MAE and CL objectives using gradient descent. Our analysis shows that as the degree of feature imbalance varies, ViTs trained with the MAE objective effectively learn both global and local features to achieve near-optimal reconstruction, while the CL-trained ViTs favor predominantly global features, even under mild imbalance. These results provide a theoretical explanation for distinct behaviors of MAE and CL observed in empirical studies.</description>

      <title>Data Collaboration Analysis with Orthonormal Basis Selection and Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02780v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data Collaboration (DC) analysis offers a privacy-preserving approach to multi-source machine learning by enabling participants to train a shared model without revealing their raw data. Instead, each participant shares only linearly transformed data through a non-iterative communication protocol, thereby mitigating both privacy risks and communication overhead. The core idea of DC is that while each participant obfuscates their data with a secret linear transformation (or basis), the aggregator aligns these secret bases to a chosen target basis \textit{without knowing the secret bases}. Although DC theory suggests that any target basis spanning the same subspace as the secret bases should suffice, empirical evidence reveals that the choice of target basis can substantially influence model performance. To address this discrepancy, we propose \textbf{Orthonormal DC (ODC)}, a novel framework that enforces orthonormal constraints during the basis selection and alignment phases. Unlike conventional DC -- which allows arbitrary target bases -- ODC restricts the target to orthonormal bases, rendering the specific choice of basis negligible concerning model performance. Furthermore, the alignment step in ODC reduces to the \textbf{Orthogonal Procrustes Problem}, which admits a closed-form solution with favorable computational properties. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ODC achieves higher accuracy and improved efficiency compared to existing DC methods, aligning with our theoretical findings. Additional evaluations assess performance in non-ideal scenarios with heterogenous distributions, also showing the best overall performance for our method. These findings position ODC as a direct and effective enhancement to current DC frameworks without compromising privacy or communication overhead when orthonormality constraints are applicable.</description>

      <title>Controllability Problems for the Heat Equation in a Half-Plane Controlled by the Neumann Boundary Condition with a Point-Wise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper, the problems of controllability and approximate controllability are studied for the control system $w_t=\Delta w$, $w_{x_1}(0,x_2,t)=u(t)\delta(x_2)$, $x_1&gt;0$, $x_2\in\mathbb R$, $t\in(0,T)$, where $u\in L^\infty(0,T)$ is a control. To this aid, it is investigated the set $\mathcal{R}_T(0)\subset L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ of its end states which are reachable from $0$. It is established that a function $f\in\mathcal{R}_T(0)$ can be represented in the form $f(x)=g\big(|x|^2\big)$ a.e. in $(0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R$ where $g\in L^2(0,+\infty)$. In fact, we reduce the problem dealing with functions from $L^2((0,+\infty)\times\mathbb R)$ to a problem dealing with functions from $L^2(0,+\infty)$. Both a necessary and sufficient condition for controllability and a sufficient condition for approximate controllability in a given time $T$ under a control $u$ bounded by a given constant are obtained in terms of solvability of a Markov power moment problem. Using the Laguerre functions (forming an orthonormal basis of $L^2(0,+\infty)$), necessary and sufficient conditions for approximate controllability and numerical solutions to the approximate controllability problem are obtained. It is also shown that there is no initial state that is null-controllable in a given time $T$. The results are illustrated by an example.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Exogenous Structure for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: We study Exo-MDPs, a structured class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the state space is partitioned into exogenous and endogenous components. Exogenous states evolve stochastically, independent of the agent's actions, while endogenous states evolve deterministically based on both state components and actions. Exo-MDPs are useful for applications including inventory control, portfolio management, and ride-sharing. Our first result is structural, establishing a representational equivalence between the classes of discrete MDPs, Exo-MDPs, and discrete linear mixture MDPs. Specifically, any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP, and the transition and reward dynamics can be written as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution, showing that Exo-MDPs are instances of linear mixture MDPs. For unobserved exogenous states, we prove a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$ over $K$ trajectories of horizon $H$, with $d$ as the size of the exogenous state space, and establish nearly-matching lower bounds. Our findings demonstrate how Exo-MDPs decouple sample complexity from action and endogenous state sizes, and we validate our theoretical insights with experiments on inventory control.</description>

      <title>Variable Bregman Majorization-Minimization Algorithm and its Application to Dirichlet Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Bregman descent algorithm for minimizing a convex function that is expressed as the sum of a differentiable part (defined over an open set) and a possibly nonsmooth term. The approach, referred to as the Variable Bregman Majorization-Minimization (VBMM) algorithm, extends the Bregman Proximal Gradient method by allowing the Bregman function used in the divergence to adaptively vary at each iteration, provided it satisfies a majorizing condition on the objective function. This adaptive framework enables the algorithm to approximate the objective more precisely at each iteration, thereby allowing for accelerated convergence compared to the traditional Bregman Proximal Gradient descent. We establish the convergence of the VBMM algorithm to a minimizer under mild assumptions on the family of metrics used. Furthermore, we introduce a novel application of both the Bregman Proximal Gradient method and the VBMM algorithm to the estimation of the multidimensional parameters of a Dirichlet distribution through the maximization of its log-likelihood. Numerical experiments confirm that the VBMM algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of convergence speed.</description>
