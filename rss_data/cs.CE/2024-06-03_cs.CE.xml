      <title>Transforming Japan Real Estate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Japanese real estate market, valued over 35 trillion USD, offers significant investment opportunities. Accurate rent and price forecasting could provide a substantial competitive edge. This paper explores using alternative data variables to predict real estate performance in 1100 Japanese municipalities. A comprehensive house price index was created, covering all municipalities from 2005 to the present, using a dataset of over 5 million transactions. This core dataset was enriched with economic factors spanning decades, allowing for price trajectory predictions.
  The findings show that alternative data variables can indeed forecast real estate performance effectively. Investment signals based on these variables yielded notable returns with low volatility. For example, the net migration ratio delivered an annualized return of 4.6% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5. Taxable income growth and new dwellings ratio also performed well, with annualized returns of 4.1% (Sharpe ratio of 1.3) and 3.3% (Sharpe ratio of 0.9), respectively. When combined with transformer models to predict risk-adjusted returns 4 years in advance, the model achieved an R-squared score of 0.28, explaining nearly 30% of the variation in future municipality prices.
  These results highlight the potential of alternative data variables in real estate investment. They underscore the need for further research to identify more predictive factors. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that such data can provide valuable insights into real estate price drivers, enabling more informed investment decisions in the Japanese market.</description>

      <title>VENI, VINDy, VICI: a variational reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions.
  In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy).
  In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>BioT5+: Towards Generalized Biological Understanding with IUPAC Integration and Multi-task Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research trends in computational biology have increasingly focused on integrating text and bio-entity modeling, especially in the context of molecules and proteins. However, previous efforts like BioT5 faced challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks and lacked a nuanced understanding of molecular structures, particularly in their textual representations (e.g., IUPAC). This paper introduces BioT5+, an extension of the BioT5 framework, tailored to enhance biological research and drug discovery. BioT5+ incorporates several novel features: integration of IUPAC names for molecular understanding, inclusion of extensive bio-text and molecule data from sources like bioRxiv and PubChem, the multi-task instruction tuning for generality across tasks, and a numerical tokenization technique for improved processing of numerical data. These enhancements allow BioT5+ to bridge the gap between molecular representations and their textual descriptions, providing a more holistic understanding of biological entities, and largely improving the grounded reasoning of bio-text and bio-sequences. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned with a large number of experiments, including \emph{3 types of problems (classification, regression, generation), 15 kinds of tasks, and 21 total benchmark datasets}, demonstrating the remarkable performance and state-of-the-art results in most cases. BioT5+ stands out for its ability to capture intricate relationships in biological data, thereby contributing significantly to bioinformatics and computational biology.

      <title>ESM All-Atom: Multi-scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ESM-AA (ESM All-Atom), a novel approach that enables atom-scale and residue-scale unified molecular modeling. ESM-AA achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ESM-AA surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ESM-AA not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins. The source codes of ESM-AA are publicly released at https://github.com/zhengkangjie/ESM-AA.</description>
