      <title>Search for emerging jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is presented for emerging jets using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, collected by the ATLAS experiment between 2015 and 2018. The search looks for the existence of a dark sector with symmetries similar to those in quantum chromodynamics. This dark sector is populated with dark quarks, which undergo showering similar to quarks in the Standard Model, leading to a high multiplicity of long-lived dark hadrons within a dark jet. These dark hadrons subsequently decay to Standard Model particles via a new heavy scalar mediating particle $\phi$. This results in jets which contain multiple displaced vertices, known as emerging jets. This analysis targets four-jet topologies, with two emerging jets and two Standard Model jets, resulting from the decay of pair-produced scalar mediators. No significant excess above the Standard Model background is observed. For dark pion proper decay lengths of 20 mm, mediator masses are excluded between 1 TeV and 2 TeV assuming a dark pion mass of 20 GeV.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter production in association with bottom quarks and a lepton pair in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is performed for dark matter produced in association with bottom quarks and a pair of electrons or muons in data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to 138 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. For the first time at the LHC, the associated production of a bottom quark-antiquark pair and a new heavy neutral Higgs boson (H) that subsequently decays into a leptonically decaying Z boson and a pseudoscalar (a) is explored. The latter acts as a dark matter mediator in the context of the two Higgs doublet model plus a pseudoscalar (2HDM+a). Multivariate techniques that target a wide range of mass configurations for the H and a particles are used. The observations are consistent with the expectations from standard model processes. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of cross section and branching fraction of the new particles, ranging from 10$^{-2}$ pb for an H mass of 400 GeV to 10$^{-3}$ pb for an H mass of 2000 GeV. Constraints on the parameter space of a benchmark 2HDM+a model are derived and compared with expectations in the context of cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the tau anomalous magnetic moment using Ultra-peripheral collisions with the ALICE detector in Run 3 Pb-Pb data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton ($a_{\tau}$) is a sensitive probe for the search for deviations from the Standard Model predictions and thus for new physics. This study investigates the feasibility of measuring $a_{\tau}$ using ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at the LHC, where photon-photon interactions ($\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$) produce tau lepton pairs. We focus on events recorded by the ALICE detector during Run 3 Pb-Pb data-taking. Events are selected in the decay channel where one tau decays into an electron and neutrinos, and the other decays into a charged pion, or three charged pions, and neutrinos. These samples are enhanced with decays into muons, which are inseparable in the ALICE detector. The clean environment of UPCs minimizes hadronic background, while the advanced particle identification capabilities of the ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) systems allow for efficient separation of electrons, pions, and background particles. In this talk, prospects for measuring this process by ALICE in Run 3, which benefits from high statistics and improved systematics uncertainties, will be discussed. Results will provide tighter constraints on $a_{\tau}$, contributing to the broader effort to test the Standard Model's robustness and explore physics beyond it.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Efficiency Particle Detection Using Superconducting Microwire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an 8-channel $1\times1$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV hadron beam and 120 GeV muon beam at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron H6 beamline. Following up on our first detailed characterization of the efficiency and response of an SMSPD fabricated on a 3 nm WSi film, we report measurements of enhanced particle detection efficiency using a sensor fabricated from a thicker 4.7nm-thick WSi film. We also report the first SMSPD detection efficiency measurement made for muons. Measurements are enabled by a silicon tracking telescope providing 10 $\mu$m in-situ spatial resolution. The results show a fill factor-normalized detection efficiency of 75% and a time resolution of about 130 ps across pixels. These findings represent a significant advancement toward developing high-efficiency SMSPD charged particle tracking systems with simultaneous precision timing, with potential applications in future accelerator-based experiments such as the FCC-ee and Muon Collider.</description>

      <title>On the Speed-up of Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Entangled Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit-based sensing platforms offer promising new directions for wave-like dark matter searches. Recent proposals demonstrate that entangled qubits can achieve quadratic scaling of the signal in the number of qubits. In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\gtrsim 30{-}40~\mu{\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved. The advantage increases at higher masses where cavity volume scaling becomes less favorable.</description>

      <title>A SHIFT of Perspective: Observing Neutrinos at CMS and ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physics potential of SHIFT@LHC, a proposed gaseous fixed target installed in the LHC tunnel, as a novel source of detectable neutrinos. Using simulations of proton-gas collisions, hadron propagation, and neutrino interactions, we estimate that $O(10^4)$ muon-neutrino and $O(10^3)$ electron-neutrino interactions, spanning energies from 20 GeV to 1 TeV, would occur in the CMS and ATLAS detectors with 1% of the LHC Run-4 integrated luminosity. This unique configuration provides access to hadron production in the pseudorapidity range 5&lt;$\eta$&lt;8, complementary to existing LHC detectors. If realized, this would mark the first detection of neutrinos in a general-purpose LHC detector, opening a new avenue to study neutrino production and interactions in a regime directly relevant to atmospheric neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous global QCD analysis of kaon and pion parton distributions with lattice QCD constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of pion and kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), constrained by pion- and kaon-induced Drell-Yan (DY) and leading neutron electroproduction data, together with lattice QCD data on pion and kaon PDF moments. The analysis indicates a softer valence $\bar u$ distribution in the $K^-$ than in the $\pi^-$, and a significantly more peaked valence $s$-quark density in $K^-$ compared with the $\bar u$. The effective exponent governing the high-$x$ behavior of the PDF is found to be larger for $\bar u$ in the kaon, $\beta_{\bar u}^{K^-}\!= 1.6(2)$, than in the pion, $\beta_{\bar u}^{\pi^-}\!= 1.16(4)$, in the range $0.7 \leq x \leq 0.95$. From the gluon momentum fractions we find the pion's gluon content accounts for $\approx 1/3$ of the mass budget of the pion at $\mu=2~{\rm GeV}$, but only $\approx 1/4$ for the kaon.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Electrolyte Degradation in Lithium-ion Batteries with Neutron Imaging Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.</description>

      <title>An improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an improved perturbative QCD study of the decays $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ ($L$ denotes the light ground state pseudoscalar, vector mesons and the corresponding $p$-wave scalar, axial-vector, and tensor ones) and predict their branching ratios (BRs) associated with relative ratios at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. Our results ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+) =(2.03^{+0.53}_{-0.41}) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \eta_c \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 1.74^{+0.66}_{-0.50}$ are consistent with several available predictions in different approaches within uncertainties. Inputting the measured $\eta_c \to p\bar p$ and $\eta_c \to \pi^+\pi^- (\pi^+\pi^-, K^+ K^-, p\bar p)$ BRs with $p$ here being a proton, we derive the multibody $B_c^+ \to \eta_c (\pi, \rho)^+$ BRs through secondary decay chains via resonance $\eta_c$ under the narrow-width approximation, which might facilitate the (near) future tests of $B_c \to \eta_c$ decays. Under the $q\bar q$ assignment of light scalars, different to $B_c$ decaying into $J/\psi$ plus a scalar meson and other $B_c^+ \to \eta_c L^+$ modes, surprisingly small BRs around ${\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-9})$ of $\Delta S =0$ modes and highly large ratios near ${\cal O}(10^{2})$ between the BRs of $\Delta S=1$ and $\Delta S=0$ modes are found in the $B_c$ decays to $\eta_c$ plus light scalars. Many large BRs and interesting ratios presented in this work could be tested at the LHC experiments, which would help us to examine the reliability of this improved perturbative QCD formalism for $B_c$-meson decays and further understand the QCD dynamics in the considered decay modes, as well as in the related hadrons.</description>

      <title>Constraining Heavy Neutral Leptons Coupled to the Tau-Neutrino Flavor at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Displaced vertex (DV) signatures at colliders offer a powerful probe of new long-lived particles beyond the Standard Model. Among the best-motivated candidates are heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) - heavier counterparts of Standard Model neutrinos - which can account for the origin of neutrino masses and potentially produce di-leptonic DV signatures.
  In this study, we demonstrate how existing DV searches at the LHC can be extended to probe HNLs that couple predominantly to the tau-neutrino flavor. While current search strategies rely on identifying a prompt lepton alongside a displaced vertex, we show that analyzing events without a prompt lepton enables sensitivity to the process $pp \to W \to \tau N$, where the tau decays hadronically and the HNL subsequently decays to a lepton pair and a neutrino.
  We perform detailed Monte Carlo simulations of this process with HNLs decaying to $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$ final states, apply ATLAS-inspired selection criteria, and optimize signal sensitivity. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate cuts in the plane of di-lepton invariant mass and DV radial position significantly enhance signal visibility. We propose several such optimized strategies and show that even with Run 2 data $139~\text{fb}^{-1}$ , existing bounds can be improved by more than an order of magnitude. Future high-luminosity runs may strengthen sensitivity by up to three orders of magnitude compared to current limits.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Muon Polarization to Facilitate Atmospheric Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos (ATNs) offer a paradigm for understanding neutrino properties, while it is critical to quantify uncertainties in flux modeling. Since ATNs are produced simultaneously with cosmic ray muons, precision measurements of cosmic ray muons, including arrival direction, energy spectra, and spin polarization, will help reduce ATN production uncertainties and facilitate atmospheric neutrino physics. This letter proposes using an array strategy to measure the spin polarization of cosmic ray muons, thereby strengthening the emergent synergies between cosmic ray and atmospheric neutrino physics. Constraints on long-standing atmospheric neutrino flux uncertainties at the percentage level in a few-GeV energy range are achievable within one year using a $O(10)~\text{m}^2$ array of Cosmic-Ray muon Spin polarization detectoRs (CRmuSRs). With the resulting reduction in flux uncertainties, oscillation analysis of atmospheric neutrinos in a liquid scintillator detector with an exposure of 1500 $\text{kt}\cdot\text{yr}$ will break the octant degeneracy and achieve the precision measurement of $\theta_{23}$ with the uncertainty smaller than $5${\deg} at 3$\sigma$ confidence level irrespective of the mass ordering.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes how intentional and unintentional radio emission from airplanes is recorded with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G). We characterize the received signals and define a procedure to extract a clean set of impulsive signals. These signals are highly suitable for instrument calibration, also for future experiments. A set of signals is used to probe the timing precision of RNO-G in-situ, which is found to match expectations. We also discuss the impact of these signals on the ability to detect neutrinos with RNO-G.</description>

      <title>dN/dx Reconstruction with Deep Learning for High-Granularity TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle identification (PID) is essential for future particle physics experiments such as the Circular Electron-Positron Collider and the Future Circular Collider. A high-granularity Time Projection Chamber (TPC) not only provides precise tracking but also enables dN/dx measurements for PID. The dN/dx method estimates the number of primary ionization electrons, offering significant improvements in PID performance. However, accurate reconstruction remains a major challenge for this approach. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning model, the Graph Point Transformer (GraphPT), for dN/dx reconstruction. In our approach, TPC data are represented as point clouds. The network backbone adopts a U-Net architecture built upon graph neural networks, incorporating an attention mechanism for node aggregation specifically optimized for point cloud processing. The proposed GraphPT model surpasses the traditional truncated mean method in PID performance. In particular, the $K/\pi$ separation power improves by approximately 10% to 20% in the momentum interval from 5 to 20 GeV/c.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, non-thermal productions via the freeze-in and SuperWIMP mechanism are also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Constraining anomalous $W tb$ and related SMEFT couplings using low-energy and electroweak precision observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on couplings of Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) operators contributing to $Wtb$ effective vertex at tree level. We study the one-loop level impact of these couplings on the low-energy flavour changing charged and neutral current processes and on the electroweak precision observables. We use the available data on these relevant processes to constrain the associated SMEFT/$Wtb$ couplings. Solving the renormalisation group equations, we connect the SMEFT couplings at different scales and use the bounds at low energy to obtain the relevant bounds at the large scale $\Lambda$. Our findings indicate significantly improved constraints on the couplings compared to existing constraints on $Wtb$ couplings by ATLAS and CMS. Additionally, we predict branching ratios for various top-FCNC processes, which exceed SM expectations by several orders of magnitude but remain within the reach of future colliders. These SMEFT couplings, or anomalous couplings of the effective $Wtb$ vertex, can further constrain different UV-complete and simplified models that generate such interactions at the tree or loop level.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and charge multiplication in liquid xenon with a VCC-like Microstrip Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first observation of electroluminescence and charge amplification with a Virtual Cathode Chamber (VCC) microstrips plate immersed in liquid xenon. Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $&lt;$10. Further investigations are necessary to understand and mitigate the light yield degradation phenomenon. We expect other substrate materials, including VUV-transparent ones, to provide large stable photon yields, compatible with our model predictions. The VCC configuration has demonstrated great potential in single-phase noble-liquid detectors, particularly for dark-matter searches, neutrino physics and other fields.</description>

      <title>In-pixel integration of signal processing and AI/ML based data filtering for particle tracking detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first physical realization of in-pixel signal processing with integrated AI-based data filtering for particle tracking detectors. Building on prior work that demonstrated a physics-motivated edge-AI algorithm suitable for ASIC implementation, this work marks a significant milestone toward intelligent silicon trackers. Our prototype readout chip performs real-time data reduction at the sensor level while meeting stringent requirements on power, area, and latency. The chip is taped-out in 28nm TSMC CMOS bulk process, which has been shown to have sufficient radiation hardness for particle experiments. This development represents a key step toward enabling fully on-detector edge AI, with broad implications for data throughput and discovery potential in high-rate, high-radiation environments such as the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>
