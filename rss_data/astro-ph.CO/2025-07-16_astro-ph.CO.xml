      <title>CHEX-MATE: Cluster Multi-Probes in Three Dimensions (CLUMP-3D) II. Combined Gas and Dark Matter Analysis from X-ray, SZE, and WL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the standard model of hierarchical structure formation, the overall geometry of galaxy clusters is better described by a triaxial ellipse than a sphere. As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in significant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model, requiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to describe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based on the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure formation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from Planck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous development of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I. We apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689) and find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of sky by a factor of $\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \pm 0.02$. As a result, the WL mass obtained from our triaxial fit, $\text{M}_{200c}=(13.69_{-1.41}^{+1.56})\times10^{14} \text{M}_{\odot}$, is significantly lower than the value of $(17.77_{-1.75}^{+2.00})\times10^{14} \text{M}_{\odot}$ obtained from a spherically-symmetric fit that otherwise employs the same methodology. Our triaxial fit finds a concentration of $c_{200c}=8.55_{-1.61}^{+2.20}$, consistent with the spherically-symmetric value of $9.99_{-1.78}^{+2.26}$, which suggests that the unexpectedly high concentration in Abell 1689 is not due to triaxiality and orientation. We also measure the non-thermal pressure fraction at radii between 0.18-1.37 Mpc, finding a minimum of approximately 20 per cent at intermediate radii increasing to near 30 per cent at both the smallest and largest radii, and with a typical measurement precision of $\pm$5 per cent.</description>

      <title>Testing Planck 2020 and DESI data on wCDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS survey quasar selection V: combined algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a variety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up, measurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift estimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of machine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning algorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual algorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We include results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved photometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated data and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$ score, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We evaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In this scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes, reaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\geq2.1$ and $z&lt;2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its performance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We conclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version of the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks suggest a typical uncertainty of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to our results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large enough for a full statistical consideration.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.</description>

      <title>From Redshift to Real Space: Combining Linear Theory With Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift surveys are key tools to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and test the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, using redshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy distribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in LSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method that combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift space distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on dark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations. LT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns quasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then the NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales. The method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant performance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN alone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger correlations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately. The hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and halo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to NN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and quasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation functions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical model with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both approaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data and computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to more realistic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We find the relation to be statistically consistent with the current data. We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignment demographics for next-generation lensing: Revealing galaxy property trends with DESI Y1 direct measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11530v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct measurements of the intrinsic alignments (IA) of over 2 million spectroscopic galaxies using DESI Data Release 1 and imaging from four lensing surveys: DES, HSC, KiDS, and SDSS. In this uniquely data-rich regime, we take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building a library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and redshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame colour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate -- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with zero, across low ($0.05&lt;z&lt;0.5$) and high ($0.8&lt;z&lt;1.55$) redshifts. In order to construct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain maximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment with colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the amplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated with stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between $0&lt;z&lt;1.5$, trends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments we measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion paper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA signals with significant detections, including model comparison. Finally, to direct efforts for future IA measurements, we juxtapose the colour-magnitude-redshift coverage of existing IA measurements against modern and future lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06106v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz) powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 &lt; z &lt; 2, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18{\deg}, 23{\deg}, and 33{\deg} at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</description>

      <title>Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Asymgenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework based on the standard type-I seesaw model that relates the baryon asymmetry of the universe to the dark matter (DM) density. The framework, which we name "Asymgenesis", relies on the presence of primordial charge asymmetries seeded either in the dark sector or in the visible sector. A higher-dimensional portal operator reshuffles this initial asymmetry into both sectors, eventually resulting in a nonzero $B-L$ asymmetry and an asymmetric DM component. Compared to conventional asymmetric-dark-matter (ADM) schemes, our framework imposes far milder requirements on the portal interaction. In particular, the portal interaction need not violate $B-L$, and the temperature scales of efficient $B-L$ violation and efficient charge-transfer interaction mediated by the portal operator can be separated. We develop the formalism in detail and argue that the flexibility of our framework enlarges the model-building landscape for ADM.</description>

      <title>Absolute Calibration of Cluster Mira Variables to Provide a New Anchor for the Hubble Constant Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10658</link>

Abstract: Mira variables in globular clusters can provide an accurate and precise absolute calibration of their period-luminosity relations (PLRs) to independently anchor the cosmic distance scale and determine the Hubble constant. We present homogeneous near-infrared ($JHK_s$) time-series photometric observations of a sample of 55 candidate long-period variables in 18 globular clusters covering a wide metallicity range ($-1.7 &lt; \textrm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -0.1$ dex). The Gaia proper motions, long-period variability information, and optical-infrared colors are used to identify 41 Oxygen-rich Miras as members of the globular clusters. Mean luminosities of Miras in the $JHK_s$ bands are independently calibrated using the recommended distances and mean parallaxes to their host clusters. Cluster Mira PLRs exhibit scatter comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) variables and do not show any dependence on iron-abundance for a wide range of metallicities. We establish the accuracy of cluster Miras as independent anchors by determining a distance modulus to the LMC, $18.45 \pm 0.04$ mag, in agreement with the 1.2\% precise geometric distance. Our $H$-band photometry is transformed to derive {\it Hubble Space Telescope} F160W PLR for cluster Miras providing a three-anchor baseline with the LMC and NGC 4258. We employ three-anchor solution to determine distances to two type Ia supernovae host galaxies, NGC 1559 ($31.39\pm0.05$ mag) and M101 ($29.07\pm0.04$ mag), and provide a $3.7\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 73.06\pm 2.67$ km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Similar to Cepheids, our independent baseline solution results in a local $H_0$ determination that is systematically larger than its inference from the early universe probes, further supporting the ongoing Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Little Red Dots in the Local Universe: Signatures of Cool Gas Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift "little red dots" (LRDs) that challenge conventional AGN models. We report the discovery of three local LRDs at $z = 0.1-0.2$, initially selected from the SDSS database, with follow-up optical/near-IR spectroscopy and photometry. They exhibit properties fully consistent with those of high-redshift LRDs, including broad hydrogen and helium emission lines, compact morphologies, V-shaped UV-optical SED, declining near-IR continua, and no significant variability. Two sources were targeted but not detected in X-rays with statistical significance. All three sources show blue-shifted He I absorption, while two exhibit H$\alpha$ and Na D absorption lines. We detect full Balmer and Paschen line series in all three objects, along with abundant narrow [Fe II] emission in two. The emission line analyses suggest narrow lines originate from AGN-powered metal-poor regions with minimal dust; broad lines come from inner regions with exceptionally high density or atypical dust properties; and [Fe II] emission arises from dense gas between broad and narrow-line regions. One of our objects, J1025+1402 (nicknamed "The Egg"), shows extremely high equivalent width Na D, K I, Fe II, and Ca II triplet absorption lines, suggesting the presence of a cool ($\sim$5000 K), metal-enriched gas envelope. The optical/near-IR continua of these LRDs are also consistent with theoretical models featuring an atmosphere around black holes. The WISE-detected IR emission is consistent with weak dust emission of $T \sim 10^2-10^3$ K. We propose a conceptual model consisting of a largely thermalized cool-gas envelope surrounding the central black hole and an extended emission line region with high-density outflowing gas to explain the observed properties of these local LRDs.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Minimal Dark Sectors via the 21 cm Line at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near the end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new physics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that decay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of decaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening photon decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then shifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The analysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM component alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector of nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general parameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities allows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit realizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM interacting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios illustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise inaccessible regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Based Inference Approach to the Dynamics of the MW-LMC System -- Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way (MW) has generated dynamical disequilibrium throughout the MW. The interaction has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an apparent 'reflex motion' in velocities of outer halo stars. Often, expensive high fidelity MW--LMC simulations are required to model these effects, though the range of model parameter spaces can be large and complex. We investigate the ability of lower fidelity, rigid MW-LMC simulations to reliably infer the model parameters of higher fidelity N-body and hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in MW--LMC simulations using a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) approach. We produce and release a set of 128,000 MW--LMC rigid potentials, with stellar haloes evolved to present-day, each adopting a unique combination of model parameters including the MW mass, the LMC mass and the dynamical friction strength. For these simulation parameters, we use SBI to find their posterior distributions. We find that our SBI framework trained on rigid MW--LMC simulations is able to correctly infer the true simulation LMC mass within a $1\sigma$ confidence interval from both N-body and cosmological simulations when knowledge of the induced MW reflex motion is provided as data. This motivates future applications of the presented SBI framework to observational data, which will help constrain both MW and LMC properties, as well as the dynamics of the MW's reflex motion.</description>

      <title>LATIS: A Sample of IGM-selected Protoclusters and Protogroups at $z \sim 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS) has produced large 3D maps of the intergalactic medium (IGM), providing a new window on the cosmic web at $z\sim2.5$. A key advantage of Ly$\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the discovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members in spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these maps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and spatially coherent Ly$\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of these are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass $M_{\rm desc} &gt; 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are protogroups ($10^{13.5} &lt; M_{\rm desc} / M_{\odot} &lt; 10^{14}$). We estimate the masses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are in accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some previously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion. We identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We show that the Ly$\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within Hyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback or other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this structure as whole. The LATIS catalog represents an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of IGM-selected protogroups and protoclusters and will enable new investigations of the connections between galaxies and their large-scale environments at cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>LATIS: Comparing Galaxy and IGM Tomography Maps as Tracers of Large-scale Structure and Protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency of intergalactic medium (IGM) tomography and galaxy surveys as tracers of the cosmic web and protoclusters at $z \sim 2.5$. We use maps from the Ly$\alpha$ Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which trace the distributions of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and IGM Ly$\alpha$ absorption on $\simeq 4$ $h^{-1}$ cMpc scales within the same large volume. Overall, the joint distribution of IGM absorption and LBG density is well constrained and accurately described by a simple physical model. However, we identify several exceptional locations exhibiting strong IGM absorption indicative of a massive protocluster, yet no coincident overdensity of LBGs. As discussed by Newman et al., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are candidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy populations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up observations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended region of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected protoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \times 10^{15}~M_{\odot}$. Ly$\alpha$ emitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the candidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no submillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is needed to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with reduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and puzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers, whose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of environment-dependent galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>GeV-scale thermal dark matter from dark photons: tightly constrained, yet allowed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GeV-scale thermal dark matter (DM) is highly constrained by the null results of both direct and indirect detection experiments, especially in the context of simplified models. In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and indirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model that includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\chi$. We take into account in a consistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals when the relic abundance of $\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM density (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a consequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions with large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading constraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the (invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with large kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and direct detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to $m_\chi\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early universe, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark sector coupling is required: $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$ GeV, or $\alpha_D~\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV. The remaining areas of the parameter space can be probed in a complementary way by future direct detection experiments (which will narrow down the allowed area around the resonant region) and collider searches (which will set limits for smaller values of the kinetic mixing).</description>

Abstract: We study stimulated emission and absorption of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state immersed in a thermal radiation bath. Employing one-loop interaction-picture perturbation theory, we track the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in the squeezed vacuum, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. In a Minkowski background with a thermal bath as a toy example, we demonstrate that the net graviton emission or absorption rate depends sensitively on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors operating in radiation at temperatures of order 0.1 GeV and find that graviton occupation numbers at frequencies of order 100 Hz can be significantly enhanced, suggesting a novel mechanism for amplifying gravitational-wave signals. Although these conditions exceed current experimental capabilities, they point toward potential future advances in detection. Extending our analysis to an expanding, radiation-dominated universe, we show that subhorizon gravitons undergo stimulated absorption, while superhorizon modes exhibit secular logarithmic growth, indicating the breakdown of perturbative methods and motivating further investigation. These findings open a new direction for exploring graviton coherence effects in realistic cosmological and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution of CIV Absorbers at $1.4&lt;z&lt;4.5$: Insights from $100,000$ Systems in DESI Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the largest catalog to date of triply ionized carbon (CIV) absorbers detected in quasar spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify $101,487$ CIV systems in the redshift range $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 4.5$ from $300,637$ quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations and catalog is $50\%$ complete at $\mathrm{EW}_{\mathrm{CIV}} \geq 0.4$ Angstroms. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of $2-5$ from $z \approx 4.5$ to $z \approx 1.4$, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of CIV, $\Omega_{\mathrm{CIV}}$, which increases by a factor of $\sim 3.8$ from $(0.82 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 4.5$ to $(3.16 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{-8}$ at $z \approx 1.4$. From $\Omega_{\rm CIV}$, we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity $\log(Z_{\rm IGM}/Z_{\odot}) \gtrsim -3.25$ at $z \sim 2.3$, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and HeII photoheating rate, suggesting a link between CIV enrichment, star formation, and UV background over $\sim 3$ Gyr. The catalog also provides a critical resource for future studies connecting circumgalactic metals to galaxy evolution, especially near cosmic noon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields on cosmological scales opens up a window into the physics of the early Universe. Numerical simulations of such fields require a careful treatment to faithfully solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) without introducing numerical artefacts. In this paper, we study the growth of the magnetic fields in controlled kinematic dynamo setups using both smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementations in the SWIFT code. We assess the quality of the reconstructed solution in the Roberts flow case against the reference implementation in the Pencil code and find generally a good agreement. Similarly, we reproduce the known features of the more complex ABC flow. Using a simple induction-diffusion balance model to analyse the results, we construct an "overwinding" trigger metric to locally detect regions where the magnetic diffusion cannot counteract the expected induction because of limitations in the method's ability to resolve magnetic field gradients. This metric is then used to identify the necessary resolution and resistivity levels to counteract the overwinding problem. We finally apply this metric to adiabatic cosmological simulations and discuss the resolution requirements needed to resolve the growth of the primordial fields without artefacts.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity with data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a Universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various paradigmatic choices of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law, exponential, and logarithmic models, are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these $f(Q)$ gravity models, we use {the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations ($BAO$) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey, cosmic chronometers ($CC$) from Hubble measurements, the SNIa distance moduli measurements from the PantheonP + SH0ES, growth rate ($f$-data), and redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets, the latter two once the linear cosmological perturbations, growth rate $f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$ are studied. Thus, we perform the combined analyses for: PantheonP + SH0ES, PantheonP + SH0ES + f, and PantheonP + SH0ES + $f\sigma_8$. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m$, $H_0\,\mathrm{(km/s/Mpc)}$, $r_d$, $M_{abs}$, $\gamma$, $\sigma_8$, $n$, $p$ and $\Gamma$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$. Through a detailed statistical analysis, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with $\Lambda$CDM is made. Among the three $f(Q)$ models, only the non-viscous $f(Q)$ power-law model yields robust parameter estimates and substantial observational support without any outright rejections. In contrast, both exponential and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models (with or without bulk viscosity) are rejected by multiple model selection criteria.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential at the MATHUSLA experiment of a long-lived particle (LLP), which is the heavier state of inelastic scalar dark matter (DM) in third generation-philic $U(1)$ ($U(1)_{X_3}$) extension of the standard model. Since the heavier state and DM state form the complex scalar charged under the $U(1)_{X_3}$, it is natural that the heavier state $P$ is almost degenerate with the DM state and hence long-lived. We find that third generation-philic right-handed $U(1)$, $U(1)_{R_3}$, model is the most interesting, because third generation-philic models are less constrained by the current experimental results and right-handed $U(1)$ interactions leave visible final decay products without produing neutrinos. For a benchmark of the model parameters consistent with the current phenomenological constraints, we find that the travel distance of the LLP can be $\mathcal{O}(100)$ m and the LLP production cross section at the 14 TeV LHC can be $\mathcal{O}(10)$ fb. Thus, we conclude that the LLP can be discovered at the MATHUSLA with a sufficiently large number of LLP decay events inside the MATHUSLA detector.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in astronomical machine learning is a systematic bias where predictions compress the dynamic range of true values-high values are consistently predicted too low while low values are predicted too high. Understanding this bias has important consequences for astronomical measurements and our understanding of physical processes in astronomical inference. Through analytical examination of linear regression, we show that this bias arises naturally from measurement uncertainties in input features and persists regardless of training sample size, label accuracy, or parameter distribution. In the univariate case, we demonstrate that attenuation becomes important when the ratio of intrinsic signal range to measurement uncertainty ($\sigma_{\text{range}}/\sigma_x$) is below $O(10)$-a regime common in astronomy. We further extend the theoretical framework to multivariate linear regression and demonstrate its implications using stellar spectroscopy as a case study. Even under optimal conditions-high-resolution APOGEE-like spectra ($R=24,000$) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR=100) and multiple correlated features-we find percent-level bias. The effect becomes even more severe for modern-day low-resolution surveys like LAMOST and DESI due to the lower SNR and resolution. These findings have broad implications, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and addressing this limitation in astronomical data analysis with machine learning.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are observed to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate constant density cores in their centers. These do not arise naturally from dark matter only simulations, giving rise to the ``core-cusp'' problem. Hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback can create cored profiles, but this solution requires some fine tuning. Additionally, there is a related ``diversity'' problem in which simulations cannot reproduce the large range in rotation curve shapes for galaxies of similar mass. Here we investigate, for the first time, whether a theoretical model based on statistical mechanics (DARKexp) can produce flat density cores with its single shape parameter. We find that these theoretical profiles are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~ 20-200 km/s by producing fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies covering this range. We additionally show that the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores are also well fit, and that wave, or fuzzy dark matter is unable to fit the full range of SPARC galaxies. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves in these dark matter dominated galaxies with cold collisionless dark matter alone, i.e., without introducing baryonic feedback, or alternative nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx Ly$\alpha$ intensity maps and a hypothetical galaxy survey is observable with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Bridging Machine Learning and Cosmological Simulations: Using Neural Operators to emulate Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational expense of solving non-equilibrium chemistry equations in astrophysical simulations poses a significant challenge, particularly in high-resolution, large-scale cosmological models. In this work, we explore the potential of machine learning, specifically Neural Operators, to emulate the Grackle chemistry solver, which is widely used in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Neural Operators offer a mesh-free, data-driven approach to approximate solutions to coupled ordinary differential equations governing chemical evolution, gas cooling, and heating. We construct and train multiple Neural Operator architectures (DeepONet variants) using a dataset derived from cosmological simulations to optimize accuracy and efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the trained models accurately reproduce Grackle's outputs with an average error of less than 0.6 dex in most cases, though deviations increase in highly dynamic chemical environments. Compared to Grackle, the machine learning models provide computational speedups of up to a factor of six in large-scale simulations, highlighting their potential for reducing computational bottlenecks in astrophysical modeling. However, challenges remain, particularly in iterative applications where accumulated errors can lead to numerical instability. Additionally, the performance of these machine learning models is constrained by their need for well-represented training datasets and the limited extrapolation capabilities of deep learning methods. While promising, further development is required for Neural Operator-based emulators to be fully integrated into astrophysical simulations. Future work should focus on improving stability over iterative timesteps and optimizing implementations for hardware acceleration. This study provides an initial step toward the broader adoption of machine learning approaches in astrophysical chemistry solvers.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in Cotton gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The framework of General Relativity (GR) has recently been expanded through the introduction of Cotton Gravity (CG), a theoretical extension proposed by J. Harada. This modified approach integrates the Cotton tensor into the gravitational field equations, naturally encompassing all conventional GR solutions while allowing the cosmological constant to emerge as an integration constant. In this study, we delve into the implications of CG when coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), constructing and analyzing three distinct static, spherically symmetric configurations. Our investigation centers on the horizon structure, metric characteristics, and the underlying NLED Lagrangian density of each model. We also confront the theoretical predictions with observational data by comparing the calculated shadow radii of these solutions to constraints imposed by the Event Horizon Telescope's (EHT) measurements of Sgr A$^{*}$. The results reveal an extensive spectrum of spacetime geometries, ranging from multi-horizon structures to naked singularities. Furthermore, the agreement between the predicted shadow sizes and EHT observations reinforces the viability of these models in describing the astrophysical image of Sgr A$^{*}$ within certain parameter bounds.</description>

      <title>Core collapse in resonant self-interacting dark matter across two decades in halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core collapse, a process associated with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, can increase the central density of halos by orders of magnitude with observable consequences for dwarf galaxy properties and gravitational lensing. Resonances in the self-interaction cross section, features of hidden-sector models with light mediators and attractive potentials, can boost the strength of self-interactions near specific relative velocities, accelerating collapse in halos with central velocity dispersions near the resonance. To explore this phenomenon, we present a suite of idealized N-body simulations of isolated halos with masses $10^7$-$10^9 \ \rm{M_\odot}$ evolved under two resonant cross section (RCS) models with localized enhancement to the cross section on scales $v \sim 5$-$50 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. We show that the change in halo internal structure depends on how the velocity distribution of bound particles moves across resonances in the cross section during core formation and collapse. The interplay between the velocity distribution of bound particles and localized features of the cross section causes deviations from self-similar evolution, a characteristic of velocity-independent cross sections, at the level of up to $20\%$. Depending on the alignment with resonant features, halos of different masses reach different evolutionary stages after a fixed physical time and develop diverse density profiles and rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Formation of Supersonic Turbulence in the Primordial Star-forming Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.</description>

      <title>First release of LiteBIRD simulations from an end-to-end pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LiteBIRD satellite mission aims at detecting Cosmic Microwave Background $B$ modes with unprecedented precision, targeting a total error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\delta r \sim 0.001$. Operating from the L2 Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, LiteBIRD will survey the full sky across 15 frequency bands (34 to 448 GHz) for 3 years.The current LiteBIRD baseline configuration employs 4508 detectors sampling at 19.1 Hz to achieve an effective polarization sensitivity of $ 2 \mu\mathrm{K-arcmin}$ and an angular resolution of 31 arcmin (at 140 GHz).We describe the first release of the official LiteBIRD simulations, realized with a new simulation pipeline developed using the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework.This pipeline generates 500 full-sky simulated maps at a Healpix resolution of nside=512. The simulations include also one year of Time Ordered Data for approximately one-third of LiteBIRD's total detectors.</description>
