      <title>Partially ordered semigroups and groups with two mixed partial orderings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixed lattice is a partially ordered set with two mixed partial orderings that are linked by asymmetric upper and lower envelopes. These notions generalize the join and meet operations of a lattice. In the present paper, we study different types of partially ordered semigroups with two mixed orderings, and investigate their relationship to subsemigroups of mixed lattice groups, which are partially ordered groups with a similar order structure. We also consider Archimedean orderings, and we show that elements of finite order cannot exist in a rather general class of Archimedean mixed lattice groups. Moreover, we give an example of a non-Archimedean mixed lattice group that contains an element of finite order.</description>

      <title>Subgroup Conjugacy Separability in Residually Free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that finitely presented residually free groups are subgroup conjugacy separable. Furthermore, if they are of type $FP_\infty$, then they are also subgroup conjugacy distinguished.
  Using a connection between conjugacy separability and residual finiteness of outer automorphism group established by Grossman in \cite{Grossman}, we show that finitely presented residually free groups have residually finite outer automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of coarse median structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any product of bushy hyperbolic spaces has a unique coarse median structure, and that having a unique coarse median structure is a property closed under relative hyperbolicity. As a consequence, in contrast with the case of mapping class groups, there are non-hyperbolic pants graphs that have unique coarse median structures.</description>

      <title>Girth of the Cayley graph and Cayley hash functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cayley hash functions are based on a simple idea of using a pair of semigroup elements, A and B, to hash the 0 and 1 bit, respectively, and then to hash an arbitrary bit string in the natural way, by using multiplication of elements in the semigroup. The main advantage of Cayley hash functions compared to, say, hash functions in the SHA family is that when an already hashed document is amended, one does not have to hash the whole amended document all over again, but rather hash just the amended part and then multiply the result by the hash of the original document. In this article, we survey some of the previously proposed Cayley hash functions and single out a very simple hash function whose security has not been compromised up to date.</description>

Abstract: We consider when the projective special linear group over a finite field defines a $3$-design with a cyclic starter block. We will show that the equivalences of the existence of such $3$-$(q+1,5,3)$ and $3$-$(q+1,10,18)$ designs for a prime power $q\equiv 1\pmod{20}$, and $3$-$(q+1,13,33)$ and $3$-$(q+1,26,150)$ designs for a prime power $q\equiv 1\pmod{52}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>On schurity of dihedral groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is called a Schur group if every $S$-ring over $G$ is schurian, i.e. associated in a natural way with a subgroup of $Sym(G)$ that contains all right translations. One of the crucial questions in the $S$-ring theory is the question on schurity of nonabelian groups, in particular, on existence of an infinite family of nonabelian Schur groups. In this paper, we study schurity of dihedral groups. We show that any generalized dihedral Schur group is dihedral and obtain necessary conditions of schurity for dihedral groups. Further, we prove that a dihedral group of order $2p$, where $p$ is a Fermat prime or prime of the form $p=4q+1$, where $q$ is also prime, is Schur. Towards this result, we prove nonexistence of a difference set in a cyclic group of order $p\neq 13$ and classify all $S$-rings over some dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Classifying finite groups G with three Aut(G)-orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete and irredundant list of the finite groups $G$ for which Aut$(G)$, acting naturally on $G$, has precisely $3$ orbits. There are 7 infinite families: one abelian, one non-nilpotent, three families of non-abelian $2$-groups and two families of non-abelian $p$-groups with $p$ odd. The non-abelian $2$-group examples were first classified by Bors and Glasby in 2020 and non-abelian $p$-group examples with $p$ odd were classified independently by Li and Zhu, and by the author, in March 2024.</description>

      <title>The Moufang Condition and Root Automorphisms for Spherical Buildings of Rank 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give direct, geometric constructions for nontrivial root elations for rank $2$ residues of higher rank buildings $\Delta$ of type $\mathsf{B_n}, \mathsf{C_n}$ and $\mathsf{H_m}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $m \in \{3,4\}$. We show that we can extend these to the ambient building in the case that $\Delta$ has type $\mathsf{B_n}$ or $\mathsf{C_n}$. With that, we obtain a different proof for the fact that buildings of type $\mathsf{B_n}$ and $\mathsf{C_n}$ are Moufang. This geometric approach enables us to gain more insight into the root groups associated to these buildings and we obtain new results; Namely, that certain root elations generically fix more points than we previously knew and that every root elation in each point residual can be written as an even self-projectivity. Concerning $\mathsf{H_m}$, we will be able to see in a novel way why thick, spherical buildings of type $\mathsf{H_m}$ cannot exist. Altogther, this provides an alternative proof for the fact that all thick, irreducible, spherical buildings $\Delta$ of rank 3 have the Moufang property.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of triples of transverse partial flags in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ and Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on descents, inversions and the weak order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the notion of partition of elements in an arbitrary Coxeter system $(W,S)$: a partition of an element $w$ is a subset $\mathcal P\subseteq W$ such that the left inversion set of $w$ is the disjoint union of the left inversion set of the elements in $\mathcal P$. Partitions of elements of $W$ arises in the study of the Belkale-Kumar product on the cohomology $H^*(X,\mathbb Z)$, where $X$ is the complete flag variety of any complex semi-simple algebraic group. Partitions of elements in the symmetric group $\mathcal S_n$ are also related to the {\em Babington-Smith model} in algebraic statistics or to the simplicial faces of the Littlewood-Richardson cone.
  We state the conjecture that the number of right descents of $w$ is the sum of the number of right descents of the elements of $\mathcal P$ and prove that this conjecture holds in the cases of symmetric groups (type $A$) and hyperoctahedral groups (type $B$).</description>
