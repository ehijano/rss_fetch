      <title>On the Limits of Self-Improving in LLMs and Why AGI, ASI and the Singularity Are Not Near Without Symbolic Model Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($\alpha_t \to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Covert Communications via Intelligent Spectrum Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of multi-user covert communications over a fixed bandwidth in a multi-cell scenario with both eavesdroppers and malicious jammers. We propose an intelligent spectrum control (ISC) scheme that combines high-accuracy spectrum sensing with AI-assisted real-time decision-making to generate time-frequency dynamic occupation patterns for multiple legitimate users. The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints. Simulation results confirm the tight match between the analytical and Monte Carlo curves, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher DEP, a larger RTP, and a greater multi-user capacity than the benchmark scheme.</description>

      <title>Secure Communication via Modulation Order Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing threat posed by modulation classification to wireless security, this paper proposes a secure communication framework based on modulation order confusion (MOC), which intentionally disguises the original modulation as a higher- or lower-order one to mislead eavesdroppers. For single-antenna systems, two schemes are developed: symbol random mapping and symbol time diversity, enabling modulation order confusion with customized receivers. For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively defeat both deep-learning-based and expert-knowledge-based modulation classifiers without degrading communication performance.</description>

      <title>The Number of Cycles of Bi-regular Tanner Graphs in Terms of the Eigenvalues of the Adjacency Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore new connections between the cycles in the graph of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix. The resulting observations are used to derive fast, simple, recursive formulas for the number of cycles $N_{2k}$ of length $2k$, $k&lt;g$, in a bi-regular graph of girth $g$. Moreover, we derive explicit formulas for $N_{2k}$, $k\leq 7$, in terms of the nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. Throughout, we focus on the practically interesting class of bi-regular quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, for which the eigenvalues can be obtained efficiently by applying techniques used for block-circulant matrices.</description>

      <title>Strong Singleton-Like Bounds, Quasi-Perfect Codes and Distance-Optimal Codes in the Sum-Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codes in the sum-rank metric have received many attentions in recent years, since they have wide applications in the multishot network coding, the space-time coding and the distributed storage. In this paper, by constructing covering codes in the sum-rank metric from covering codes in the Hamming metric, we derive new upper bounds on sizes, the covering radii and the block length functions of codes in the sum-rank metric. As applications, we present several strong Singleton-like bounds that are tighter than the classical Singleton-like bound when block lengths are large. In addition, we give the explicit constructions of the distance-optimal sum-rank codes of matrix sizes $s\times s$ and $2\times 2$ with minimum sum-rank distance four respectively by using cyclic codes in the Hamming metric. More importantly, we present an infinite families of quasi-perfect $q$-ary sum-rank codes with matrix sizes $2\times m$. Furthermore, we construct almost MSRD codes with larger block lengths and demonstrate how the Plotkin sum can be used to give more distance-optimal sum-rank codes.</description>

      <title>Multiset Deletion-Correcting Codes: Bounds and Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study error-correcting codes in the space $\mathcal{S}_{n,q}$ of length-$n$ multisets over a $q$-ary alphabet, motivated by permutation channels in which ordering is completely lost and errors act solely by deletions of symbols, i.e., by reducing symbol multiplicities.
  Our focus is on the \emph{extremal deletion regime}, where the channel output contains $k=n-t$ symbols. In this regime, we establish tight or near-tight bounds on the maximum code size. In particular, we determine the exact optimal code sizes for $t=n-1$ and for $t=n-2$, develop a refined analysis for $t=n-3$, and derive a general recursive puncturing upper bound for $t=n-k$ via a reduction from parameters $(n,k)$ to $(n-1,k-1)$.
  On the constructive side, we completely resolve the binary multiset model: for all $t\ge1$ we determine $S_2(n,t)$ exactly and give an explicit optimal congruence-based construction. We then study single-deletion codes beyond the binary case, presenting general $q$-ary constructions and showing, via explicit small-parameter examples, that the natural modular construction need not be optimal for $q\ge3$. Finally, we present an explicit cyclic Sidon-type linear construction for general $(q,t)$ based on a single congruence constraint, with redundancy $\log_q\!\bigl(t(t+1)^{q-2}+1\bigr)$ and encoding and decoding complexity linear in the blocklength $n$.</description>

      <title>Coset Shaping for Coded Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new shaping technique called coset shaping for coded QAM and PAM signaling is introduced and analyzed. This technique can be applied not only to information bits but also to parity bits without incurring additional complexity costs. It is proven that as the length of the error-correcting code and the modulation order tend to infinity, the gap to capacity for the proposed shaping scheme can be made arbitrarily small. Numerical results and comparisons for the shaping scheme, along with nonbinary LDPC-coded QAM signaling, are presented.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Electromagnetic Far-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems are envisioned to employ antenna architectures that not only transmit and receive electromagnetic (EM) waves, but also intentionally reflect and possibly transform incident EM waves. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in Maxwell's equations for analyzing the complexity of EM far-field modeling of general antenna architectures. We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Secure Multiuser Beamforming With Movable Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Universal and Asymptotically Optimal Data and Task Allocation in Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint minimization of communication and computation costs in distributed computing, where a master node coordinates $N$ workers to evaluate a function over a library of $n$ files. Assuming that the function is decomposed into an arbitrary subfunction set $\mathbf{X}$, with each subfunction depending on $d$ input files, renders our distributed computing problem into a $d$-uniform hypergraph edge partitioning problem wherein the edge set (subfunction set), defined by $d$-wise dependencies between vertices (files) must be partitioned across $N$ disjoint groups (workers). The aim is to design a file and subfunction allocation, corresponding to a partition of $\mathbf{X}$, that minimizes the communication cost $\pi_{\mathbf{X}}$, representing the maximum number of distinct files per server, while also minimizing the computation cost $\delta_{\mathbf{X}}$ corresponding to a maximal worker subfunction load. For a broad range of parameters, we propose a deterministic allocation solution, the \emph{Interweaved-Cliques (IC) design}, whose information-theoretic-inspired interweaved clique structure simultaneously achieves order-optimal communication and computation costs, for a large class of decompositions $\mathbf{X}$. This optimality is derived from our achievability and converse bounds, which reveal -- under reasonable assumptions on the density of $\mathbf{X}$ -- that the optimal scaling of the communication cost takes the form $n/N^{1/d}$, revealing that our design achieves the order-optimal \textit{partitioning gain} that scales as $N^{1/d}$, while also achieving an order-optimal computation cost. Interestingly, this order optimality is achieved in a deterministic manner, and very importantly, it is achieved blindly from $\mathbf{X}$, therefore enabling multiple desired functions to be computed without reshuffling files.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip With Cellular Drone Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a cellular network containing $n$ nodes where nodes within a cell gossip with each other in a fully-connected fashion and a source shares updates with these nodes via a mobile drone. The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $\lambda_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $\lambda_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $\lambda_d(n)$, but not on $\lambda_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $\lambda_d(n) \gg \lambda_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_m(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_d(n)$. If $\lambda_m(n) \gg \lambda_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_d(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_m(n)$.</description>

      <title>GlyRAG: Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Blood Glucose Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of blood glucose from CGM is essential for preventing dysglycemic events, thus enabling proactive diabetes management. However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.</description>

      <title>Detecting Planted Structure in Circular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing problems for circular data are formulated, where observations take values on the unit circle and may contain a hidden, phase-coherent structure. Under the null, the data are independent uniform on the unit circle; under the alternative, either (i) a planted subset of size K concentrates around an unknown phase (the flat setting), or (ii) a planted community of size k induces coherence among the edges of a complete graph (the community setting). In each of the two settings, two circular signal distributions are considered: a hard-cluster distribution, where correlated planted observations lie in an arc of known length and unknown location, and a von Mises distribution, where correlated planted observations follow a von Mises distribution with a common unknown location parameter. For each of the four resulting models, nearly matching necessary and sufficient conditions are derived (up to constants and occasional logarithmic factors) for detectability, thereby establishing information-theoretic phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of releasing the sample mean of bounded samples in a dataset, privately, under user-level $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). We aim to derive the optimal method of preprocessing data samples, within a canonical class of processing strategies, in terms of the error in estimation. Typical error analyses of such \emph{bounding} (or \emph{clipping}) strategies in the literature assume that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and sometimes also that all users contribute the same number of samples (data homogeneity) -- assumptions that do not accurately model real-world data distributions. Our main result in this work is a precise characterization of the preprocessing strategy that gives rise to the smallest \emph{worst-case} error over all datasets -- a \emph{distribution-independent} error metric -- while allowing for data heterogeneity. We also show via experimental studies that even for i.i.d. real-valued samples, our clipping strategy performs much better, in terms of \emph{average-case} error, than the widely used bounding strategy of Amin et al. (2019).</description>

      <title>Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>

      <title>The Voronoi Spherical CDF for Lattices and Linear Codes: New Bounds for Quantization and Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are valid for any finite dimension and are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound. They immediately translate to new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as new non-asymptotic upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel. In particular, we show that for most lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$ the second moment is greater than that of a Euclidean ball with the same covolume only by a $\left(1+O(\frac{1}{n})\right)$ multiplicative factor. Similarly, for most linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ the expected Hamming distortion is greater than that of a corresponding Hamming ball only by an additive universal constant.</description>

      <title>Linear time encodable binary code achieving GV bound with linear time encodable dual achieving GV bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of what we term ``fast good codes'' with ``fast good duals.'' Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a rate 1/2 binary linear code such that both it and its dual are asymptotically good (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are encodable in linear time. While we believe such codes should find applications more broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure computation task of encrypted matrix-vector product.
  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast good dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA) code. To create the rate 1/2 code, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps -- where first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the prefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative steps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these two operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code is very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.
  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA: we bound the expected number of codewords of weight below the GV bound. We face new challenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative operation (which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by careful case analysis.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Information Theory for Graph Edge Grouping and Substructure Analysis</title>

Abstract: Understanding natural phenomenon through the interactions of different complex systems has become an increasing focus in scientific inquiry. Defining complexity and actually measuring it is an ongoing debate and no standard framework has been established that is both theoretically sound and computationally practical to use. Currently, one of the fields which attempts to formally define complexity is in the realm of Algorithmic Information Theory. The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution. This analysis has been done in order to ascertain if Algorithmic Information Theory can be a viable theory in understanding substructures within graphs and ultimately as a foundation to create frameworks of measuring and analyzing complexity.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the goal is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. This allows us optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Normalized Conditional Mutual Information Surrogate Loss for Deep Neural Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel information theoretic surrogate loss; normalized conditional mutual information (NCMI); as a drop in alternative to the de facto cross-entropy (CE) for training deep neural network (DNN) based classifiers. We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline. Gains are consistent across various architectures and batch sizes, suggesting that NCMI is a practical and competitive alternative to CE.</description>
