      <title>Bayesian optimal design accelerates discovery of material properties from bubble dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal sequential experimental design approach is developed to characterize soft material properties at the high strain rates associated with bubble cavitation. The approach involves optimal design and model inference. The optimal design strategy maximizes the expected information gain in a Bayesian statistical setting to design experiments that provide the most informative cavitation data about unknown material properties. We infer constitutive models by characterizing the associated viscoelastic properties from measurements via a hybrid ensemble-based 4D-Var method (En4D-Var). The inertial microcavitation-based high strain-rate rheometry (IMR) method (Estrada et al. 2018) is used to simulate the bubble dynamics under laser-induced cavitation. Two sets of constitutive models demonstrate the method. We generate synthetic experimental data representing the viscoelastic behavior of stiff and soft polyacrylamide hydrogels. Accurate and efficient characterizations of the underlying models are presented.</description>

      <title>Droplets sliding on soft solids shed elastocapillary rails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface tension of partially wetting droplets deforms soft substrates. These deformations are usually localized to a narrow region near the contact line, forming a so-called `elastocapillary ridge.' When a droplet slides along a substrate, the movement of the elastocapillary ridge dissipates energy in the substrate and slows the droplet down. Previous studies have analyzed isotropically spreading droplets and found that the advancing contact line `surfs' the elastocapillary ridge, with a velocity determined by a local balance of capillary forces and bulk rheology. Here, we experimentally explore the dynamics of a droplet sliding across soft substrates. At low velocities, the contact line is nearly circular, and dissipation increases logarithmically with speed. At higher droplet velocities, the contact line adopts a bullet-like shape, and the dissipation levels off. At the same time, droplets shed a pair of `elastocapillary rails' that fade away slowly behind it. These results suggest that droplets favor sliding along a stationary ridge over surfing atop a translating one.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation in double-well potential. We observe the self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering in an asymmetric potential trap. By MD simulations, we obtain a phase diagram of flocking with active reorientation and potential asymmetry as parameters. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential. It shows that active reorientation of particles amplifies the degree of aggregation on one side in the asymmetric potential well. Furthermore, we calculate the mean squared displacement and identify distinct diffusion regimes. These results highlight active particles with active reorientation exhibit greater sensitivity in double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>The nature of water interactions and the molecular signatures of hydrophilicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar structuring of liquid water stems from a fine-tuned molecular principle embodying the two different interaction demands of the water molecule: The formation of hydrogen bonds or the compensation for coordination defects. Here we shall show that the same underlying molecular mechanism is also at play in order to establish favorable interactions with other systems. In this regard, the emergence of two limiting behaviors for hydrophilicity will help both to unravel its molecular underpinnings and to establish absolute values for such property.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic frictional behavior in the lubricated sliding of soft patterned surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lubricated contact of sliding soft surfaces that are locally patterned but globally cylindrical, held together under an external normal force. The local patterns represent either naturally occurring surface roughness or engineered surface textures. Three dimensionless parameters govern the system: a speed, and the amplitude and wavelength of the pattern. Using numerical solutions of the Reynolds lubrication equation, we investigate the effects of these dimensionless parameters on key variables such as contact pressure and the coefficient of friction of the lubricated system. For small roughness amplitudes, the coefficient of friction increases with roughness. However, our findings reveal that increasing surface roughness beyond a critical value can decrease the friction coefficient, a result that contradicts conventional intuition and classical studies on the lubrication of rigid surfaces. For very large roughness amplitudes, we show that the coefficient of friction drops even below the corresponding smooth case. We support these observations with a combination of perturbation theory and physical arguments, identifying scaling laws for large and small speeds, and for large and small roughness amplitudes. This study provides a quantitative understanding of friction in the contact of soft, wet objects and lays theoretical foundations for incorporating the friction coefficient into haptic feedback systems in soft robotics and haptic engineering.</description>

      <title>Tunable glassy dynamics in models of dense cellular tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of glassy dynamics in experiments on confluent cellular tissue have inspired a wealth of computational and theoretical research to model their emergent collective behavior. Initial studies of the physical properties of several geometric cell models, including vertex-type models, have highlighted anomalous sub-Arrhenius, or "ultra-strong," scaling of the dynamics with temperature. Here we show that the dynamics and material properties of the 2d Voronoi model deviate even further from the standard glassforming paradigm. By varying the characteristic shape index $p_0$, we demonstrate that the system properties can be tuned between displaying expected glassforming behavior, including the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland relation and the formation of dynamical heterogeneities, and an unusual regime in which the viscosity does not diverge as the characteristic relaxation time increase and dynamical heterogeneities are strongly suppressed. Our results provide further insight into the fundamental properties of this class of anomalous glassy materials, and provide a step towards designing materials with predetermined glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rotationally invariant local bond order parameters for accurate determination of hydrate structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Averaged local bond order parameters based on spherical harmonics, also known as Lechner and Dellago order parameters, are routinely used to determine crystal structures in molecular simulations. Among different options, the combination of the $\overline{q}_{4}$ and $\overline{q}_{6}$ parameters is one of the best choices in the literature since allows one to distinguish, not only between solid- and liquid-like particles but also between different crystallographic phases, including cubic and hexagonal phases. Recently, Algaba et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 623, 354, (2022)] have used the Lechner and Dellago order parameters to distinguish hydrate- and liquid-like water molecules in the context of determining the carbon dioxide hydrate-water interfacial free energy. According to the results, the preferred combination previously mentioned is not the best option to differentiate between hydrate- and liquid-like water molecules. In this work, we revisit and extend the use of these parameters to deal with systems in which clathrate hydrates phases coexist with liquid phases of water. We consider carbon dioxide, methane, tetrahydrofuran, nitrogen, and hydrogen hydrates that exhibit sI and sII crystallographic structures. We find that the $\overline{q}_{3}$ and $\overline{q}_{12}$ combination is the best option possible between a large number of possible different pairs to distinguish between hydrate- and liquid-like water molecules in all cases.</description>

      <title>Transient contacts between filaments impart its elasticity to branched actin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branched actin networks exert pushing forces in eukaryotic cells, and adapt their stiffness to their environment. The physical basis for their mechanics and adaptability is however not understood. Indeed, here we show that their high density and low connectivity place them outside the scope of standard elastic network models for actin. We combine high-precision mechanical experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and a mean-field elastic theory to show that they are instead dominated by the proliferation of interfilament contacts under compression. This places branched actin in the same category as undercoordinated, fibrous materials such as sheep's wool. When the network is grown under force, filaments entangle as if knitted together and trap contacts in their structure. Trapped contacts play a similar role as crosslinkers in rigidifying the network, and are thus key to its active adaptive mechanics.</description>

      <title>DNA transport is topologically sculpted by active microtubule dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of macromolecules, such as DNA, through the cytoskeleton is critical to wide-ranging cellular processes from cytoplasmic streaming to transcription. The rigidity and steric hindrances imparted by the network of filaments comprising the cytoskeleton often leads to anomalous subdiffusion, while active processes such as motor-driven restructuring can induce athermal superdiffusion. Understanding the interplay between these seemingly antagonistic contributions to intracellular dynamics remains a grand challenge. Here, we use single-molecule tracking to show that the transport of large linear and circular DNA through motor-driven microtubule networks can be non-gaussian and multi-modal, with the degree and spatiotemporal scales over which these features manifest depending non-trivially on the state of activity and DNA topology. For example, active network restructuring increases caging and non-Gaussian transport modes of linear DNA, while dampening these mechanisms for rings. We further discover that circular DNA molecules exhibit either markedly enhanced subdiffusion or superdiffusion compared to their linear counterparts, in the absence or presence of kinesin activity, indicative of microtubules threading circular DNA. This strong coupling leads to both stalling and directed transport, providing a direct route towards parsing distinct contributions to transport and determining the impact of coupling on the transport signatures. More generally, leveraging macromolecular topology as a route to programming molecular interactions and transport dynamics is an elegant yet largely overlooked mechanism that cells may exploit for intracellular trafficking, streaming, and compartmentalization. This mechanism could be harnessed for the design of self-regulating, sensing, and reconfigurable biomimetic matter.</description>

      <title>Control of Buckling of Colloidal Supraparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clusters of colloidal particles, often termed supraparticles, can provide more functionality than the individual particles they consist of. Since these functionalities are determined by the arrangement of the primary particles within a supraparticle, controlling the structure formation process is of fundamental importance. Here, we show how buckling is determined by particle-surfactant interactions and how the final morphology of the formed supraparticles can be controlled by manipulating these interactions in time. We use water/oil emulsions to template supraparticle formation and tailor the interactions of negatively charged colloidal particles with the surfactants stabilizing the water/oil-interface via the local pH within the aqueous droplet. At low pH, protonation of the anionic headgroup of the surfactant decreases electrostatic repulsion of the particles, facilitates interfacial adsorption, and subsequently causes buckling. We show that the local pH of the aqueous phase continuously changes during the assembly process. We gain control over the formation pathway by determining the point in time when interfacial adsorption is enabled, which we control via the initial pH. As a consequence, the final supraparticle morphology can be tailored at will, from fully buckled structures, via undulated surface morphologies to spherically rough and spherically smooth supraparticles and crystalline colloidal clusters.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measurements of non-equilibrium interactions of catalytic microswimmers with dual colloidal tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catalytic microswimmers convert the chemical energy of a fuel into motion, sustaining spatial chemical gradients and fluid flows that drive their propulsion. This leads to unconventional individual behavior and the emergence of collective dynamics, absent in equilibrium. The characterization of the nonequilibrium interactions driven by those concentration gradients and flows around microswimmers is challenging owing to the importance of fluctuations at the microscale. Previous experiments have focused on large Janus microspheres attached to a surface, and did not investigate non-equilibrium interactions for freely moving microswimmers of various shapes. Here we show a massive dependence of the non-equilibrium interactions on the shape of small catalytic microswimmers. We perform tracking experiments at high troughput to map non-equilibrium interactions between swimmers and colloidal tracers in 2D, accurate down to tracer velocity of 100nm/s. In addition, we devise a novel experimental method combining two types of tracers with differing phoretic mobility to disentangle phoretic interactions in concentration gradients from hydrodynamic flows. We benchmark the method with experiments on a single chemically active site and on a catalytic microswimmer tethered to a surface. We further investigate the activity-driven interactions of freely moving catalytic dimers as microswimmers, for a wide range of aspect ratio between the active and passive part. We confront our results with standard theoretical models of microswimmers near surfaces and show poor agreement, ruling out phoresis as the main interaction for catalytic swimmers. Our findings provide robust quantitative measurements of the non-equilibrium interactions of catalytic microswimmers of various geometry with their environment. The work notably indicates the need for theoretical development, and lays the groundwork for the quantitative description of collective behavior in suspensions of phoretically-driven colloidal suspensions.</description>

      <title>Compression Causes Expansion and Compaction of the Jammed Polydisperse Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focused on the expansion in polydisperse granular materials owing to mechanical annealing, which involved compression and decompression. Following minor annealing, the polydisperse systems exhibited compaction as well as the systems having uniform-sized particles. However, following extensive annealing, only the polydisperse systems were observed to expand. Pressure history and structure analysis indicated that this expansion results from the size segregation of the particles. We attribute this segregation to particle-size-dependent effective attraction. The results of this study highlight the strong history dependence of the packing fraction and structure in polydisperse particles and reveal a potential-energy-driven segregation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Conformation and topology of cyclical star polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformation and topological properties of cyclical star polymers with $f$ ring arms, each made of $n$ beads. We find that the conformational properties of unlinked cyclical star polymers are compatible to those of linear star polymers with $2f$ arms made of $n/2$ beads each. This compatibility vanishes when the topology of the star, measured as the degree of linking between arms, changes. In fact, when links are allowed we notice that the gyration radius decreases as a function of the absolute linking number $\vert Lk \vert$ of the arms, regardless of the protocol that is employed to introduce said links. Furthermore, the internal structure of the macromolecules, as highlighted by the radial density function, changes qualitatively for large values of $\vert Lk \vert$.</description>

      <title>COLIS: an advanced light scattering apparatus for investigating the structure and dynamics of soft matter onboard the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal Solids (COLIS) is a state-of-the-art light scattering setup developed for experiments onboard the International Space Station (ISS). COLIS allows for probing the structure and dynamics of soft matter systems on a wide range of length scales, from a few nm to tens of microns, and on time scales from 100 ns to tens of hours. In addition to conventional static and dynamic light scattering, COLIS includes depolarized dynamic light scattering, a small-angle camera, photon correlation imaging, and optical manipulation of thermosensitive samples through an auxiliary near-infrared laser beam, thereby providing a unique platform for probing soft matter systems. We demonstrate COLIS through ground tests on standard Brownian suspensions, and on protein, colloidal glasses, and gel systems similar to those to be used in future ISS experiments.</description>

      <title>Rheological regimes in agitated granular media under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agitated granular media have a rich rheology: they exhibit Newtonian behavior at low shear rate and density, develop a yield stress at high density, and cross over to Bagnoldian shear thickening when sheared rapidly -- making them challenging to encompass in one theoretical framework. We measure the rheology of air-fluidized glass particles, spanning five orders of magnitude in shear rate, and show that all rheological regimes can be delineated by two dimensionless numbers. We propose a constitutive relation that captures all flow behaviors, qualitatively and quantitatively, in one unified framework.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dielectric Relaxation in Semicrystalline Polymers -- Understanding the Role of the Interphase between the Amorphous and Crystalline Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semicrystalline polymers (SCP) represent important class of materials used in many applications from packaging to transportation to electronics to pharmaceuticals. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the crystalline and amorphous fractions within SCP is an important challenge for both experimentalists and theoreticians. Recently, Cheng et al. (S. Cheng et al., J. Chem. Phys. 160, 114904 (2024)) utilized Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) to explore the relaxation time profiles within the amorphous region of a semi-crystalline poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with ordered alternative stacking of crystalline/amorphous phases. Here, we build on those initial results and model the relaxation time distribution using the combination of the Doolittle free volume theory (FVT) and the compressible Self-Consistent Field Theory (cSCFT). We show that the new modeling framework successfully captures the temperature and position dependence of the local relaxation time of the semicrystalline PLLA above the glass transition temperature of the amorphous region. Finally, we derive a new empirical equation for the relaxation time profiles in amorphous regions of SCPs.</description>

      <title>A novel 3D food printing technique: achieving tunable porosity and fracture properties via liquid rope coiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D food printing (3DFP) method to create coiled structures, harnessing the liquid rope coiling effect as a rapid method of food printing with tunable fractural properties. By studying the printability and coil-forming ability of pea, carrot, and cookie dough inks, we identified optimal printing parameters to induce steady and controlled coiling, enabling the creation of coiled structures with tunable porosities using a single nozzle. Fracture profiles from post-processed coiled structures showed complex responses but presented direct correlations between the porosity and textural parameters, including hardness, brittleness, and initial stiffness. This study provides a foundation for the fabrication of coiled food structures using 3DFP and highlights its potential application in designing textural properties and a range of unique sensory experiences.</description>

      <title>Double-network-inspired mechanical metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are renowned for their ability to achieve high stiffness and strength at low densities, often at the expense of low ductility and stretchability-a persistent trade-off in materials. In contrast, materials such as double-network hydrogels feature interpenetrating compliant and stiff polymer networks, and exhibit unprecedented combinations of high stiffness and stretchability, resulting in exceptional toughness. Here, we present double-network-inspired (DNI) metamaterials by integrating monolithic truss (stiff) and woven (compliant) components into a metamaterial architecture, which achieve a tenfold increase in stiffness and stretchability compared to their pure woven and truss counterparts, respectively. Nonlinear computational mechanics models elucidate that enhanced energy dissipation in these DNI metamaterials stems from increased frictional dissipation due to entanglements between the two networks. Through introduction of internal defects, which typically degrade mechanical properties, we demonstrate an opposite effect of a threefold increase in energy dissipation for these metamaterials via failure delocalization. This work opens avenues for developing new classes of metamaterials in a high-compliance regime inspired by polymer network topologies.</description>

      <title>Solute-mediated colloidal vortex in a microfluidic T-junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solute gradients next to an interface drive a diffusioosmotic flow, the origin of which lies in the intermolecular interactions between the solute and the interface. These flows on the surface of colloids introduce an effective slip velocity, driving their diffusiophoretic migration. In confined environments, we expect the interplay between diffusiophoretic migration and diffusioosmotic flows near the walls to govern the motion of colloids. These near-wall osmotic flows are, however, often considered weak and neglected. Here, using microfluidic experiments in a T-junction, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling, we show that the interplay between osmotic and phoretic effects leads to unexpected outcomes: forming a colloidal vortex in the absence of inertial effects, and demixing and focusing of the colloids in the direction opposite to what is commonly expected from diffusiophoresis alone. We show these colloidal vortices to be persistent for a range of salt types, salt gradients, and flow rates, and establish a criterion for their emergence. Our work sheds light on how boundaries modulate the solute-mediated transport of colloids in confined environments.</description>

      <title>Using test particle sum rules to construct accurate functionals in classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) is a successful and versatile approach for describing the properties of the hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures within the framework of classical density functional theory (DFT). Lutsko [Phys. Rev. E 102, 062137 (2020)] introduced a version of FMT containing two free parameters, to be fixed by additional physical constraints. Whereas Lutsko focused on the stability of crystalline phases, we introduce and employ two statistical mechanical sum rules pertinent for the fluid phase, that are not automatically satisfied by FMT. By minimizing the relative deviation between different routes to calculate the excess chemical potential and the isothermal compressibility we determine the two free parameters of the theory. Our results indicate that requiring consistency with these sum rules can improve the quality of predictions of FMT for properties of the hard-sphere fluid phase. We suggest that employing these (test particle) sum rules, which apply for any interparticle pair-potential, might provide a means of testing the performance and accuracy of general DFT approximations.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of smoothly dividing disk-shaped cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Replication through cell division is one of the most fundamental processes of life and a major driver of dynamics in systems ranging from bacterial colonies to embryogenesis, tissues and tumors. While regulation often plays a role in shaping self-organization, mounting evidence suggests that many biologically relevant behaviors exploit principles based on a limited number of physical ingredients, and particle-based models have become a popular platform to reconstitute and investigate these emergent dynamics. However, incorporating division into such models often leads to aberrant mechanical fluctuations that hamper physically meaningful analysis. Here, we present a minimal model focusing on mechanical consistency during division. Cells are comprised of two nodes, overlapping disks which separate from each other during cell division, resulting in transient dumbbell shapes. Internal degrees of freedom, cell-cell interactions and equations of motion are designed to ensure force continuity at all times, including through division, both for the dividing cell itself as well as interaction partners, while retaining the freedom to define arbitrary anisotropic mobilities. As a benchmark, we also translate an established model of proliferating spherocylinders with similar dynamics into our theoretical framework. Numerical simulations of both models demonstrate force continuity of the new disk cell model and quantify our improvements. We also investigate some basic collective behaviors related to alignment and orientational order and find consistency both between the models and with the literature. A reference implementation of the model is freely available as a package in the Julia programming language based on $\textit{InPartS.jl}$. Our model is ideally suited for the investigation of mechanical observables such as velocities and stresses, and is easily extensible with additional features.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Prediction of Protein-Polyelectrolyte Binding Thermodynamics: Adsorption of Heparin-Analog Polysulfates to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions of polyelectrolytes (PEs) with proteins play a crucial role in numerous biological processes, such as the internalization of virus particles into host cells. Although docking, machine learning methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are utilized to estimate binding poses and binding free energies of small-molecule drugs to proteins, quantitative prediction of the binding thermodynamics of PE-based drugs presents a significant obstacle in computer-aided drug design. This is due to the sluggish dynamics of PEs caused by their size and strong charge-charge correlations. In this paper, we introduce advanced sampling methods based on a force-spectroscopy setup and theoretical modeling to overcome this barrier. We exemplify our method with explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations of interactions of anionic PEs that show antiviral properties, namely heparin and linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS), with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Our prediction for the binding free energy of LPGS to the wild-type RBD matches experimentally measured dissociation constants within thermal energy, kT, and correctly reproduces the experimental PE-length dependence. We find that LPGS binds to the Delta-variant RBD with an additional free-energy gain of 2.4 kT, compared to the wild-type RBD, in accord with electrostatic arguments. We show that the LPGS-RBD binding is solvent-dominated and enthalpy-driven, though with a large entropy-enthalpy compensation. Our method is applicable to general polymer adsorption phenomena and predicts precise binding free energies and re-configurational friction as needed for drug and drug-delivery design.</description>

      <title>Switchable Conformation in Protein Subunits: Unveiling Assembly Dynamics of Icosahedral Viruses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The packaging of genetic material within a protein shell, called the capsid, marks a pivotal step in the life cycle of numerous single-stranded RNA viruses. Understanding how hundreds, or even thousands, of proteins assemble around the genome to form highly symmetrical structures remains an unresolved puzzle. In this paper, we design novel subunits and develop a model that enables us to explore the assembly pathways and genome packaging mechanism of icosahedral viruses, which were previously inaccessible. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe capsid fragments, varying in protein number and morphology, assembling at different locations along the genome. Initially, these fragments create a disordered structure that later merges to form a perfect symmetric capsid. The model demonstrates remarkable strength in addressing numerous unresolved issues surrounding virus assembly. For instance, it enables us to explore the advantages of RNA packaging by capsid proteins over linear polymers. Our MD simulations are in excellent agreement with our experimental findings from small-angle X-ray scattering and cryo-transmission electron microscopy, carefully analyzing the assembly products of viral capsid proteins around RNAs with distinct topologies.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-object dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interaction among N parallel elongated objects such as DNA/RNA strands or metallic nanotubes, which are polarizable primarily along the long axis. Within a quasi-one-dimensional model, we prove that the irreducible N -object vdW energy contribution is negative (attractive) for even N and positive (repulsive) for odd N. We confirm these results up to $N=4$ via a 3-dimensional plasma cylinder model. This suggests a preference for even-N clustering of elongated structures in nanoscience and biology. This work could have implications e.g. for nanotube bundle formation and for the clustering of long-chain biomolecules at separations exceeding chemical bond lengths.</description>

      <title>Physical mechanism reveals bacterial slowdown above a critical number of flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have explored the link between bacterial swimming and the number of flagella, a distinguishing feature of motile multiflagellated bacteria. We revisit this open question using augmented slender-body theory simulations, in which we resolve the full hydrodynamic interactions within a bundle of helical filaments rotating and translating in synchrony. Unlike previous studies, our model considers the full torque-speed relationship of the bacterial flagellar motor, revealing its significant impact on multiflagellated swimming. Because the viscous load per motor decreases with flagellar number, the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) transitions from the high-load to the low-load regime at a critical number of filaments, leading to bacterial slowdown as further flagella are added to the bundle. We explain the physical mechanism behind the observed slowdown as an interplay between the load-dependent generation of torque by the motor, and the load-reducing cooperativity between flagella, which consists of both hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic components. The theoretically predicted critical number of flagella is remarkably close to the values reported for the model organism \textit{Escherichia coli}. Our model further predicts that the critical number of flagella increases with viscosity, suggesting that bacteria can enhance their swimming capacity by growing more flagella in more viscous environments, consistent with empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the period of the bubble formation and the size of bubbles as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we successfully identified in a clear manner that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in thin films whose thickness is determined by Derjaguin's law balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, demonstrating the potential of scaling analysis even in extremely complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the size of the bubble created: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role beyond the conventional mechanism of Tate in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advance our knowledge of bubble generation and bubble pinch-off in a clear manner with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a new avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characters of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

Abstract: Given a small spherical particle, we consider flow of a nematic liquid crystal in the corresponding exterior domain. Our focus is on precise far field asymptotic behavior of the flow in a parameter regime when the governing equations can be reduced to a system of linear partial differential equations. We are able to analytically characterize the velocity of the flow and compare it to the classical expression for the Stokes flow. The expression for velocity away from the particle can be computed either numerically or symbolically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An understanding of the disease spreading phenomenon based on a mathematical model is extremely needed for the implication of the correct policy measures to contain the disease propagation. Here, we report a new model namely the Ising-SIR model describing contagious disease spreading phenomena including both airborne and direct contact disease transformations. In the airborne case, a susceptible agent can catch the disease either from the environment or its infected neighbors whereas in the second case, the agent can be infected only through close contact with its infected neighbors. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice using periodic boundary conditions to investigate the dynamics of disease spread. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism of disease spreading plays a significant role in the growth dynamics and leads to different growth exponent. In the direct contact disease spreading mechanism, the growth exponent is nearly equal to two for some model parameters which agrees with earlier empirical observations. In addition, the model predicts various types of spatiotemporal patterns that can be observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. The shape of the equivalent effective particle is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in networks entails a dynamical transfer of information between stochastic variables. Transfer entropy is widely used for quantification of the directional transfer of information between input and output trajectories. However, currently there is no exact technique to quantify transfer entropy given the dynamical model of a general network. Here we introduce an exact computational algorithm, Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), to quantify transfer entropy and its variants in an arbitrary network in the presence of multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. TE-PWS extends a recently introduced algorithm Path Weight Sampling (PWS) and uses techniques from the statistical physics of polymers and trajectory sampling. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of data processing inequalities in presence of feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt statistical models of the physics of complex fluids to study the rheology of granular liquids. This allows us to provide laws of granular rheology based on first principles, which compare well with previously established phenomenological laws. In particular, the very successful law of mu(I) rheology can be understood within our model as the lowest order non trivial Pade approximant of the macroscopic laws of rheology. Our model's ability to describe granular physics outside of the Bagnold scaling regime allows for a natural extension to the rheology of granular suspensions.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity and odd viscosity in chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd viscosity couples stress to strain rate in a dissipationless way. It has been studied in plasmas under magnetic fields, superfluid ${\rm He}^3$, quantum-Hall fluids, and recently in the context of chiral active matter. In most of these studies, odd terms in the viscosity obey Onsager reciprocal relations. Although this is expected in equilibrium systems, it is not obvious that Onsager relations hold in active materials. By directly coarse graining the kinetic energy and independently using both the Poisson-bracket formalism and a kinetic theory derivation, we find that the appearance of a non-vanishing angular momentum density, which is a hallmark of chiral active materials, necessarily breaks Onsager reciprocal relations. This leads to a non-Hermitian dynamical matrix for the total hydrodynamic momentum and to the appearance of odd viscosity and other non-dissipative contributions to the viscosity. Furthermore, by accounting for both the angular momentum density and interactions that lead to odd viscosity, we find regions in the parameter space in which 3D odd mechanical waves propagate and regions in which they are mechanically unstable. The lines separating these regions are continuous lines of exceptional points, suggesting a possible non-reciprocal phase transition.</description>

      <title>Evolution of local relaxed states and the modelling of viscoelastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of continuum mechanical models aimed at describing the behaviour of viscoelastic fluids by incorporating concepts originated in the theory of solid plasticity. Within this class, even a simple model with constant material parameters is able to qualitatively reproduce a number of experimental observations in both simple shear and extensional flows, including linear viscoelastic properties, the rate dependence of steady-state material functions, the stress overshoot in incipient shear flows, and the difference in shear and extensional rheological curves. Furthermore, by allowing the relaxation time of the model to depend on the total strain, we can reproduce some experimental observations of the non-attainability of steady flows in uniaxial extension, and link this to a concept of polymeric jamming or effective solidification. Remarkably, this modelling framework helps in understanding the interplay between different mechanisms that may compete in determining the rheology of non-Newtonian materials.</description>

      <title>Trading particle shape with fluid symmetry: on the mobility matrix in 3D chiral fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral fluids - such as fluids under rotation or a magnetic field as well as synthetic and biological active fluids - flow in a different way than ordinary ones. Due to symmetries broken at the microscopic level, chiral fluids may have asymmetric stress and viscosity tensors, for example giving rise to a hydrostatic torque or non-dissipative (odd) and parity-violating viscosities. In this article, we investigate the motion of rigid bodies in such an anisotropic fluid in the incompressible Stokes regime through the mobility matrix, which encodes the response of a solid body to forces and torques. We demonstrate how the form of the mobility matrix, which is usually determined by particle geometry, can be analogously controlled by the symmetries of the fluid. By computing the mobility matrix for simple shapes in a three-dimensional anisotropic chiral fluid, we predict counter-intuitive phenomena such as motion perpendicular to applied forces and spinning under the force of gravity.</description>

      <title>Theory of Wetting Dynamics with Surface Binding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecules, such as proteins and RNAs, can phase separate in the cytoplasm of cells to form biomolecular condensates. Such condensates are liquid-like droplets that can wet biological surfaces such as membranes. Many molecules that participate in phase separation can also reversibly bind to membrane surfaces. When a droplet wets a surface, molecules can diffuse inside and outside of the droplet or in the bound state on the surface. How the interplay between surface binding, diffusion in surface and bulk affects the wetting kinetics is not well understood. Here, we derive the governing equations using non-equilibrium thermodynamics by relating the thermodynamic fluxes and forces at the surface coupled to the bulk. We study the spreading dynamics in the presence of surface binding and find that binding speeds up wetting by nucleating a droplet inside the surface. Our results suggest that the wetting dynamics of droplets can be regulated by two-dimensional surface droplets in the surface-bound layer through changing the binding affinity to the surfaces. These findings are relevant both to engineering life-like systems with condensates and vesicles, and biomolecular condensates in living cells.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to overheat ice? The activated melting of TIP4P/Ice at solid-vapor coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1 K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>Lorentz transformation for the kinematics of degree-4 rigid origami vertices and compatibility of rigid-foldable polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer new insight into the folding kinematics of degree-4 rigid origami vertices by drawing an analogy to spacetime in special relativity. Specifically, folded states of the vertex, described by pairs of fold angles in terms of cotangent of half-angles, are related through Lorentz transformations in $1+1$ dimensions. Linear ordinary differential equations are derived for the tangent vectors on two-dimensional fold-angle planes, with the coefficient matrix depending exclusively on the sector angles. By taking the limit to the flat state, we generalize the fold-angle multipliers previously defined for flat-foldable vertices to general and collinear developable degree-4 vertices, and obtain a compatibility theorem on the rigid-foldability of polygons with $n$ developable degree-4 vertices. We further explore the rigid-foldable polygons of equimodular type and compose tangent vectors involving fold angles at the creases of the central polygon.</description>

Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics systems to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

Abstract: Through the decomposition of the pressure into the kinetic and the intermolecular contributions, we show that the pressure anisotropy in the fluid interface, which is the source of the interfacial tension, comes solely from the latter contribution. The pressure anisotropy due to the intermolecular force between the fluid particles in the same or the different fluid components is approximately proportional to the multiplication of the corresponding fluid density gradients, and from the molecular dynamics simulation of the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces, we demonstrate that the density gradient theory (DGT) by van der Waals gives the leading order approximation of the free energy density in inhomogeneous systems, neglecting the Tolman length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The driving forces of chiral active particles and deformations of cells are often modeled by spatially inhomogeneous but temporally periodic driving forces. Such inhomogeneous oscillatory driving forces have only recently been proposed in the context of active matter, and their effects on the systems are not yet fully understood. In this work, we theoretically study the impact of spatially inhomogeneous oscillatory driving forces on continuous symmetry breaking. We first analyze the linear model for the soft modes in the ordered phase to derive the lower critical dimension of the model, and then analyze the spherical model to investigate more detailed phase behaviors. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that symmetry breaking occurs even in one and two dimensions, where the Hohenberg--Mermin--Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking in equilibrium. Furthermore, fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as density, are anomalously suppressed in the long-wavelength, {\it i.e.}, show hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity --the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.</description>

      <title>The role of viscosity on drop impact forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a rigid substrate undergoes deformation and spreading due to normal reaction forces, which are counteracted by surface tension. On a non-wetting substrate, the drop subsequently retracts and takes off. Our recent work (Zhang et al., \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, vol. 129, 2022, 104501) revealed two peaks in the temporal evolution of the normal force $F(t)$ -- one at impact and another at jump-off. The second peak coincides with a Worthington jet formation, which vanishes at high viscosities due to increased viscous dissipation affecting flow focusing. In this article, using experiments, direct numerical simulations, and scaling arguments, we characterize both the peak amplitude $F_1$ at impact and the one at take off ($F_2$) and elucidate their dependency on the control parameters: the Weber number $We$ (dimensionless impact kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity). The first peak amplitude $F_1$ and the time $t_1$ to reach it depend on inertial timescales for low viscosity liquids, remaining nearly constant for viscosities up to 100 times that of water. For high viscosity liquids, we balance the rate of change in kinetic energy with viscous dissipation to obtain new scaling laws: $F_1/F_\rho \sim \sqrt{Oh}$ and $t_1/\tau_\rho \sim 1/\sqrt{Oh}$, where $F_\rho$ and $\tau_\rho$ are the inertial force and time scales, respectively, which are consistent with our data. The time $t_2$ at which the amplitude $F_2$ appears is set by the inertio-capillary timescale $\tau_\gamma$, independent of both the viscosity and the impact velocity of the drop. However, these properties dictate the magnitude of this amplitude.</description>

      <title>The non-reciprocal Ising model</title>

Abstract: Systems with non-reciprocal interactions generically display time-dependent states. These are routinely observed in finite systems, from neuroscience to active matter, in which globally ordered oscillations exist. However, the stability of these uniform non-reciprocal phases in noisy spatially-extended systems, their fate in the thermodynamic limit, and the criticality of the corresponding phase transitions are not fully understood. Here, we address these questions by introducing a non-reciprocal generalization of the Ising model and study its critical behavior by means of numerical and analytical approaches. While the mean-field equations predict three stable homogeneous phases (disordered, ordered and a time-dependent swap phase), our large scale numerical simulations reveal a more complex picture. Static order is destroyed in any finite dimension due to the growth of rare droplets unless the symmetry between the two spins types is broken triggering a stabilizing droplet-capture mechanism. The swap phase is destroyed by fluctuations in two dimensions through the proliferation of spiral defects, but stabilized in three dimensions where non-reciprocity changes the critical exponents from Ising to XY, thus giving rise to a robust spatially-distributed clock.</description>

      <title>Entropic pulling and diffusion diode in an It\^o process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential (and, equivalently an entropy) that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. This emergent force when looked at as of entropic origin it provides a physical basis of the notion of the entropic pulling postulated in the context of working of some biological systems.</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>
