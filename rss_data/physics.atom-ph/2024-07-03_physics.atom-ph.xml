      <title>Radiative decay of muonic molecules in resonance states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we theoretically investigated x-ray spectra from the radiative decay of muonic deuterium molecules dd$\mu$ in resonance states which plays an important role in a new kinetic model of muon catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF). The resonance states are Feshbach resonances located below the d$\mu$($n=2$) + d threshold energy and radiatively decay into the continuum or bound states. The x-ray spectra having characteristic shapes according to the radial distribution of the two nuclei are obtained using precise three-body wave functions. We carefully examined the convergence of the x-ray spectra and achieved agreements between the length- and velocity-gauge calculations. We revealed a non-adiabatic kinetic energy distribution of the decay fragments, indicating that the radiative decay results in epithermal muonic atoms. We also investigated the decay branch directly resulting in bound-state muonic molecules. Some resonance states dd$\mu^\ast$ and dt$\mu^\ast$ are found to have high branching ratios to the bound state where intramolecular nuclear fusion occurs. The direct formation of the muonic molecules in the bound states from metastable muonic atoms can be a fast track in the $\mu$CF cycle which skips slow path to form the bound state from the ground-state muonic atoms and increases the $\mu$CF cycle rate. Although the spectra from the radiative decays are located in the energy range of $1.5$--$1.997$ keV, close to the K$\alpha$ x-ray of 1.997 keV from muonic hydrogen atoms, recently developed state-of-the-art microcalorimeters can distinguish them.</description>

      <title>Study of ion induced Inner Shell Ionization cross section through electron capture mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron Capture (EC) cross-section from K, L and M shells of the target atoms to the vacant K, L and M shells of the projectile ions have been calculated by deriving the accurate momentum transfer to the captured electrons for different charge states. Several correction factors like polarization correction, relativistic effects (R) of the target wave function, Coulomb-deflection factor (C) due to the effect of the repulsion between the projectile and the target nucleus, correction for projectile energy loss have been introduced. The mean charge state of the projectiles inside the target material has been estimated using suitable empirical models and the fractional charge state distribution has been calculated considering Lorentz distribution. Fractional distribution of charge state of the projectile ions is used to obtain the charge state contributions of the electron capture cross-sections. The effect of Simultaneous Multiple Ionization (SMI) has been considered in the theory of Direct Coulomb Ionization (DCI). The theoretically obtained total cross-sections have been compared with the experimental findings obtained from various literature. The computation scheme has been depicted through sample calculations of ionization cross-sections through electron capture mechanism.</description>

      <title>Effect of antiprotons on hydrogen-like ions in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, quasi-molecular compounds consisting of one antiproton ($\bar{p}$) and one hydrogen-like ion are investigated: $\mathrm{He}^{+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Li}^{2+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{C}^{5+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{S}^{15+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Kr}^{35+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Ho}^{66+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{Re}^{74+} - \bar{p}$, $\mathrm{U}^{91+} - \bar{p}$. For the calculations, the Dirac equation with two-center potential is solved numerically using the dual-kinetically balanced finite-basis-set method adapted to systems with axial symmetry (A-DKB). Adiabatic potential curves are constructed for the ground state of the above quasi-molecular compounds in the framework of the A-DKB approach. Calculations were also performed for the case of an external magnetic field (the field is taken into account non-perturbatively). Zeeman shifts of the quasi-molecular terms are obtained for a homogeneous magnetic field with a strength of the laboratory order (up to 100 Tesla) directed along the axis of the molecule.</description>

      <title>The role of the effective range in strongly-interacting few-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting systems appear in several areas of physics and are characterized by attractive interactions that can almost, or just barely, loosely bind two particles. Although this definition is made at the two-body level, this gives rise to fascinating effects in larger systems, including the so-called Efimov physics. In this context, the zero-range theory aims to describe low-energy properties based only on the scattering length. However, for a broad range of physical applications, the finite range of the interactions plays an important role. In this work, I discuss some aspects of finite-range effects in strongly interacting systems. I present the zero-range and shapeless universalities in two-body systems with applications in atomic and nuclear physics. I derived an analytical expression for the $s$-wave bound-state spectrum of the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential for two particles in three dimensions, which is compared with the approximations to illustrate their usefulness. Concerning three identical bosons, I presented a trimer energy scaling function that explicitly includes the effective range. The implications for larger systems are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Realization of a magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color dipole trap with sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval in positronium using field-ionization of Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new 40 ppb measurement of the positronium $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval using pulsed two-photon optical spectroscopy. The transition is detected via field-ionization of atoms excited from the 2S to the 20P Rydberg state. Precise Monte-Carlo line-shape simulations allow for the accounting of effects such as Doppler and AC Stark shifts, while an optical heterodyne measurement of the excitation laser pulse is used to correct for laser frequency chirp. A value of $1\,233\,607\,210.5\pm 49.6\, \mathrm{MHz}$ was obtained. This scheme allows for the measurement of the velocity distribution of positronium atoms to correct for the second-order Doppler effect. This is the major source of systematic uncertainty expected for future measurements of this transition with a CW laser, thus, our technique paves the way toward a new generation of a high precision determination of this interval in positronium.</description>

      <title>Plasma Induced Variation of Electron Capture and Bound-State $\beta$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slow neutron capture ($s$-process) synthesises ~50% of all elements in the universe heavier than iron, whose abundances are determined by the competition between neutron capture and nuclear $\beta$-decay rates. The latter are expected to vary inside hot and dense plasmas such as those found in $s$-process nucleosynthesis sites. Here, we present a new and general theoretical study of the effect of local and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium ((N)LTE) plasmas on $\beta$-decays, using orbital electron capture (EC) decays in $^{7}$Be as a model case. We begin from the model of Takahashi and Yokoi to calculate the lepton phase volume of $^{7}$Be as a function of its ionisation state and excitation level, and consequently, the configuration-dependent EC decay rate. We then calculate the in-plasma ion charge state distribution (CSD) and level population distribution (LPD) for a grid of plasma density and temperatures, using the population kinetics code FLYCHK. By combining the configuration-dependent EC rate with the CSD and LPD, we calculate the in-plasma orbital EC rate in $^{7}$Be. The results show a strong correlation between the half-life and thermodynamic conditions of the plasma, underlining the importance of measuring decay rates in laboratory plasmas and the relevance of high precision atomic configuration models. The model discussed in this work is capable of calculating EC and bound state $\beta$ decay (BSBD) rates in both low-density NLTE and high-density LTE plasmas. We conclude by validating our model with state-of-the-art data in literature on isotopes of Pr and Dy, and by proposing future extension of the model to laboratory magnetoplasmas and stellar interiors aimed at improving nucleosynthesis models.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rotational Cavity Optomechanics Using Atomic Superfluid in a Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid optomechanical system containing an annularly trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity driven by Lauguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes. Spiral phase elements serve as the end mirrors of the cavity such that the rear mirror oscillates torsionally about the cavity axis through a clamped support. As described earlier in a related system [P. Kumar et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 113601 (2021)], the condensate atoms interact with the optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum which create two atomic side modes. We observe three peaks in the output noise spectrum corresponding to the atomic side modes and rotating mirror frequencies, respectively. We find that the trapped BEC's rotation reduces quantum fluctuations at the mirror's resonance frequency. We also find that the atomic side modes-cavity coupling and the optorotational coupling can produce bipartite and tripartite entanglements between various constituents of our hybrid system. We reduce the frequency difference between the side modes and the mirror by tuning the drive field's topological charge and the condensate atoms' rotation. When the atomic side modes become degenerate with the mirror, the stationary entanglement between the cavity and the mirror mode diminishes due to the suppression of cooling. Our proposal, which combines atomic superfluid circulation with mechanical rotation, provides a versatile platform for reducing quantum fluctuations and producing macroscopic entanglement with experimentally realizable parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions in spin-based Hamiltonians are crucial in addressing numerous fundamentally significant physical problems. In this work, Rydberg-atom graph gadgets are introduced to effectively program $K$-th order interactions within a Rydberg atom system. This approach facilitates the determination of the ground states of an Ising-type Hamiltonian, encoded to solve higher-order unconstrained optimization problems. A favorable scaling behavior, $O(N^K)$, is expected in terms of the number of atoms required for $N$-vertex hypergraph optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Predicting correlations in superradiant emission from a cascaded quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent experiments, a novel type of cascaded quantum system has been realized using nanofiber-coupled cold atomic ensembles. This setup has enabled the study of superradiant decay of highly excited collective spin states of up to a thousand atoms, featuring unidirectional coupling mediated by the waveguide mode. The complexity arising from the large, multi-excited ensemble and the cascaded interactions between atoms makes conventional simulation methods unsuitable for predicting the correlations of superradiant emission beyond the first order. To address this challenge, we developed a new simulation technique based on the truncated Wigner approximation for spins. Our stochastic simulation tool can predict the second-order quantum coherence function, $g^{(2)}$, along with other correlators of the light field emitted by a strongly excited cascaded system of two-level emitters. This approach thus provides an effective and scalable method for analyzing cascaded quantum systems with large numbers of particles.</description>

      <title>Rapidly-rotating quantum droplets confined in a harmonic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a "symmetric" quantum droplet in two spatial dimensions, which rotates in a harmonic potential, focusing mostly on the limit of "rapid" rotation. We examine this problem using a purely numerical approach, as well as a semi-analytic Wigner-Seitz approximation (first developed by Baym, Pethick et al.) for the description of the state with a vortex lattice. Within this approximation we assume that each vortex occupies a cylindrical cell, with the vortex-core size treated as a variational parameter. Working with a fixed angular momentum, as the angular momentum increases and depending on the atom number, the droplet accommodates none, few, or many vortices, before it turns to center-of-mass excitation. For the case of a "large" droplet, working with a fixed rotational frequency of the trap $\Omega$, as $\Omega$ approaches the trap frequency $\omega$, a vortex lattice forms, the number of vortices increases, the mean spacing between them decreases, while the "size" of each vortex increases as compared to the size of each cell. In contrast to the well-known problem of contact interactions, where we have melting of the vortex lattice and highly-correlated many-body states, here no melting of the vortex lattice is present, even when $\Omega = \omega$. This difference is due to the fact that the droplet is self-bound. Actually, for $\Omega = \omega$, the "smoothed" density distribution becomes a flat top, very much like the static droplet. When $\Omega$ exceeds $\omega$, the droplet maintains its shape and escapes to infinity, via center-of-mass motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent polarization gradients in tight optical tweezers can be used to couple the atomic spins to the two-body motion under the action of a microwave spin-flip transition, so that such a spin-motion coupling offers an important control knob on the motional states of optically trapped two colliding atoms. Here, after preparing two elastically scattering $^{85}$Rb atoms in the three-dimensional ground-state in the optical tweezer, we employed this control in order to probe the colliding energies of elastic and inelastic channels. The combination of microwave spectra and corresponding s-wave pseudopotential model allows us to infer the effect of the state-dependent trapping potentials on the elastic colliding energies, as well as to reveal how the presence of inelastic interactions affects elastic part of the relative potential. Our work shows that the spin-motion coupling in a tight optical tweezer expand the experimental toolbox for fundamental studies of ultracold collisions in the two body systems with reactive collisions, and potentially for that of more complex interactions, such as optically trapped atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions.</description>

      <title>Interactions enable Thouless pumping in a nonsliding lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological 'Thouless' pump represents the quantised motion of particles in response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in physics because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be robust against perturbations and thus technologically useful. So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise a two-component Fermi gas in a dynamical superlattice which does not exhibit a sliding motion and remains trivial in the single-particle regime. However, when tuning interparticle interactions from zero to positive values, the system undergoes a transition from being stationary to drifting in one direction, consistent with quantised pumping in the first cycle. Remarkably, the topology of the interacting pump trajectory cannot be adiabatically connected to a non-interacting limit, highlighted by the fact that only one atom is transferred per cycle. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Light scattering properties beyond weak-field excitation in atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of optical properties of large atomic system, a weak laser driving is often assumed to simplify the system dynamics by linearly coupled equations. Here, we investigate the light scattering properties of atomic ensembles beyond weak-field excitation through the cumulant expansion method. By progressively incorporating higher-order correlations into the steady-state equations, an enhanced accuracy can be achieved in comparison to the exact solutions from solving a full density matrix. Our analysis reveals that, in the regime of weak dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), the first-order expansion yields satisfactory predictions for optical depth, while denser atomic configurations necessitate consideration of higher-order correlations. As the intensity of incident light increases, atom saturation effects become noticeable, giving rise to significant changes in light transparency, energy shift, and decay rate. This saturation phenomenon extends to subradiant atom arrays even under weak driving conditions, leading to substantial deviations from the linear model. Our findings demonstrate the mean-field models as good extensions to linear models as it balances both accuracy and computational complexity. However, the crucial role of higher-order cumulants in large and dense atom systems remains unclear, since it is challenging theoretically owing to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space in such light-matter interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: We present a tapered Paul trap whose radio frequency electrodes are inclined to the symmetric axis of the endcap electrodes, resulting in a funnel-shaped trapping potential. With this configuration, a charged particle confined in this trap has its radial degrees of freedom coupled to that of the axial direction. The same design was successfully used to experimentally realize a single-atom heat engine, and with this setup amplification of zeptonewton forces was implemented. In this paper, we show the design, implementation, and characterization of such an ion trap in detail. This system offers a high level of control over the ion's motion. Its novel features promise applications in the field of quantum thermodynamics, quantum sensing, and quantum information.</description>
