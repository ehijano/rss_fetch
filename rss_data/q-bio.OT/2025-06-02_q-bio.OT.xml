Abstract: This study evaluated the impact of Zinc (Zn) supplementation on the growth, yield, and seed quality of chickpea (Pisum sativum L.) under the semi-arid conditions of Kerman, Iran, across two growing seasons (2021-2022). A randomized complete block design was used with six treatments, including varying concentrations of zinc sulphate applied via foliar spraying (0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%) or irrigation (4, 8, 16 kg/ha), each applied twice-one and two months after greening. Results from the first year revealed significant differences in yield and yield components across treatments. The highest seed yield and protein content were achieved with foliar application of 0.5% and irrigation application of 8 kg/ . Zinc application enhanced reproductive processes, including pollen viability and stigma receptivity, leading to improved pod and seed attributes. However, excessive Zn application (e.g., 0.4% Zn) resulted in reduced plant performance, likely due to phytotoxicity. Leaf Zn concentration was significantly higher with 16 kg/ha applied via irrigation, while foliar applications at 0.1% also increased Zn uptake efficiently. The second growing season, however, showed no significant differences in traits across treatments, which was attributed to favorable climatic conditions mitigating Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency remains a critical challenge globally, particularly in calcareous and nutrient depleted soils, adversely affecting plant metabolism, root development, and nitrogen pathways. This study underscores the importance of optimizing Zn supplementation strategies to enhance yield and quality while avoiding toxicity. Findings provide practical recommendations for addressing Zn deficiencies in semi-arid cropping systems, offering valuable insights for sustainable chickpea production</description>
