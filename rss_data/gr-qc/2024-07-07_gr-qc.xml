      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations in Causal Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical fluctuations (such as the variance) of causal set quantities, with particular focus on the causal set action. To facilitate calculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations between causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient decomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions that depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used in causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\mathcal M$. Our work paves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects, such as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\Lambda$ cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Relational dynamics and Page-Wootters formalism in group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group field theory posits that spacetime is emergent and is hence defined without any background notion of space or time; dynamical questions are formulated in relational terms, in particular using (scalar) matter degrees of freedom as time. Unlike in canonical quantisation of gravitational systems, there is no obvious notion of coordinate transformations or constraints, and established quantisation methods cannot be directly applied. As a result, different canonical formalisms for group field theory have been discussed in the literature. We address these issues using a parametrised version of group field theory, in which all (geometry and matter) degrees of freedom evolve in a fiducial parameter. There is a constraint associated to the freedom of reparametrisation and the Dirac quantisation programme can be implemented. Using the "trinity of relational dynamics", we show that the resulting "clock-neutral" theory is entirely equivalent to a deparametrised canonical group field theory, interpreted in terms of the Page-Wootters formalism. Our results not only show that the deparametrised quantisation is fully covariant and can be seen as encoding the dynamics of joint quantum matter and geometry degrees of freedom, they also appear to be the first application of the Page-Wootters formalism directly to quantum gravity. We show extensions to a setting in which many independent gauge symmetries are introduced, which connects to the "multi-fingered time" idea in quantum gravity and provides a somewhat novel extension of the Page-Wootters formalism.</description>

      <title>Dark energy evolution from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If an ultraviolet fixed point renders quantum gravity renormalizable, the effective potential for a singlet scalar field -- the cosmon -- can be computed according to the corresponding scaling solution of the renormalization group equations. We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow away from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density. This results in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be called "quantum gravity quintessence". A first setting without quantum scale symmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of dark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast, a logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector responsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino coupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing neutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observation. The small number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum gravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be falsified.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole Analytically Connected to an asymptotically $AdS_5$ Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recent approach from reference [1] to obtain complete and analytic solutions (both brane and bulk) of a Simpson-Vaser (SV) geometry within a braneworld framework. The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk</description>

      <title>Physical Analysis of Spherical Stellar Structures in $f(\mathrm{Q},\mathrm{T})$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the viability and stability of compact stellar objects characterized by anisotropic matter in the framework of $f(\mathrm{Q},\mathrm{T})$ theory, where $\mathrm{Q}$ denotes non-metricity and $\mathrm{T}$ represents the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We consider a specific model of this theory to obtain explicit expressions for the field equations governing the behavior of matter and geometry in this context. Furthermore, the Karmarkar condition is employed to assess the configuration of static spherically symmetric structures. The values of unknown constants in the metric potentials are determined through matching conditions of the interior and exterior spacetimes. Various physical quantities such as fluid parameters, energy constraints, equation of state parameters, mass, compactness and redshift are graphically analyzed to evaluate the viability of the considered compact stars. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation is used to examine the equilibrium state of the stellar models. Moreover, the stability of the proposed compact stars is investigated through sound speed and adiabatic index methods. This study concludes that the proposed compact stars analyzed in this theoretical framework are viable and stable, as all the required conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Moment of inertia and compactness of quark stars within the context of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the metric formalism of $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity theories, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium structure of compact stars taking into account both isotropic and anisotropic pressure. For this purpose, we focus on the $f(R,T,L_m)= R+ \alpha TL_m$ model, where $\alpha$ is a free parameter. We derive the modified TOV equations and the relativistic moment of inertia in the slowly rotating approximation. Using an equation of state (EoS) for color-superconducting quark stars, we examine the effects of the $\alpha TL_m$ term on the different macroscopic properties of these stars. Our results reveal that the decrease of the parameter $\alpha$ leads to a noticeable increase in the maximum-mass values. For negative $\alpha$ with sufficiently small $\vert\alpha\vert$, we obtain a qualitative behavior similar to the general relativistic (GR) context, namely, it is possible to obtain a critical stellar configuration such that the mass reaches its maximum. However, for sufficiently large values of $\vert\alpha\vert$ keeping negative $\alpha$, the critical point cannot be found on the mass-radius diagram. We also find that the inclusion of anisotropic pressure can provide masses and radii quite consistent with the current observational measurements, which opens an outstanding window onto the physics of anisotropic quark stars. By comparing the $I-C$ relations of isotropic quark stars in modified gravity, we show that such a correlation remains almost unchanged as the parameter $\alpha$ varies from GR counterpart. On the other hand, given a fixed $\alpha$, the $I-C$ relation is insensitive to variations of the anisotropy parameter $\beta$ to $\mathcal{O}(4\%)$.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star in Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming static and spherically symmetric stars with perfect fluid matter, we used realistic equations of state to study neutron stars in covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. The structure profiles and properties of neutron stars such as mass, radius and compactness are obtained through numerical methods using quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. The results indicate that nonmetricity affects the interior profile deviations of the star, which in turn influence the properties of stars, as illustrated in the mass-radius relation diagram. This effect allows the star to accommodate either more or less matter compared to GR, resulting in a different total mass. For the quadratic model, we cannot generate larger masses, whereas the other two models can give consistent results for both smaller and larger masses of the observed stars. By tuning model parameters, we obtain $\mathcal{M}-\mathcal{R}$ diagrams that are compatible with observational constraints from NICER and LIGO.</description>

      <title>Exact cosmological solutions with magnetic field in the theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic and homogeneous cosmological models in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling of a scalar field to the curvature given by the function $\eta\cdot(\phi/2)\cdot G_{\mu\nu}\,\nabla^\mu \nabla^\nu \phi$ in the Lagrangian. We assume that the space-times are filled a global unidirectional electromagnetic field that minimally interacts with the scalar field. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time. The question arises about isotropization. In the theory under consideration, a zero scalar charge imposes a condition on the anisotropy level, namely its dynamics develops in a limited region. This condition uniquely determines a viable branch of solutions of the field equations. The magnetic energy density that corresponds to this branch is a bounded function of time. The sign of parameter $l=1+8\pi \varepsilon\eta \Lambda$ determines the properties of cosmological models, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant. The sign $\varepsilon=\pm 1$ defines the canonical scalar field and the phantom field, respectively. An inequality $\varepsilon/\eta&gt;0$ is a necessary condition for isotropization of models, but not sufficient. Three cases were considered: $l=0$, the isotropization does not occur; $l&gt;0$, there is isotropization; $l&lt;0$, there are two branches, one of which has the property of isotropization, and the other describes the Universe with collapse. The model with $l&lt;0$ has an anisotropic bounce and the Universe evolution begins with a non-zero volume value. Models of an infinitely expanding Universe eventually go into inflation mode with the scale factor $a(t)\propto e^{h_\eta\cdot t}$, $h_\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon}{3\eta}}$.</description>

      <title>Motion of charged particles in an electromagnetic swirling universe: The complete set of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the motion of electrically and magnetically charged particles in the electromagnetic swirling universe. We show that the equations of motion can be decoupled in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, revealing the existence of a fourth constant of motion. The equations of motion can be analytically integrated. The solutions are presented in terms of elementary and elliptic functions. In addition, we discuss the possible orbits for both uncharged particles (in which case the motion is geodesic) and charged particles, respectively. A typical orbit is bounded in the radial direction and escapes to infinity in the $z-$ direction. However, the presence of the electromagnetic fields also leads to the existence of planar orbits.</description>

      <title>Stability of a realistic astrophysical pulsar and its mass-radius relation in higher-order curvature gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this research is to explore compact celestial objects while considering the framework of an extended gravitational theory known as $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. The notations $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ denote the Ricci scalar and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, respectively. Radio pulsars, which are neutron stars with masses greater than 1.8 times that of the Sun ($M_\odot$), provide exceptional opportunities for delving into fundamental physics in extraordinary environments unparalleled in the observable universe and surpassing the capabilities of experiments conducted on Earth. Through the utilization of both the linear and quadratic expressions of the function { $f(\mathcal{G}) = \alpha_1 \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\alpha_1$ (with dimensional units of [${\textit length}^6$]) are incorporated}, we have achieved an accurate analytical solution for anisotropic perfect-fluid spheres in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. By integrating the dimensional parameters $\alpha_1$ and the compactness factor, defined as ${\mathcal C=\frac{2GM}{Rc^2}}$, we showcase our capacity to encompass and depict all physical characteristics within the stellar structure. We illustrate that the model is capable of producing a stable arrangement encompassing its physical and geometric properties. We illustrate that by utilizing the quadratic form of $\mathcal{G}$ in the $\mathcal{R}+f(\mathcal{G})$ framework, the ansatz of Krori-Barua establishes connection between pressure in the radial direction ($p_r$) using semi-analytical methods, pressure in the tangential direction ($p_t$), and density ($\rho$).</description>

      <title>Horizon entanglement area law from regular black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of regular black hole configurations via quantum analogs of entropy and energy -- namely, the entanglement entropy and entanglement energy -- near the event horizon of Bardeen and Hayward black holes. Following standard approaches, we introduce a quantum scalar field propagating in such black hole spacetimes and discretize the field degrees of freedom on a lattice of spherical shells. We observe that, at leading order, the entanglement entropy associated with the scalar field is proportional to Bekestein-Hawking entropy, while the corresponding entanglement energy scales proportionally to Komar energy. We then compute the heat capacity in both scenarios, discussing the black hole stability conditions and the possible appearance of second-order phase transitions. Finally, we extend our analysis to the black hole core, showing that in this sector entanglement energy serves as a valuable tool towards discriminating between singular and regular solutions.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum and transient of Kaluza-Klein black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum and dynamical instability, as well as the transient effect of the tensor perturbation for the so-called Maeda-Dadhich black hole, a type of Kaluza-Klein black hole, in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity have been investigated in framework of pseudospectrum. We cast the problem of solving quasinormal modes (QNMs) in AdS-like spacetime as the linear evolution problem of the non-normal operator in null slicing by using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. In terms of spectrum instability, based on the generalised eigenvalue problem, the QNM spectrum and $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum has been studied, while the open structure of $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum caused by the non-normality of operator indicates the spectrum instability. In terms of dynamical instability, the concept of the distance to dynamical instability has been firstly introduced in gravity aspects, which plays a crucial role in bridging the spectrum instability and the dynamical instability. We calculate the distance, named the complex stability radius, as parameters vary. Finally, we report the transient effect in the energy norm of the evolution operator, whose behaviour can be roughly reflected by the three kinds of abscissas in context of pseudospectrum, and explain the relationship between the waveform and the transient effect.</description>

      <title>Refined Thermodynamics of Black Holes with Proper Conserved Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field equations of a classical, geometric, theory of gravity, augmented with some semiclassical considerations strongly suggest that the gravitational field representing a stationary black hole can be simply described with a few thermodynamical coordinates and their conjugates that obey the four laws of thermodynamics plus the Smarr formula and the reverse isoperimetric inequality that bounds the maximum entropy for a given effective volume of space. Thermodynamics of black holes is a promising window to the quantum nature of black holes and hence it is important to understand all the details of these laws. The identification and the meaning of these thermodynamic coordinates depend on the gravity theory under consideration. For example, the existence of dimensionful coupling constants, such as the cosmological constant, changes the scaling properties of the theory, its solutions, and the laws of thermodynamics. Here we show, using the background Killing charge method which applies to any gravity theory, how the thermodynamics of black holes such as the $D$ dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in cosmological Einstein's theory and the spherically symmetric black holes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory changes. We give the effective volume of black holes which are regular in every dimension even in the absence of a cosmological constant. The methods applied here can be used in any geometric theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Geometric relational framework for general-relativistic gauge field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We remind how relationality arises as the core insight of general-relativistic gauge field theories from the articulation of the generalised hole and point-coincidence arguments. Hence, a compelling case for a manifestly relational framework ensues naturally. We propose our formulation for such a framework, based on a significant development of the dressing field method of symmetry reduction.
  We first develop a version for the group $\text{Aut}(P)$ of automorphisms of a principal bundle $P$ over a manifold $M$, as it is the most natural and elegant, and as $P$ hosts all the mathematical structures relevant to general-relativistic gauge field theory. Yet, as the standard formulation is local, on $M$, we then develop the relational framework for local field theory. It manifestly implements the generalised point-coincidence argument, whereby the physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and define, coordinatise, the physical spacetime itself.

      <title>Signatures of dark and baryonic structures on weakly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing offers a powerful tool for exploring the matter distribution in the Universe. Thanks to their low frequencies and phase coherence, gravitational waves (GWs) allow for the observation of novel wave-optics features (WOFs) in lensing, inaccessible to electromagnetic signals. Combined with the existing accurate source models, lensed GWs can be used to infer the properties of gravitational lenses. The prospect is particularly compelling for space-borne detectors, where the high signal-to-noise ratio expected from massive black hole binary mergers allows WOFs to be distinguished deep into the weak lensing regime, drastically increasing the detection probability. Here, we investigate in detail the capacity of the LISA mission to detect WOFs caused by dark matter halos, galaxies and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within them. We estimate the total optical depth to be $\lambda_{\rm tot} \sim 6 \times 10 ^{-3}$ for the loudest binaries of total mass $M_{\rm BBH} \sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$, with the dominant contribution coming from SMBHs. We also find that WOFs in low-mass binaries $M_{\rm BBH} \sim 10^4 M_{\odot}$ are more likely due to the central galaxies. Within our model of gravitational lenses, we predict $\mathcal{O}(0.1)-\mathcal{O}(1)$ weakly-lensed events to be detectable during the 5 years of LISA mission, depending on the source population models. We show that WOFs signatures are very sensitive to the properties of dark-matter halos with $M_{\rm vir}\in (10^6-10^8)M_\odot$: increasing the compactness parameter by $\sim 3$ in that range raises the detection rate by $\sim 26$. Additionally, we show that collective effects from the complex inner halo structure can further enhance detectability. This suggests that lensed GWs in LISA will be an excellent probe of dark-matter theories, baryonic and halo sub-structures.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes on Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a rigorous framework for defining quasinormal modes on stationary, asymptotically flat spacetimes as isolated eigenvalues of the infinitesimal generator of time translations. We consider time functions corresponding to a foliation of asymptotically hyperboloidal hypersurfaces and restrict to suitable Hilbert spaces of functions. These functions have finite Sobolev regularity in bounded regions, but need to be Gevrey-regular at null infinity. This framework is developed in the context of sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes, but also gives uniform-in-$\Lambda$ resolvent estimates on Kerr--de Sitter spacetimes with a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$. As a corollary, we also construct the meromorphic continuation (in a sector of the complex plane) of the cut-off resolvent in Kerr that is associated to the standard Boyer--Lindquist time function. The framework introduced in this paper bridges different notions of quasinormal modes found in the literature. As further applications of our methods, we prove stability of quasinormal frequencies in a sector of the complex plane, with respect to suitably small perturbations and establish convergence properties for Kerr--de Sitter quasinormal frequencies when the cosmological constant approaches zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dust ball with an electrically charged central core and study its quantum spectrum by quantising the geodesic equation for individual dust particles in the corresponding Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. As in the neutral case investigated previously, we find a ground state of the dust ball with the size of a fraction of the outer horizon. Moreover, we determine a self-consistent configuration of layers in the ground state corresponding to an effective mass function that increases linearly with the areal radius and has no inner horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the marginal loosely trapped surface (marginal LTS) for the Kerr spacetime with a small Kerr parameter perturbatively, where the LTS condition is saturated. An LTS is a surface that specifies the strong gravity region, which is a generalization of the photon sphere in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It turns out that there are an infinite number of marginal LTSs. At the leading order of the small Kerr parameter, all of the marginal LTSs have the same area. However, one can see that the maximal marginal LTS among them is uniquely determined at the higher order.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically compute the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in Type III hilltop inflation models under the slow-roll approximation. The model parameters are constrained using current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. The curvature perturbations that exit the horizon at small scales show sufficiently large amplitudes to produce primordial black holes (PBHs). We then consider the quantum one-loop corrections in these models from both the self-interaction of the inflaton and its interaction with the waterfall field. We show the loop corrections in both cases for 60 e-folds of inflation are negligible, ensuring the tree-level results are reliable within the chosen parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Precision cosmology with exact inhomogeneous solutions of General Relativity: the Szekeres models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact Friedman solution to the field equations of General Relativity (GR) describing an homogeneous and isotropic universe together with its linear and higher-order perturbations are the theoretical roots of the current standard model of cosmology. However, despite its global successes, this standard model currently faces a number of tensions and anomalies, which occur mostly from a mismatch between early and late cosmic time region depictions. Actually, in the era of precision cosmology, the late inhomogeneities in the densities of the Universe components can no more be neglected. Moreover, since GR is fundamentally nonlinear, any linear perturbation theory is doomed to fail at reproducing precisely its features, while higher-order perturbed FLRW models cannot either claim the status of exact solution to Einstein's field equations. Fortunately, other GR solutions exist which are best suited for this purpose, e. g., exact inhomogeneous solutions able to represent a matter-cosmological constant dominated universe region. Among these, the Szekeres solution, which is devoid of any symmetry, appears as a proper tool for our purpose. Moreover, since these solutions possess the FLRW model as a homogeneous limit, they can be very smoothly matched to the standard representation at the inhomogeneity-homogeneity transition. In this paper, the Szekeres solution and its main interesting properties, as well as the equations needed to use this solution in a cosmological context are presented. Then the prospects for a broader use of its abilities are sketched out. In particular, the use of neural networks is proposed to allow, in the future, the fitting of the huge amount of data becoming available to constrain the arbitrary functions and the constant parameters characterizing the Szekeres model, running for representing our late Universe with an increased precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we study spacetimes of cosmological interest, without making any symmetry assumptions. We prove a rigid Hawking singularity theorem for positive cosmological constant, which sharpens known results. In particular, it implies that any spacetime with $\operatorname{Ric} \geq -ng$ in timelike directions and containing a compact Cauchy hypersurface with mean curvature $H \geq n$ is timelike incomplete. We also study the properties of cosmological time and volume functions, addressing questions such as: When do they satisfy the regularity condition? When are the level sets Cauchy hypersurfaces? What can one say about the mean curvature of the level sets? This naturally leads to consideration of Hawking type singularity theorems for Cauchy surfaces satisfying mean curvature inequalities in a certain weak sense.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

Abstract: Observational data of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) shadow released by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) are used to investigate eventual deviations in the black hole shadow radius, aiming to seek physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) coming from extra-dimensional theory. We consider the brane-world scenario described by the Randall-Sundrum model and determine the black hole shadow radius correction owing to the higher dimension. From data of the shadow radius in units of BH mass determined by KECK- and VLTI-based estimates, we imposed restrictions on the deviation obtained, and one sets an upper limit to the curvature radius of Anti-de Sitter ($\mathrm{AdS_{5}}$) spacetime $\ell\lesssim4.3\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{AU}$ (at $95\%$ confidence level).</description>

      <title>A unified approach to coupled homogeneous linear wave propagation in generic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation is a common occurrence in all of physics. A linear approximation provides a simpler way to describe various fields related to observable phenomena in laboratory physics as well as astronomy and cosmology, allowing us to probe gravitation through its effect on the trajectories of particles associated with those fields. This paper proposes a unified framework to describe the wave propagation of a set of interacting tensor fields that obey coupled homogeneous linear second-order partial differential equations for arbitrary curved spacetimes, both Lorentzian and metric-affine. We use JWKB Ans\"atze for all fields, written in terms of a perturbation parameter proportional to a representative wavelength among them, deriving a set of hierarchical algebraic and differential equations that link the fields' phases and different order amplitudes. This allows us to reobtain the well-known laws of geometrical optics and beyond geometrical optics in a generalized form, showing that these laws are independent of the rank of the fields involved. This is true as long as what we refer to as the kinetic tensor of a given field satisfies a set of diagonality conditions, which further imply a handful of simplifications on the transport equations obtained in the subleading orders of the JWKB Ans\"atze. We explore these results in several notable examples in Lorentzian and metric-affine spacetimes, illustrating the reach of our derivations in general relativity, reduced Horndeski theories, spacetimes with completely antisymmetric torsion and Weyl spacetimes. The formalism presented herein lays the groundwork for the study of rays associated with different types of waves in curved spacetimes and provides the tools to compute modifications to their brightness evolution laws, consequential distance duality relations, and beyond geometrical optics phenomena.</description>

Abstract: In the context of an extended General Relativity theory with boundary terms included, we introduce a new nonlinear quantum algebra involving a quantum differential operator, with the aim to calculate quantum geometric alterations when a particle is created in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black-hole by the Hawking radiation mechanism. The boundary terms in the varied action give rise to modifications in the geometric background, which are investigated by analyzing the metric tensor and the Ricci curvature within the framework of a renormalized quantum theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology and origin of late-time tails in eccentric binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the late-time tail behavior in gravitational waves from merging eccentric binary black holes (BBH) using black hole perturbation theory. For simplicity, we focus only on the dominant quadrupolar mode of the radiation. We demonstrate that such tails become more prominent as eccentricity increases. Exploring the phenomenology of the tails in both spinning and non-spinning eccentric binaries, with the spin magnitude varying from $\chi=-0.6$ to $\chi=+0.6$ and eccentricity as high as $e=0.98$, we find that these tails can be well approximated by a slowly decaying power law. We study the power law for varying systems and find that the power law exponent lies close to the theoretically expected value $-4$. Finally, using both plunge geodesic and radiation-reaction-driven orbits, we perform a series of numerical experiments to understand the origin of the tails in BBH simulations. Our results suggest that the late-time tails are strongly excited in eccentric BBH systems when the smaller black hole is in the neighborhood of the apocenter, as opposed to any structure in the strong field of the larger black hole. Our analysis framework is publicly available through the \texttt{gwtails} Python package.</description>

      <title>From Inflation to Quintessence: a History of the Universe in String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a type IIB 4D string model with stabilised moduli which is able to describe the history of the universe from inflation to quintessence. The underlying Calabi-Yau volume is controlled by two moduli which are stabilised by perturbative effects. The lighter of them drives Fibre Inflation at a large energy scale. The two associated axions are ultra-light since they are lifted only at the non-perturbative level. The lighter of them can drive quintessence if its decay constant is large enough to prevent quantum diffusion during inflation from ruining the initial conditions. The right dark energy scale can be obtained via a large suppression from poly-instanton effects. The heavier axion gives a negligible contribution to dark matter since it starts oscillating after matter-radiation equality. If instead none of the two axions has a large decay constant, a mild alignment allows the lighter axion to drive quintessence, while the heavier can be at most a few percent of dark matter due to isocurvature and UV bounds. In both cases dark matter can also come from either primordial black holes or the QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stochastic Template Bank using Inner Product Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources like neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ for eccentric and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.</description>

Such spacetimes arise via holographic braneworlds and are exact solutions to an induced higher-derivative theory of gravity consistently coupled to a large$-c$ quantum field theory with an ultraviolet cutoff, accounting for all orders of semi-classical backreaction. Notably, such quantum-corrected black holes are much larger than the Planck length. We describe the geometry and horizon thermodynamics of a host of asymptotically (anti-) de Sitter and flat quantum black holes. A summary of higher-dimensional extensions is given. We survey multiple applications of quantum black holes and braneworld holography.</description>

      <title>The effects of SUSY on the emergent spacetime in the Lorentzian type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentzian type IIB matrix model is a promising candidate for a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. Recently we performed complex Langevin simulations by adding a Lorentz invariant mass term as an IR regulator and found a (1+1)-dimensional expanding spacetime with a Lorentzian signature emerging dynamically at late times when the fermionic contribution is omitted. Here we find that this is merely an artifact of the Lorentz boosts by showing that the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is eliminated if one chooses a Lorentz frame appropriately. On the other hand, when we include the fermionic contribution, we find some evidence suggesting the emergence of a smooth (3+1)-dimensional expanding Lorentzian spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Inflation as the leading paradigm depicting the very early universe physics could leave imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Using currently available CMB observations, we give the first direct evidence of inflation. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results including the energy scale of inflation, inflaton field excursion, Hubble expansion rate during inflation, equation of state of inflation, primordial tensor non-Gaussianity, primordial tensor power spectrum, B-mode anisotropy and inflationary gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>Projections of the uncertainty on the compact binary population background using popstock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has announced the detection of almost 100 binary black holes so far, which have been used in several studies to infer the features of the underlying binary black hole population. From these, it is possible to predict the overall gravitational-wave (GW) fractional energy density contributed by black holes throughout the Universe, and thus estimate the gravitational-wave background (GWB) spectrum emitted in the current GW detector band. These predictions are fundamental in our forecasts for background detection and characterization, with both present and future instruments. The uncertainties in the inferred population strongly impact the predicted energy spectrum, and in this paper we present a new, flexible method to quickly calculate the energy spectrum for varying black hole population features such as the mass spectrum and redshift distribution. We implement this method in an open-access package, popstock, and extensively test its capabilities. Using popstock, we investigate how uncertainties in these distributions impact our detection capabilities and present several caveats for background estimation. In particular, we find that the standard assumption that the background signal follows a 2/3 power-law at low frequencies is both waveform and mass-model dependent, and that the signal power-law is likely shallower than previously modelled, given the current waveform and population knowledge.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Signatures of Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes with Circumbinary Disks in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes may have circumbinary disks if formed through common-envelope evolution or within gaseous environments. Disks can drive binaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden and circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for disk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven evolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find that binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity, $0.2\lesssim e_\mathrm{eq} \lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once they transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases rapidly; we find that binaries with long-lived disks will likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\sim 10^{-2}$ at $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's initial mass ratio. This may lead binary black holes with CBDs observed in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the q-entropy composition for independent events has exactly the same form as the Pythagorean theorem in hyperbolic geometry. We justify the formal relation of hyperbolic geometry with the q-entropy through the use of the $\kappa$-entropy, which is directly related to the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space. We comment on the relation between orthogonality in this form of the Pythagorean theorem and the independence of the probability distributions appearing in the q-entropy composition through the use of the Dvoretzky-Rogers lemma.</description>

      <title>Expected insights on type Ia supernovae from LISA's gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of type Ia supernovae have long been debated, primarily due to the elusiveness of the progenitor systems to traditional electromagnetic observation methods. We argue that gravitational wave observations with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) offer the most promising way to test one of the leading progenitor scenarios - the double-degenerate scenario, which involves a binary system of two white dwarf stars. In this study, we review published results, supplementing them with additional calculations for the context of type Ia supernovae. We discuss that LISA will be able to provide a complete sample of double white dwarf type Ia supernova progenitors with orbital period less than 16-11 minutes (gravitational wave frequencies above 2-3 milli-Hertz). Such a sample will enable a statistical validation of the double-degenerate scenario by simply counting whether LISA detects enough double white dwarf binaries to account the measured type Ia merger rate in Milky Way-like galaxies. Additionally, we illustrate how LISA's capability to measure the chirp mass will set lower bounds on the primary mass, revealing whether detected double white dwarf binaries will eventually result in a type Ia supernova. We estimate that the expected LISA constraints on the type Ia merger rate for the Milky Way will be 4-9%. We also discuss the potential gravitational wave signal from a type Ia supernova assuming a double detonation mechanism and explore how multi-messenger observations could significantly advance our understanding of these transient phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic soft theorems and soft spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit , $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Detecting the dark sector through scalar-induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of cosmological scalar perturbations in the case that the background radiation is weakly coupled to a light scalar field $\phi$. The light scalar $\phi$ is a homogeneous background field with a large initial value. In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an effective mass to $\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The oscillations of $\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state parameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify subhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification of scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves background~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave observers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of $\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is generally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and we take the interaction between $\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to illustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling coefficient $\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the resulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers including LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-dependent $\mathcal{O}(1/G)$ deformation of pure de Sitter (dS) space in dS gravity coupled to a massless scalar field. It is the dS counterpart of the AdS Janus deformation and interpolates two asymptotically dS spaces in the far past and the far future with a single deformation parameter. The Penrose diagram can be elongated along the time direction indefinitely as the deformation becomes large. After studying the classical properties of the geometry such as the area theorem and the fluctuation by a matter field, we explore the algebraic structure of the field operators on the deformed spacetime. We argue that the algebra is a von Neumann factor of type II$_\infty$ for small deformations, but there occurs a transition to type I$_\infty$ as the deformation increases so that the neck region of the deformed space becomes a Lorentzian cylinder.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with alternative cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, we use model-independent 2D BAO data and compare the results to those obtained using 3D BAO data. As a concrete example, we investigate the cosmological models provided by bimetric gravity, a modified theory of gravity that transitions from a negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. We conclude that the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exponential modification for the action of an AdS black hole in the absence of a matter field. An approximated black hole solution is obtained up to the third order of perturbation coefficient. A thermodynamic investigation in canonical ensemble shows that the behavior of a Van der Waals fluid is not seen in this model. Nevertheless, the study of thermodynamic potentials and other related quantities suggests that the thermodynamic phase transitions of the first and second types can occur in this model. The forms of the phase transitions are more similar to the Hawking-Page phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various scenarios of cosmic inflation enhance the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at frequencies detectable by the LISA detector. We develop tools for a template-based analysis of the SGWB and introduce a template databank to describe well-motivated signals from inflation, prototype their template-based searches, and forecast their reconstruction with LISA. Specifically, we classify seven templates based on their signal frequency shape, and we identify representative fundamental physics models leading to them. By running a template-based analysis, we forecast the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the template parameters of representative benchmark signals, with and without galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We identify the parameter regions that can be probed by LISA within each template. Finally, we investigate how our signal reconstructions shed light on fundamental physics models of inflation: we discuss their impact for measurements of \emph{e.g.,} ~the couplings of inflationary axions to gauge fields; the graviton mass during inflation; the fluctuation seeds of primordial black holes; the consequences of excited states during inflation, and the presence of small-scale spectral features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic duality (also known as AdS/CFT correspondence or gauge/gravity duality) postulates that strongly coupled quantum field theories can be described in a dual way in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter space. One of the cornerstones of this duality is the description of thermal states as black holes with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. This idea has led to valuable insights into such fields as transport theory and relativistic hydrodynamics. The quasinormal modes of such black holes play a decisive role and therefore their stability properties are of upmost interest for the holographic duality. We review recent results using the method of pseudospectra in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LISA Pathfinder was a mission designed to test key technologies required for gravitational wave detection in space. Magnetically driven forces play a key role in the instrument sensitivity in the low-frequency regime, which corresponds to the measurement band of interest for future space-borne gravitational wave observatories. Magnetic-induced forces couple to the test mass motion, introducing a contribution to the relative acceleration noise between the free falling test masses. In this Letter we present the first complete estimate of this term of the instrument performance model. Our results set the magnetic-induced acceleration noise during the February 2017 noise run of $\rm 0.25_{-0.08}^{+0.15}\,fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 1 mHz and $\rm 1.01_{-0.24}^{+0.73}\, fm\,s^{-2}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at 0.1 mHz. We also discuss how the non-stationarities of the interplanetary magnetic field can affect these values during extreme space weather conditions.</description>

Abstract: A precise characterization of the magnetic properties of LISA Pathfinder free falling test-masses is of special interest for future gravitational wave observatory in space. Magnetic forces have an important impact on the instrument sensitivity in the low frequency regime below the millihertz. In this paper we report on the magnetic injection experiments performed throughout LISA Pathfinder operations. We show how these experiments allowed a high precision estimate of the instrument magnetic parameters. The remanent magnetic moment was found to have a modulus of $(0.245\pm0.081)\,\rm{nAm}^2$, the x-component of the background magnetic field within the test masses position was measured to be $(414 \pm 74)$ nT and its gradient had a value of $(-7.4\pm 2.1)\,\mu$T/m. Finally, we also measured the test mass magnetic susceptibility to be $(-3.35\pm0.15)\times$10$^{-5}$ in the low frequency regime. All results are in agreement with on-ground estimates.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous definition of quasinormal modes for the Kerr black hole. They are obtained as the discrete set of poles of the meromorphically continued cutoff resolvent. The construction combines the method of complex scaling near asymptotically flat infinity with microlocal methods near the black hole horizon. We study the distribution of quasinormal modes in both the high and low energy regimes. We establish the existence of a high energy spectral gap and exclude the accumulation of quasinormal modes at zero energy.</description>

      <title>On the nature of ensembles from gravitational path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime wormholes in gravitational path integrals have long been interpreted in terms of ensembles of theories. Here we probe what sort of theories such ensembles might contain. Careful consideration of a simple $d=2$ topological model indicates that the Hilbert space structure of a general ensemble element fails to factorize over disconnected Cauchy-surface boundaries, and in particular that its Hilbert space ${\cal H}_{N_{CS\partial}}$ for $N_{CS\partial}$ Cauchy-surface boundaries fails to be positive definite when the number $N_{CS\partial}$ of disconnected such boundaries is large. This suggests a generalization of the AdS/CFT correspondence in which a bulk theory is dual to an ensemble of theories that deviate from standard CFTs by violating both locality and positivity (at least under certain circumstances). Since violations of positivity are undesirable, we propose that positivity-violating elements of the ensemble be removed when studying physics in asymptotically AdS spacetimes (or in other contexts in which Cauchy surfaces have asymptotic boundaries), perhaps reducing the ensemble to a single standard CFT. Nevertheless, properties of any remaining CFTs that are uncorrelated with positivity of ${\cal H}_{N_{CS\partial}}$ at large $N_{CS\partial}$will agree with those of typical elements of the full ensemble and may be computed using the ensemble average.
  On the other hand, elements that violate positivity at large $N_{CS\partial}$ can still have a positive-definite cosmological sector with $N_{CS\partial}=0$. Such elements then define a basis for a Hilbert space describing such cosmologies. In contrast to the cases in which Cauchy-surfaces are allowed to have boundaries, we argue that the resulting Hilbert space need not decohere into single-state theories. As a result, familiar physics might be more easily recovered from this new scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of the breaking of diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance in the electromagnetic sector. We consider the breaking of Diff symmetry down to the subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) and analyse its impact on the generation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields. We show that Diff breaking induces a breaking of conformal invariance that modifies the way in which magnetic fields evolve on super-Hubble scales. The effects of the highly conductive plasma in the evolution are also analysed. We obtain the magnetic power spectrum today and discuss the parameter regions that yield intergalactic magnetic fields compatible with current observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a deformation quantization, in the sense of Rieffel, for \textit{all} globally hyperbolic spacetimes with a Poisson structure. The Poisson structures have to satisfy Fedosov type requirements in order for the deformed product to be associative. We apply the novel deformation to quantum field theories and their respective states and we prove that the deformed state (i.e.\ a state in non-commutative spacetime) has a singularity structure resembling Minkowski, i.e.\ is \textit{Hadamard}, if the undeformed state is Hadamard. This proves that the Hadamard condition, and hence the quantum field theoretical implementation of the equivalence principle is a general concept that holds in spacetimes with quantum features (i.e. a non-commutative spacetime).</description>

      <title>General-relativistic wave$-$particle duality with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the four-velocity of a Dirac particle is related to its relativistic wave function by $u^i=\bar{\psi}\gamma^i\psi/\bar{\psi}\psi$. This relativistic wave$-$particle duality relation is demonstrated for a free particle related to a plane wave in a flat spacetime. For a curved spacetime with torsion, the momentum four-vector of a spinor is related to a generator of translation, given by a covariant derivative. The spin angular momentum four-tensor of a spinor is related to a generator of rotation in the Lorentz group. We use the covariant conservation laws for the spin and energy$-$momentum tensors for a spinor field in the presence of the Einstein$-$Cartan torsion to show that if the wave satisfies the curved Dirac equation, then the four-velocity, four-momentum, and spin satisfy the classical Mathisson$-$Papapetrou equations of motion. We show that these equations reduce to the geodesic equation. Consequently, the motion of a particle guided by the four-velocity in the pilot-wave quantum mechanics coincides with the geodesic motion determined by spacetime. We also show how the duality and the operator form of the Mathisson$-$Papapetrou equations arise from the covariant Heisenberg equation of motion in the presence of torsion.</description>

      <title>\boldmath $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02813v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a foundationally quantum approach to gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems that randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank internal symmetries. It is shown that their states depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry, and a relative dynamics can be defined by selection of a subsystem as clock. The action has the form of a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Therefore, $SU(\infty)$-QGR is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, dynamics is similar to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. In particular, we show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of subsystems with the rest of the Universe, and demonstrate irrelevance of geometry of the parameter space for observables. Hence, $SU(\infty)$-QGR deviates from gauge-gravity duality models, because the classical spacetime is an emergent effective geometry with negative signature, reflecting relative variation of quantum states of subsystems and quantum uncertainties. We also briefly discuss $SU(\infty)$-QGR specific models for dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this research paper is to investigate curvature inheritance symmetry in conformally flat spacetime. Curvature inheritance symmetry in conformally flat spacetime is shown to be a conformal motion. We have proven that a conformally flat spacetime reduces to Einstein spacetime if admits curvature inheritance symmetry. A few results on conformally flat spacetimes that obey Einstein's field equation with or without a cosmological constant, if admits the curvature inheritance symmetry. The energy-momentum tensor is to be covariantly constant in a 4-dimensional relativistic perfect fluid spacetime which is also conformally flat spacetime, admits curvature inheritance, and obeys Einstein's field equations in the presence of a cosmological constant. Moreover, it is also obtained that such spacetimes with perfect fluid satisfy the the vacuum-like equation of state consecutively it is dark matter. Finally, in the third part of the article, the case compatible with all Theorems from Theorem \ref{Th2.1} to Theorem \ref{Th2.5n} is shown. On the other hand, it has also been emphasized that it is an example of de Sitter spacetime. It has been demonstrated that this spacetime also has a conformal killing vector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17847v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-accuracy gravitational-wave modeling demands going beyond linear, first-order perturbation theory. Particularly motivated by the need for second-order perturbative models of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals and black hole ringdowns, we present practical spherical-harmonic decompositions of the Einstein equation, Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, and Teukolsky equation at second perturbative order in a Schwarzschild background. Our formulations are covariant on the $t$--$r$ plane and on the two-sphere, and we express the field equations in terms of gauge-invariant metric perturbations. In a companion Mathematica package, PerturbationEquations, we provide these invariant formulas as well as the analogous formulas in terms of raw, gauge-dependent metric perturbations. Our decomposition of the second-order Einstein equation, when specialized to the Lorenz gauge, was a key ingredient in recent second-order self-force calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 021101 (2020); ibid. 127, 151102 (2021); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent series of papers new exact analytical solutions of Einstein equations representing interior spacetimes sourced by stationary rigidly rotating cylinders of fluids have been displayed. We have first considered a fluid with an axially directed pressure C\'el\'erier, Phys. Rev. D 104, 064040 (2021), J. Math. Phys. 64, 032501 (2023), then a perfect fluid, J. Math. Phys. 64, 022501 (2023), followed by a fluid with an azimuthally directed pressure, J. Math. Phys. 64, 042501 (2023), and finally a fluid where the anisotropic pressure is radially oriented, J. Math. Phys. 64, 052502 (2023). This work is being currently extended to the cases of differentially rotating irrotational fluids. The results are presented in a new series of papers considering, in turn, a perfect fluid source, arXiv:2305.11565 [gr-qc], and the same three anisotropic pressure cases. Here, fluids with an axially directed pressure are considered. A general method for generating new mathematical solutions to the field equations is displayed and three classes are presented so as to exemplify this recipe. Their mathematical and physical properties are analyzed. The first class, named class A, whose other mathematical and physical properties determine a standard configuration, is shown to exhibit a singular axis of symmetry which can be considered as an awkward drawback. The second class, class B, is free from such a singularity but appears to exhibit a negative energy density which characterizes a rather exotic kind of matter. The third class, class C, is the best behaved since it possesses the main properties expected from spacetimes sourced by rather standard fluids. The three classes are matched to an exterior Lewis-Weyl vacuum and the conditions for avoiding an angular deficit are discussed. A comparison with the rigidly rotating fluid case is provided.</description>

Abstract: In a recent series of papers, new exact analytical solutions to field equations of General Relativity representing interior spacetimes sourced by stationary rigidly rotating cylinders of fluids with various equations of state have been displayed. This work is currently extended to the case of differentially rotating irrotational fluids. The results are presented in a new series of papers considering, in turn, a perfect fluid source, arXiv:2305.11565 [gr-qc], as well as the three anisotropic pressure cases already studied in the rigidly rotating configuration. The axially directed pressure case has already been developed in arXiv:2307.07263. Here, a fluid with an azimuthally directed pressure is considered. A general method for generating the corresponding new mathematical solutions to the field equations when the ratio $h=$pressure/energy density varies with the radial coordinate is proposed, and a class of solutions exemplifying this recipe is derived. Then, the case where $h=const.$ is solved. It splits into two subclasses depending on the value of $h$. The mathematical and physical properties of these three classes are analyzed which provides some constraints on $h$, different for each class and subclass. Their matching to an exterior Lewis-Weyl vacuum and the conditions for avoiding an angular deficit are discussed. A comparison with the rigidly rotating fluid case is provided.</description>

The results are presented in a new series of papers considering, in turn, a perfect fluid source, as well as the three anisotropic pressure cases already studied in the rigidly rotating configuration. Here, we analyze the case of a fluid with radially directed pressure. Four classes of solutions are identified from the field equations. Among them, class I and III are fully integrated, and their mathematical and physical properties are studied, which implies a ruling out of class III for lack of proper metric signature. For each of the two other classes, a set of simplified differential equation is displayed so as to ease their possible further numerical integration. Finally, a comparison with the corresponding rigidly rotating fluid solution is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by the dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase space trajectories.</description>

Abstract: The shadow of a black hole or a collapsing star is of great importance as we can extract important properties of the object and of the surrounding spacetime from the shadow profile. It can also be used to distinguish different types of black holes and ultra compact objects. In this work, we have analytically calculated the shadow of a higher dimensional collapsing dark star, described by higher dimensional Vaidya metric, by choosing a slightly generalized version of Misner--Sharp mass function. We have also numerically investigated the properties of the shadows of the black holes and the collapsing stars for a slightly more general mass function. Examining the potential influence of extra spatial dimensions on the shadow, we have explored the possibility of distinguishing higher dimensions from the standard four-dimensional spacetime.</description>

      <title>When the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods do not coincide: the impact of post-Keplerian perturbing accelerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a purely Keplerian picture, the anomalistic, draconitic and sidereal orbital periods of a test particle orbiting a massive body coincide with each other. Such a degeneracy is removed when a post-Keplerian perturbing acceleration enters the equations of motion yielding generally different corrections to the Keplerian period for the three aforementioned characteristic orbital timescales. They are analytically worked out in the case of the accelerations induced by the general relativistic post-Newtonian gravitoelectromagnetic fields and, to the Newtonian level, by the oblateness of the central body as well. The resulting expressions hold for completely general orbital configurations and spatial orientations of the spin axis of the primary. Astronomical systems characterized by extremely accurate measurements of the orbital periods like, e.g., transiting exoplanets and binary pulsars, may offer potentially viable scenarios for measuring such post--Keplerian features of motion, at least in principle. As an example, the sidereal period of the brown dwarf WD1032 + 011 b is currently known with an uncertainty as small as $\simeq 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{s}$, while its predicted post-Newtonian gravitoelectric correction amounts to $0.07\,\mathrm{s}$; however, the accuracy with which the Keplerian period can be calculated is just 572 s. For the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the largest relativistic correction to the anomalistic period amounts to a few tenths of a second, given a measurement error of such a characteristic orbital timescale as small as $\simeq 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{s}$. On the other hand, the Keplerian term can be currently calculated just to a $\simeq 9$ s accuracy. In principle, measuring at least two of the three characteristic orbital periods for the same system independently would allow to cancel out their common Keplerian component provided that their difference is taken.</description>

      <title>Interior spacetimes sourced by stationary differentially rotating irrotational cylindrical fluids: anisotropic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent series of papers new exact analytical interior spacetimes sourced by stationary rigidly rotating cylinders of fluids have been displayed. A fluid with an axially directed pressure has been first considered, then a perfect fluid, followed by a fluid with an azimuthally directed pressure, and, finally, by a fluid where the pressure is radially oriented. The perfect fluid configuration has subsequently been extended to the case of differential rotation. In the present paper, three different cases of anisotropic pressure analogous to those studied for rigidly rotating motion are considered in turn for differentially rotating fluids. General methods for generating mathematical solutions to the field equations and physically well-behaved examples are displayed for the axial and azimuthal pressure cases. As regards radial pressure fluids, four classes of solutions naturally emerge from the corresponding Einstein's equations, among which one class, after being fully integrated, exhibits physically well-behaved solutions.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Symmetry Operators in Kerr--NUT--AdS Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Kerr--NUT--AdS spacetimes possess hidden symmetries encoded in the so-called principal Killing--Yano tensor. In this paper, focusing on the four-dimensional case, we obtain a number of symmetry operators for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, that are of degree two (to be defined below) and homogeneous in the principal tensor. In particular, by considering homogeneous operators that are linear, quadratic, and cubic in the principal tensor, we recover a complete set of 4 mutually commuting operators for scalar perturbations, underlying the separability of (massive) scalar wave equation. Proceeding to vector and tensor perturbations of the Kerr--NUT--AdS spacetimes, we find a set of 7 and 8 commuting operators, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such operators can be used to separate the corresponding spin 1 and spin 2 test field equations in these spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: The future Japanese project for the detection of gravitational waves in space is planned as DECIGO. To achieve various scientific missions, including the verification of cosmic inflation through the detection of primordial gravitational waves as the main objective, DECIGO is designed to have high sensitivity in the frequency band from $0.1$ to $1$ Hz, with arms of length 1000 km. Furthermore, the use of the Fabry-Perot cavity in these arms has been established for the DECIGO project. In this paper, we scrutinize the significance of the Fabry-Perot cavity for promoting this project, with a focus on the possibility of observing gravitational waves from cosmic inflation and binary compact star systems as indicators. The results show that using the Fabry-Perot cavity is extremely beneficial for detecting them, and it is anticipated to enable the opening of a new window in gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Torsion and Chern-Simons gravity in 4D space-times from a Geometrodynamical four-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The space-time geometry in any inertial frame is described by the line-element $ds^2= \eta_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$. Now, not only the Minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ is invariant under proper Lorentz transformations, the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $ too is. In general relativity (GR), $\eta_{\mu \nu} $ of the flat space-time gets generalized to a dynamical, space-time dependent metric tensor $ g_{\mu \nu} $ that characterizes a curved space-time geometry. In the present study, it is put forward that the flat space-time Levi-Civita tensor gets elevated to a dynamical four-form field $\tilde {w} $ in curved space-time manifolds, i.e. $e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} \rightarrow w_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} (x) = \phi (x) \ e_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} $, so that $\tilde {w} = {1\over {4!}} \ w_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} \ \tilde{d} x^\mu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\nu \wedge \tilde{d} x^\rho \wedge \tilde{d} x^\sigma$. It is shown that this geometrodynamical four-form field extends GR by leading naturally to a torsion in the theory as well as to a Chern-Simons gravity. It is demonstrated that the scalar-density $\phi (x)$ associated with $\tilde {w} $ may be used to construct a generalized exterior derivative that converts a p-form density to a (p+1)-form density of identical weight.
  It is argued that the scalar-density $\phi (x)$ associated with $\tilde {w}$ corresponds to an axion-like pseudo-scalar field in the Minkowski space-time, and that it can also masquerade as dark matter. Thereafter, we provide a simple semi-classical analysis in which a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate of such ultra-light pseudo-scalars leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole. A brief analysis of propagation of weak gravitational waves in the presence of $\tilde{w} $ is also considered in this article.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Vacuum of Spacetime with a Fundamental Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum theory of gravity implies a fine-grained structure of spacetime, which can be conveniently modeled as some form of pixelation at the Planck scale, with potentially observable consequences. In this work, we build upon previous results to investigate the effect of pixelation on the quantum vacuum, making use of the framework of Doubly Special Relativity (DSR). At the center of the DSR approach is an observer dependent length scale, defining the pixelation of spacetime. A key feature of quantum field theory in DSR is the dispersive nature of the vacuum state and the associated appearance of curvature in momentum space. As a result, the standard treatment of the renormalized stress-energy-momentum tensor acquires correction terms. As an illustration, we present here a calculation of the thermal vacuum and modified Casimir effect, using both modified propagators and momentum measures. We choose a consistent choice of momentum space metric that both generates the modified dispersion relations we use and preserves the Lorentz invariant character of the results obtained. Put together this constitutes a consistent calculation framework we can apply to other more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>The gravitational eikonal: from particle, string and brane collisions to black-hole encounters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by conceptual problems in quantum theories of gravity, the gravitational eikonal approach, inspired by its electromagnetic predecessor, has been successfully applied to the transplanckian energy collisions of elementary particles and strings since the late eighties, and to string-brane collisions in the past decade. After the direct detection of gravitational waves from black-hole mergers, most of the attention has shifted towards adapting these methods to the physics of black-hole encounters. For such systems, the eikonal exponentiation provides an amplitude-based approach to calculate classical gravitational observables, thus complementing more traditional analytic methods such as the Post-Newtonian expansion, the worldline formalism, or the Effective-One-Body approach. In this review we summarize the main ideas and techniques behind the gravitational eikonal formalism. We discuss how it can be applied in various different physical setups involving particles, strings and branes and then we mainly concentrate on the most recent developments, focusing on massive scalars minimally coupled to gravity, for which we aim at being as self-contained and comprehensive as possible.</description>

      <title>Polariton Fluids as Quantum Field Theory Simulators on Tailored Curved Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields in curved spacetime exhibit a wealth of effects like Hawking radiation from black holes. While quantum field theory in black holes can only be studied theoretically, it can be tested in controlled laboratory experiments. In experiments, a fluid going from sub- to supersonic speed creates an effectively curved spacetime for the acoustic field, with a horizon where the speed of the fluid equals the speed of sound. The challenge to test predictions like the Hawking effect in such systems lies in the control of the spacetime curvature and access to the field spectrum thereon. Here, we create tailored stationary effective curved spacetimes in a polaritonic quantum fluid of light in which either massless or massive excitations can be created, with smooth and steep horizons and various supersonic fluid speeds. Using a recently developed spectroscopy method we measure the spectrum of collective excitations on these spacetimes, crucially observing negative energy modes in the supersonic regions, which signals the formation of a horizon. Control over the horizon curvature and access to the spectrum on either side demonstrates the potential of quantum fluids of light for the study of field theories on curved spacetimes, and we discuss the possibility of investigating emission and spectral instabilities with a horizon or in an effective Exotic Compact Object configuration.</description>

      <title>Null Infinity as a Weakly Isolated Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Null infinity arises as a boundary of the Penrose conformal completion of an asymptotically flat physical space-time. We first note that null infinity is a weakly isolated horizon (WIH), and then show that its familiar properties can be derived from the general WIH framework. This seems quite surprising because physics associated with black hole (and cosmological) WIHs is very different from that extracted at null infinity. We show that these differences can be directly traced back to the fact that null infinity is a WIH in the conformal completion rather than the physical space-time. In particular, the BMS group at null infinity stems from the symmetry group of WIHs. In a companion paper, we obtain fluxes and charges associated with symmetries associated with both null infinity and black hole (and cosmological) horizons using a new Hamiltonian framework. The fact that is there is a single mathematical framework underlying these different situations paves the way to explore the relation between horizon dynamics in the strong field region and waveforms at infinity. It should also be useful in the analysis of black hole evaporation in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Tidal disruptions of stars on the equatorial plane orbiting Kerr black holes have been widely studied. However thus far, there have been fewer studies of stars in inclined precessing orbits around a Kerr black hole. In this paper, we use the tensor virial equations to show the presence of possible resonances in these systems for typical physical parameters of black hole-neutron star binaries in close orbits or of a white dwarf/an ordinary star orbiting a supermassive black hole. This suggests the presence of a new instability before the tidal disruption limit is encountered in such systems.</description>

      <title>Mono- and oligochromatic extreme-mass ratio inspirals</title>

Abstract: The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass object by a supermassive black hole represents a unique probe of warped spacetime. The small object, typically a stellar-mass black hole, describes a very large number of cycles before crossing the event horizon. Because of the mass difference, we call these captures extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Their merger event rate at the Galactic Centre is negligible, but the amount of time spent in the early inspiral is not. Early EMRIs (E-EMRIs) spend hundreds of thousands of years in band during this phase. At very early stages, the peak of the frequency will not change during an observational time. At later stages, it will change a bit and finally the EMRI explores a wide range of them when it is close to merger. We distinguish between "monocromatic" E-EMRIs, which do not change their (peak) frequency, oligochromatic E-EMRIs, which explore a short range and polychromatic ones, the EMRIs which have been discussed so far in the literature. We derive the number of E-EMRIs at the Galactic Centre, and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and perform a study of parameter extraction. We show that parameters such as the spin and the mass can be extracted with an error which can be as small as $10^{-11}$ and $10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. There are between hundreds and thousands of E-EMRIs in their monochromatic stage at the GC, and tens in their oligochromatic phase. The SNR ranges from a minimum of $10$ (larger likelihood) to a maximum of $10^6$ (smaller likelihood). Moreover, we derive the contribution signal corresponding to the incoherent sum of continuous with two representatives masses; $10\,M_{\odot}$ and $40\,M_{\odot}$ and show that their curves will cover a significant part of LISA's sensitivity curve. Depending on their level of circularisation, they might be detected as individual sources or form a foreground population.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>

      <title>Background information: a study on the sensitivity of astrophysical gravitational-wave background searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of gravitational-wave signals from stellar-mass compact binary mergers are too weak to be individually detected with present-day instruments and instead contribute to a faint, persistent background. This astrophysical background is targeted by searches that model the gravitational-wave ensemble collectively with a small set of parameters. The traditional search models the background as a stochastic field and estimates its amplitude by cross-correlating data from multiple interferometers. A different search uses gravitational-wave templates to marginalize over all individual event parameters and measure the duty cycle and population properties of binary mergers. Both searches ultimately estimate the total merger rate of compact binaries and are expected to yield a detection in the coming years. Given the conceptual and methodological differences between them, though, it is not well understood how their results should be mutually interpreted. In this paper, we use the Fisher information to study the implications of a background detection in terms of which region of the Universe each approach probes. Specifically, we quantify how information about the compact binary merger rate is accumulated by each search as a function of the event redshift. For the LIGO Design sensitivity and a uniform-in-comoving-volume distribution of equal-mass 30M_sol binaries, the traditional cross-correlation search obtains 99% of its information from binaries up to redshift 2.5 (average signal-to-noise-ratio &lt;8), and the template-based search from binaries up to redshift 1.0 (average signal-to-noise-ratio ~8). While we do not calculate the total information accumulated by each search, our analysis emphasizes the need to pair any claimed detection of the stochastic background with an assessment of which binaries contribute to said detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Dark Matter Around Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a massive scalar field dark matter scenarios in the large mass limit around a central Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature. This implies that the scalar cloud located at the center of galaxies may have survived untill present times.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Time-evolution of the Universe as described by the Friedmann equation can be coupled to equations of motion of matter fields. Quantum effects may be incorporated to improve these classical equations of motion by the renormalization group (RG) running of their couplings. Since temporal and thermal evolutions are linked to each other, astrophysical and cosmological treatements based on zero-temperature RG methods require the extension to finite-temperatures. We propose and explore a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units), where $k_T$ is acting as a running cutoff for thermal fluctuations and the momentum $k$ can be used for the quantum fluctuations. In this approach, the temperature of the expanding Universe is related to the dimensionless quantity $\tau$ (and not to $k_T$). We show that by this choice dimensionless RG flow equations have no explicit $k$-dependence, as it is convenient. We also discuss how this modified thermal RG is used to handle high-energy divergences of the RG running of the cosmological constant and to "solve the triviality"of the $\phi^4$ model by a thermal phase transition in terms of $\tau$ in $d=4$ Euclidean dimensions.</description>
