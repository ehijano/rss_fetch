      <title>Walks on tiled boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several articles deal with tilings with various shapes, and also a very frequent type of combinatorics is to examine the walks on graphs or on grids. We combine these two things and give the numbers of the shortest walks crossing the tiled $(1\times n)$ and $(2\times n)$ square grids by covering them with squares and dominoes. We describe these numbers not only recursively, but also as rational polynomial linear combinations of Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck polynomials of inverse fireworks permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipedreams are combinatorial objects that compute Grothendieck polynomials. We introduce a new combinatorial object that naturally recast the pipedream formula. From this, we obtain the first direct combinatorial formula for the top degree components of Grothendieck polynomials, also known as the Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials. We also prove the inverse fireworks case of a conjecture of M\'esz\'aros, Setiabrata, and St. Dizier on the support of Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <title>PackIt! Gamified Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles on an $n \times n$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in \emph{solitaire} fashion. On the $t$-th turn, a rectangle of area $t$ or $t+1$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant is to perfectly pack the $n \times n$ grid. We analyze conditions for the existence of a perfect packing over $n \times n$, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games of PackIt! up to $n = 50$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.</description>

      <title>A 2-distance $(2\Delta+7)$-coloring of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is called a $2$-distance coloring if any two vertices at a distance at most $2$ from each other receive different colors. Recently, Bousquet et al. (Discrete Mathematics, 346(4), 113288, 2023) proved that $2\Delta+7$ colors are sufficient for the $2$-distance coloring of planar graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 9$. In this paper, we strengthen their result by removing the maximum degree constraint and show that all planar graphs admit a 2-distance $(2\Delta+7)$-coloring.This particularly improves the result of Van den Heuvel and McGuinness (Journal of Graph Theory, 42(2), 110-124, 2003).</description>

      <title>Treewidth of generalized Hamming graph, bipartite Kneser graph and generalized Petersen graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t,q$ and $n$ be positive integers. Write $[q] = \{1,2,\ldots,q\}$. The generalized Hamming graph $H(t,q,n)$ is the graph whose vertex set is the cartesian product of $n$ copies of $[q]$$(q\ge 2)$, where two vertices are adjacent if their Hamming distance is at most $t$. In particular, $H(1,q,n)$ is the well-known Hamming graph and $H(1,2,n)$ is the hypercube. In 2006, Chandran and Kavitha described the asymptotic value of $tw(H(1,q,n))$, where $tw(G)$ denotes the treewidth of $G$. In this paper, we give the exact pathwidth of $H(t,2,n)$ and show that $tw(H(t,q,n)) = \Theta(tq^n/\sqrt{n})$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Based on those results, we show that the treewidth of bipartite Kneser graph $BK(n,k)$ is $\binom{n}{k} - 1$ when $n$ is sufficient large relative to $k$ and the bounds of $tw(BK(2k+1,k))$ are given. Moreover, we present the bounds of the treewidth of generalized Petersen graph.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two variations of the Gyarfas--Lehel conjecture on the minimum number of monochromatic components needed to cover an edge-coloured complete bipartite graph. Specifically, we show the following.   - For p&gt;&gt; (\log n/n)^{1/2}, w.h.p.~every  2-colouring of the random bipartite graph G~ G(n,n,p) admits a cover of all but O(1/p) vertices of G using at most three vertex-disjoint monochromatic components.   - For every 2-colouring of a bipartite graph G with parts of size n and minimum degree (13/16+o(1))n, the vertices of G can be covered using at most three vertex-disjoint monochromatic components.</description>

      <title>Spanning Euler Tours in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by generalizations of de Bruijn cycles to various combinatorial structures (Chung, Diaconis, and Graham), we study various Euler tours in set systems. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a hypergraph whose corank and rank are $c\geq 3$ and $k$, respetively. The minimum $t$-degree of $\mathcal{G}$ is the fewest number of edges containing every $t$-subset of vertices. An Euler tour (family, respectively) in $\mathcal{G}$ is a (family of, respectively) closed walk(s) that (jointly, respectively) traverses each edge of $\mathcal{G}$ exactly once. An Euler tour is spanning if it traverses all the vertices of $\mathcal{G}$. We show that $\mathcal{G}$ has an Euler family if its incidence graph is $(1+\lceil k/c \rceil)$-edge-connected. Provided that the number of vertices of $\mathcal{G}$ meets a reasonable lower bound, and either $2$-degree is at least $k$ or $t$-degree is at least one for $t\geq 3$, we show that $\mathcal{G}$ has a spanning Euler tour. To exhibit the usefulness of our results, we solve a number of open problems concerning ordering blocks of a design (these have applications in other fields such as erasure-correcting codes). Answering a question of Horan and Hurlbert, we show that a Steiner quadruple system of order $n$ has a (spanning) Euler tour if and only if $n\geq 8$ and $n\equiv 2,4 \pmod 6$, and we prove a similar result for all Steiner systems, as well as all designs except for 2-designs whose index $\lambda$ is less than the largest block size. We nearly solve a conjecture of Dewar and Stevens on the existence of universal cycles in pairwise balanced designs. Motivated by R.L. Graham's question on the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in block-intersection graphs of Steiner triple systems, we establish the Hamiltonicity of the block-intersection graph of a large family of (not necessarily uniform) designs. All our results are constructive and of polynomial time complexity.</description>

      <title>2-balanced sequences coding rectangle exchange transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new class of ternary sequences that are 2-balanced. These sequences are obtained by colouring of Sturmian sequences. We show that the class contains sequences of any given letter frequencies. We provide an upper bound on factor and abelian complexity of these sequences. Using the interpretation by rectangle exchange transformation, we prove that for almost all triples of letter frequencies, the upper bound on factor and abelian complexity is reached. The bound on factor complexity is given using a number-theoretical function which we compute explicitly for a class of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper showed how to find sets of finite affine or projective planes constructed on a common set of points, so that lines of one plane meet lines of a different plane in at most two points. In this paper, those results are generalized in two different ways to spaces of higher dimension. The simpler of the two generalizations admits many solutions, both affine and projective. For the stronger definition, where a line of one space must be an arc in the other, we show the existence of pairs of projective spaces of dimension one less than a prime.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ramsey--Tur\'an density for cliques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized Ramsey--Tur\'an function $\mathrm{RT}(n,K_s,K_t,o(n))$, which is the maximum possible number of copies of $K_s$ in an $n$-vertex $K_t$-free graph with independence number $o(n)$. The case when $s=2$ was settled by Erd{\H{o}}s, S{\'o}s, Bollob{\'a}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di in the 1980s. We combinatorially resolve the general case for all $s\ge 3$, showing that the (asymptotic) extremal graphs for this problem have simple (bounded) structures. In particular, it implies that the extremal structures follow a periodic pattern when $t$ is much larger than $s$. Our results disprove a conjecture of Balogh, Liu, and Sharifzadeh and show that a relaxed version does hold.</description>

      <title>Edge-Disjoint Spanning Trees on Star-Product Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-product graphs are a natural extension of the Cartesian product, but have not been well-studied. We show that many important established and emerging network topologies, including HyperX, SlimFly, BundleFly, PolarStar, mesh, and torus, are in fact star-product graphs. While this connection was known for BundleFly and PolarStar, it was not for the others listed.
  We extend a method of constructing maximal and near-maximal sets of edge-disjoint spanning trees on Cartesian products to the star product, thus obtain maximal or near-maximal sets of edge-disjoint spanning trees on new networks of importance, where such sets can improve bandwidth of collective operations and therefore accelerate many important workloads in high-performance computing.</description>

Abstract: We have established a coherent framework for applying variational methods to partial differential equations on hypergraphs, which includes the propositions of calculus and function spaces on hypergraphs. Several results related to the maximum principle on hypergraphs have also been proven. As applications, we demonstrated how these can be used to study partial differential equations on hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Relations between Chebyshev, Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials via trigonometric sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive some new identities involving the Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials and the Chebyshev polynomials of the first and the second kind. Our starting point is a finite trigonometric sum which equals the resolvent kernel on the discrete circle with $m$ vertices and which can be evaluated in two different ways. An expression for this sum in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials was deduced in \cite{JKS} and the expression in terms of the Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials is deduced in this paper. As a consequence, we establish some further identities involving trigonometric sums and Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell and Pell-Lucas polynomials and numbers, thus providing a "physical" interpretation for those identities. Moreover, the finite trigonometric sum of the type considered in this paper can be related to the effective resistance between any two vertices of the $N$-cycle graph with four nearest neighbors $C_{N}(1,2)$. This yields further identities involving Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) dimension is a standard measure in descriptive complexity theory for the structural complexity of a graph. We prove that the WL-dimension of a graph on $n$ vertices is at most $3/20 \cdot n + o(n)= 0.15 \cdot n + o(n)$. The proof develops various techniques to analyze the structure of coherent configurations.
  This includes sufficient conditions under which a fiber can be restored up to isomorphism if it is removed, a recursive proof exploiting a degree reduction and treewidth bounds, as well as an analysis of interspaces involving small fibers.
  As a base case, we also analyze the dimension of coherent configurations with small fiber size and thereby graphs with small color class size.</description>

      <title>Exact and Heuristic Computation of the Scanwidth of Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To measure the tree-likeness of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a new width parameter that considers the directions of the arcs was recently introduced: scanwidth. We present the first algorithm that efficiently computes the exact scanwidth of general DAGs. For DAGs with one root and scanwidth $k$ it runs in $O(k \cdot n^k \cdot m)$ time. The algorithm also functions as an FPT algorithm with complexity $O(2^{4 \ell - 1} \cdot \ell \cdot n + n^2)$ for phylogenetic networks of level-$\ell$, a type of DAG used to depict evolutionary relationships among species. Our algorithm performs well in practice, being able to compute the scanwidth of synthetic networks up to 30 reticulations and 100 leaves within 500 seconds. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic that obtains an average practical approximation ratio of 1.5 on these networks. While we prove that the scanwidth is bounded from below by the treewidth of the underlying undirected graph, experiments suggest that for networks the parameters are close in practice.</description>

Abstract: We study the $k$-th nearest neighbor distance function from a finite point-set in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We provide a Morse theoretic framework to analyze the sub-level set topology. In particular, we present a simple combinatorial-geometric characterization for critical points and their indices, along with detailed information about the possible changes in homology at the critical levels. We conclude by computing the expected number of critical points for a homogeneous Poisson process. Our results deliver significant insights and tools for the analysis of persistent homology in order-$k$ Delaunay mosaics, and random $k$-fold coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Which surfaces can be realized with two-dimensional faces of the five-dimensional cube (the penteract)? How can we visualize them? In recent work, Aveni, Govc, and Roldan, show that there exist 2690 connected closed cubical surfaces up to isomorphism in the 5-cube. They give a classification in terms of their genus $g$ for closed orientable cubical surfaces and their demigenus $k$ for a closed non-orientable cubical surface. In this paper, we explain the main idea behind the exhaustive search and we visualize the projection to $\mathbb{R}^3$ of a torus, a genus two torus, the projective plane, and the Klein bottle. We use reinforcement learning techniques to obtain configurations optimized for 3D printing.</description>

      <title>Plane Hamiltonian Cycles in Convex Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Rafla from 1988 asserts that every simple drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ admits a plane Hamiltonian cycle. It turned out that already the existence of much simpler non-crossing substructures in such drawings is hard to prove. Recent progress was made by Aichholzer et al. and by Suk and Zeng who proved the existence of a plane path of length $\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$ and of a plane matching of size $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ in every simple drawing of $K_{n}$.
  Instead of studying simpler substructures, we prove Rafla's conjecture for the subclass of convex drawings, the most general class in the convexity hierarchy introduced by Arroyo et al. Moreover, we show that every convex drawing of $K_n$ contains a plane Hamiltonian path between each pair of vertices (Hamiltonian connectivity) and a plane $k$-cycle for each $3 \leq k \leq n$ (pancyclicity), and present further results on maximal plane subdrawings.</description>

      <title>Tournaments and random walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between tournaments and random walks. This connection was observed by Moser, who conjectured that the number of score sequences $S_n\sim C4^n/n^{5/2}$. Winston and Kleitman came close to finding the correct order of $S_n$. Building on this, and subsequent works by Tak\'acs, Kim and Pittel confirmed that $S_n=\Theta(4^n/n^{5/2})$.
  In this work, we verify Moser's conjecture, using limit theory for integrated random walk bridges. Moreover, we show that $C$ can be described in terms of random walks. Combining this with a recent proof and alternative, number-theoretic description of $C$ by the second author, we obtain an analogue of Louchard's formula, for the Laplace transform of the squared Brownian excursion/Airy area measure. Finally, we describe the scaling limit of random score sequences, in terms of the Kolmogorov excursions, studied recently by B\"{a}r, Duraj and Wachtel.
  Our results can also be interpreted as answering questions related to a class of random polymers, which began with influential work of Sina\u{i}. From this point of view, our methods yield the precise asymptotics for a persistence probability, related to the pinning/wetting models from statistical physics, that was estimated up to constants by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, as conjectured by Caravenna and Deuschel.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of random polymers, introduced by Sina\u{\i}, which are related to persistence probabilities in integrated simple random walk bridges. We find the precise asymptotics of these probabilities, and describe their combinatorics, using limit theory for infinitely divisible distributions, and the number-theoretic subset counting formulas of von Sterneck from the early 1900s. Our results sharpen estimates by Aurzada, Dereich and Lifshits, and respond to a conjecture of Caravenna and Deuschel, which arose in their study of the pinning/wetting models, for random linear chains exhibiting entropic repulsion. Our key combinatorial result is an analogue of Sparre Andersen's classical formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1501.02437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $1$-extendible if every edge belongs to at least one $1$-factor of $G$. Let $G$ be a graph with a $1$-factor $F$. Then an even $F$-orientation of $G$ is an orientation in which each $F$-alternating cycle has exactly an even number of edges directed in the same fixed direction around the cycle. In this paper, we examine the structure of 1-extendible graphs $G$ which have no even $F$-orientation where $F$ is a fixed $1$-factor of $G$. In the case of graphs of connectivity at least four and k-regular graphs for $k \geq 3$ we give a complete characterization.</description>

      <title>Rainbow saturation for complete graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call an edge-colored graph rainbow if all of its edges receive distinct colors. An edge-colored graph $\Gamma$ is called $H$-rainbow saturated if $\Gamma$ does not contain a rainbow copy of $H$ and adding an edge of any color to $\Gamma$ creates a rainbow copy of $H$. The rainbow saturation number $sat(n,{R}(H))$ is the minimum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $H$-rainbow saturated graph. Gir\~{a}o, Lewis, and Popielarz conjectured that $sat(n,{R}(K_r))=2(r-2)n+O(1)$ for fixed $r\geq 3$. Disproving this conjecture, we establish that for every $r\geq 3$, there exists a constant $\alpha_r$ such that $$r + \Omega\left(r^{1/3}\right) \le \alpha_r \le r + r^{1/2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad sat(n,{R}(K_r)) = \alpha_r n + O(1).$$ Recently, Behague, Johnston, Letzter, Morrison, and Ogden independently gave a slightly weaker upper bound which was sufficient to disprove the conjecture. They also introduced the weak rainbow saturation number, and asked whether this is equal to the rainbow saturation number of $K_r$, since the standard weak saturation number of complete graphs equals the standard saturation number. Surprisingly, our lower bound separates the rainbow saturation number from the weak rainbow saturation number, answering this question in the negative. The existence of the constant $\alpha_r$ resolves another of their questions in the affirmative for complete graphs. Furthermore, we show that the conjecture of Gir\~{a}o, Lewis, and Popielarz is true if we have an additional assumption that the edge-colored $K_r$-rainbow saturated graph must be rainbow. As an ingredient of the proof, we study graphs which are $K_r$-saturated with respect to the operation of deleting one edge and adding two edges.</description>

      <title>Reduced clique graphs: a correction to "Chordal graphs and their clique graphs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galinier, Habib, and Paul introduced the reduced clique graph of a chordal graph $G$. The nodes of the reduced clique graph are the maximal cliques of $G$, and two nodes are joined by an edge if and only if they form a non-disjoint separating pair of cliques in $G$. In this case the weight of the edge is the size of the intersection of the two cliques. A clique tree of $G$ is a tree with the maximal cliques of $G$ as its nodes, where for any $v\in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by the nodes containing $v$ is connected. Galinier et al.\ prove that a spanning tree of the reduced clique graph is a clique tree if and only if it has maximum weight, but their proof contains an error. We explain and correct this error.
  In addition, we initiate a study of the structure of reduced clique graphs by proving that they cannot contain any induced cycle of length five (although they may contain induced cycles of length three or any even integer greater than two). We show that no cycle of length four or more is isomorphic to a reduced clique graph. We prove that the class of clique graphs of chordal graphs is not comparable to the class of reduced clique graphs of chordal graphs by providing examples that are in each of these classes without being in the other.</description>

      <title>Proving the existence of Euclidean knight's tours on $n \times n \times \cdots \times n$ chessboards for $n &lt; 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Knight's Tour problem consists of finding a Hamiltonian path for the knight on a given set of points so that the knight can visit exactly once every vertex of the mentioned set. In the present paper, we provide a $5$-dimensional alternative to the well-known statement that it is not ever possible for a knight to visit once every vertex of $C(3,k) := \{0,1,2\}^k$ by performing a sequence of $3^k-1$ jumps of standard length, since the most accurate answer to the original question actually depends on which mathematical assumptions we are making at the beginning of the game, when we decide to extend a planar chess piece to the third dimension and above. Our counterintuitive outcome follows from the observation that we can alternatively define a $2$D knight as a piece that moves from one square to another on the chessboard by covering a fixed Euclidean distance of $\sqrt{5}$ so that also the statement of Theorem~3 in [Erde, J., Gol{\'e}nia, B., \&amp; Gol{\'e}nia, S. (2012), The closed knight tour problem in higher dimensions, The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 19(4), \#P9] does not hold anymore for such a Euclidean knight, as long as a $2 \times 2 \times \cdots \times 2$ chessboard with at least $2^6$ cells is given. Moreover, we show a classical closed knight's tour on $C(3,4)-\{(1,1,1,1)\}$ whose arrival is at a distance of $2$ from $(1,1,1,1)$, and we finally construct closed Euclidean knight's tours on $\{0,1\}^k$ for each integer $k \geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Variants of spectral Tur\'an theorems and eigenvectors of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2002, Nikiforov proved that for an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with clique number $\omega$ and edge number $m$, the spectral radius $\lambda(G)$ satisfies $\lambda (G) \leq \sqrt{2(1 - 1/\omega) m}$, which confirmed a conjecture implicitly suggested by Edwards and Elphick. In this paper, we prove a local version of spectral Tur\'an inequality, which states that $\lambda^2(G)\leq 2\sum_{e\in E(G)}\frac{c(e)-1}{c(e)}$, where $c(e)$ is the order of the largest clique containing the edge $e$ in $G$. We also characterize the extremal graphs. We prove that our theorem implies Nikiforov's theorem and give an example to show that the difference of Nikiforov's bound and ours is $\Omega (\sqrt{m})$ for some cases. Additionally, we establish a spectral counterpart to Ore's problem (1962) which asks for the maximum size of an $n$-vertex graph such that its complement is connected and does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Our result leads to a new spectral Tur\'an inequality applicable to graphs with connected complements. Finally, we disprove a conjecture of Gregory, asserting that for a connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with chromatic number $k\geq 2$ and an independent set $S$, we have \[ \sum_{v\in S} x_v^2 \leq \frac{1}{2} - \frac{k-2}{2\sqrt{(k-2)^2 + 4(k-1)(n-k+1)}}, \] where $x_v$ is the component of the Perron vector of $G$ with respect to the vertex $v$. A modified version of Gregory's conjecture is proposed.</description>

We then state three infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the three infinite families.</description>

      <title>On an $n$-ary generalization of the Lie representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our study, initiated in our prior work with Richard Stanley, of the representation of the symmetric group on the multilinear component of an $n$-ary generalization of the free Lie algebra known as the free Fillipov $n$-algebra with $k$ brackets. Our ultimate aim is to determine the multiplicities of the irreducible representations in this representation. This had been done for the ordinary Lie representation ($n=2$ case) by Kraskiewicz and Weyman. The $k=2$ case was handled in our prior work, where the representation was shown to be isomorphic to $S^{2^{n-1}1}$. In this paper, for general $n$ and $k$, we obtain decomposition results that enable us to prove that in the $k=3$ case, the representation is isomorphic to $S^{3^{n-1}1} \oplus S^{3^{n-2}21^2}$.</description>

      <title>On sampling symmetric Gibbs distributions on sparse random graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce efficient algorithms for approximate sampling from symmetric Gibbs distributions on the sparse random (hyper)graph. The examples we consider include (but are not restricted to) important distributions on spin systems and spin-glasses such as the q state antiferromagnetic Potts model for $q\geq 2$, including the colourings, the uniform distributions over the Not-All-Equal solutions of random k-CNF formulas. Finally, we present an algorithm for sampling from the spin-glass distribution called the k-spin model. To our knowledge this is the first, rigorously analysed, efficient algorithm for spin-glasses which operates in a non trivial range of the parameters.
  Our approach builds on the one that was introduced in [Efthymiou: SODA 2012]. For a symmetric Gibbs distribution $\mu$ on a random (hyper)graph whose parameters are within an certain range, our algorithm has the following properties: with probability $1-o(1)$ over the input instances, it generates a configuration which is distributed within total variation distance $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from $\mu$. The time complexity is $O((n\log n)^2)$.
  The algorithm requires a range of the parameters which, for the graph case, coincide with the tree-uniqueness region, parametrised w.r.t. the expected degree d. For the hypergraph case, where uniqueness is less restrictive, we go beyond uniqueness. Our approach utilises in a novel way the notion of contiguity between Gibbs distributions and the so-called teacher-student model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the distributional Twenty Questions game, Bob chooses a number $x$ from $1$ to $n$ according to a distribution $\mu$, and Alice (who knows $\mu$) attempts to identify $x$ using Yes/No questions, which Bob answers truthfully. Her goal is to minimize the expected number of questions.
  The optimal strategy for the Twenty Questions game corresponds to a Huffman code for $\mu$, yet this strategy could potentially uses all $2^n$ possible questions. Dagan et al. constructed a set of $1.25^{n+o(n)}$ questions which suffice to construct an optimal strategy for all $\mu$, and showed that this number is optimal (up to sub-exponential factors) for infinitely many $n$.
  We determine the optimal size of such a set of questions for all $n$ (up to sub-exponential factors), answering an open question of Dagan et al. In addition, we generalize the results of Dagan et al. to the $d$-ary setting, obtaining similar results with $1.25$ replaced by $1 + (d-1)/d^{d/(d-1)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15226v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cluster algebraic generalization of Thurston's earthquake map for the cluster algebras of finite type, which we call the \emph{cluster earthquake map}. It is defined by gluing exponential maps, which is modeled after the earthquakes along ideal arcs. We prove an analogue of the earthquake theorem, which states that the cluster earthquake map gives a homeomorphism between the spaces of $\mathbb{R}^\mathrm{trop}$- and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$-valued points of the cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety. For those of type $A_n$ and $D_n$, the cluster earthquake map indeed recovers the earthquake maps for marked disks and once-punctured marked disks, respectively. Moreover, we investigate certain asymptotic behaviors of the cluster earthquake map, which give rise to "continuous deformations" of the Fock--Goncharov fan.</description>

Abstract: Given $k \leq 6$ points $(x_i,y_i) \in \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2$, we characterize rank deficiency of the $k \times 9$ matrix $Z_k$ with rows $x_i^\top \otimes y_i^\top$ in terms of the geometry of the point configurations $\{x_i\}$ and $\{y_i\}$. While this question comes from computer vision the answer relies on tools from classical algebraic geometry: For $k \leq 5$, the geometry of the rank-drop locus is characterized by cross-ratios and basic (projective) geometry of point configurations. For the case $k=6$ the rank-drop locus is captured by the classical theory of cubic surfaces.</description>

This problem arises in the conditioning of certain well-known reconstruction algorithms in computer vision, but has surprising connections to classical algebraic geometry via the interplay of quadric surfaces, cubic curves and Cremona transformations. The characterization of rank deficiency of $Z_k$, when $k \leq 6$, was completed in arXiv:2301.09826.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Degenerate Simplex Pivots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplex algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms to solve linear programs (LPs). Starting at an extreme point solution of an LP, it performs a sequence of basis exchanges (called pivots) that allows one to move to a better extreme point along an improving edge-direction of the underlying polyhedron. A key issue in the simplex algorithm's performance is degeneracy, which may lead to a (potentially long) sequence of basis exchanges which do not change the current extreme point solution. In this paper, we prove that it is always possible to limit the number of consecutive degenerate pivots that the simplex algorithm performs to $n-m-1$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of equality constraints of a given LP in standard equality form.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the maximum parsimony tree for data with few substitutions within the NNI neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating species relationship trees, so-called phylogenetic trees, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated).
  On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present manuscript to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt; \frac{n}{8}+\frac{6}{5}-\frac{1}{10} \sqrt{\frac{5}{16} n^2+4}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;8 k-\frac{46}{5}+\frac{2}{5} \sqrt{40 k-31} $), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on a given tree $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of integer programming and the $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{VNumber}$.</description>

      <title>A survey on conjugacy class graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several graphs defined on groups. Among them we consider graphs whose vertex set consists conjugacy classes of a group $G$ and adjacency is defined by properties of the elements of conjugacy classes. In particular, we consider commuting/nilpotent/solvable conjugacy class graph of $G$ where two distinct conjugacy classes $a^G$ and $b^G$ are adjacent if there exist some elements $x\in a^G$ and $y\in b^G$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle$ is abelian/nilpotent/solvable. After a section of introductory results and examples, we discuss all the available results on connectedness, graph realization, genus, various spectra and energies of certain induced subgraphs of these graphs. Proofs of the results are not included. However, many open problems for further investigation are stated.</description>
