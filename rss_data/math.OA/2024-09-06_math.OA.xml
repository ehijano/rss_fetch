      <title>The strong Haagerup inequality for q-circular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first author and Speicher proved the inequality for operator norms of holomorphic homogeneous polynomials in freely independent $\mathscr{R}$-diagonal elements, which improves the bound obtained by Haagerup. We prove a similar inequality for $q$-circular systems, which are neither freely independent nor $\mathscr{R}$-diagonal.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative branched covers and bundle unitarizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that (a) the sections space of a continuous unital subhomogeneous $C^*$ bundle over compact metrizable $X$ admits a finite-index expectation onto $C(X)$, answering a question of Blanchard-Gogi\'{c} (in the metrizable case); (b) such expectations cannot, generally, have ``optimal index'', answering negatively a variant of the same question; and (c) a homogeneous continuous Banach bundle over a locally paracompact base space $X$ can be renormed into a Hilbert bundle in such a manner that the original space of bounded sections is $C_b(X)$-linearly Banach-Mazur-close to the resulting Hilbert module over the algebra $C_b(X)$ of continuous bounded functions on $X$. This last result resolves quantitatively another problem posed by Gogi\'{c}.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint traces on the Pedersen ideal of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to circumvent a fundamental issue when studying densely defined traces on $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras -- which we refer to as the Trace Question -- we initiate a systematic study of the set $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ of self-adjoint traces on the Pedersen ideal of $A$.
  The set $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ is a topological vector space with a vector lattice structure, which in the unital setting reflects the Choquet simplex structure of the tracial states. We establish a form of Kadison duality for $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ and compute $T_{\mathbb R}(A)$ for principal twisted \'etale groupoid $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. We also answer the Trace Question positively for a large class of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Limit of iteration of the induced Aluthge transformations of centered operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluthge transform is a well-known mapping defined on bounded linear operators. Especially, the convergence property of its iteration has been studied by many authors. In this paper, we discuss the problem for the induced Aluthge transforms which is a generalization of the Aluthge transform defined in 2021. We give the polar decomposition of the induced Aluthge transformations of centered operators and show its iteration converges to a normal operator. In particular, if $T$ is an invertible centered matrix, then iteration of any induced Aluthge transformations converges. Using the canonical standard form of matrix algebras we show that the iteration of any induced Aluthge transformations with respect to the weighted arithmetic mean and the power mean converge. Those observation are extended to the $C^*$-algebra of compact operators on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and as an application we show the stability of $\mathcal{AN}$ and $\mathcal{AM}$ properties under the iteration of the induced Aluthge transformations. We also provide concrete forms of their limit points for centered matrices and several examples. Moreover, we discuss the limit point of the induced Aluthge transformation with respect to the power mean in the injective $II_1$-factor $\mathcal{M}$ and determine the form of its limit for some centered operators in $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

      <title>Fully noncentral Lie ideals and invariant additive subgroups in rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove conditions ensuring that a Lie ideal or an invariant additive subgroup in a ring contains all additive commutators. A crucial assumption is that the subgroup is fully noncentral, that is, its image in every quotient is noncentral.
  For a unital algebra over a field of characteristic $\neq 2$ where every additive commutator is a sum of square-zero elements, we show that a fully noncentral subspace is a Lie ideal if and only if it is invariant under all inner automorphisms. This applies in particular to zero-product balanced algebras.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic freeness of Haar unitaries in quasi-exponential dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove almost sure strong asymptotic freeness of i.i.d. random unitaries with the following law: sample a Haar unitary matrix of dimension $n$ and then send this unitary into an irreducible representation of $U(n)$. The strong convergence holds as long as the irreducible representation arises from a pair of partitions of total size at most $n^{\frac{1}{24}-\varepsilon}$ and is uniform in this regime.
  Previously this was known for partitions of total size up to $\asymp\log n/\log\log n$ by a result of Bordenave and Collins.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, partially using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights given by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, these constraints are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix of parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). A simple example of this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out.</description>

      <title>Differential embeddings into algebras of topological stable rank 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a class of smooth Banach *-algebras that are differential subalgebras of commutative C*-algebras whose openness of multiplication is completely determined by the topological stable rank of the target C*-algebra. We then show that group algebras of Abelian groups of unbounded exponent fail to have uniformly open convolution. Finally, we completely characterise in the complex case (uniform) openness of multiplication in algebras of continuous functions in terms of the covering dimension.</description>

      <title>Convolution algebras of double groupoids and strict 2-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double groupoids are a type of higher groupoid structure that can arise when one has two distinct groupoid products on the same set of arrows. A particularly important example of such structures is the irrational torus and, more generally, strict 2-groups. Groupoid structures give rise to convolution operations on the space of arrows. Therefore, a double groupoid comes equipped with two product operations on the space of functions. In this article we investigate in what sense these two convolution operations are compatible. We use the representation theory of compact Lie groups to get insight into a certain class of 2-groups.</description>

      <title>Exotic groupoid $C^*$-algebras associated to double groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11297v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of partial action groupoids called double groupoids which are constructed from pairs of subgroups satisfying similar conditions to those of a matched pair of groups. If the double groupoid is \'etale, then we show that whenever the partially acting group admit exotic ideal completions in the sense of Brown and Guentner, the corresponding double groupoid also admit exotic $C^*$-completions.</description>

      <title>On closure operations in the space of subgroups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish some interactions between uniformly recurrent subgroups (URSs) of a group $G$ and cosets topologies $\tau_\mathcal{N}$ on $G$ associated to a family $\mathcal{N}$ of normal subgroups of $G$. We show that when $\mathcal{N}$ consists of finite index subgroups of $G$, there is a natural closure operation $\mathcal{H} \mapsto \mathrm{cl}_\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{H})$ that associates to a URS $\mathcal{H}$ another URS $\mathrm{cl}_\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{H})$, called the $\tau_\mathcal{N}$-closure of $\mathcal{H}$. We give a characterization of the URSs $\mathcal{H}$ that are $\tau_\mathcal{N}$-closed in terms of stabilizer URSs. This has consequences on arbitrary URSs when $G$ belongs to the class of groups for which every faithful minimal profinite action is topologically free. We also consider the largest amenable URS $\mathcal{A}_G$, and prove that for certain coset topologies on $G$, almost all subgroups $H \in \mathcal{A}_G$ have the same closure. For groups in which amenability is detected by a set of laws (a property that is variant of the Tits alternative), we deduce a criterion for $\mathcal{A}_G$ to be a singleton based on residual properties of $G$.</description>
