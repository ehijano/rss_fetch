      <title>Optimal dividends for a NatCat insurer in the presence of a climate tipping point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal dividend strategies for an insurance company facing natural catastrophe claims, anticipating the arrival of a climate tipping point after which the claim intensity and/or the claim size distribution of the underlying risks deteriorates irreversibly. Extending earlier literature based on a shot-noise Cox process assumption for claim arrivals, we show that the non-stationary feature of such a tipping point can, in fact, be an advantage for shareholders seeking to maximize expected discounted dividends over the lifetime of the portfolio. Assuming the tipping point arrives according to an Erlang distribution, we demonstrate that the corresponding system of two-dimensional stochastic control problems admits a viscosity solution, which can be numerically approximated using a discretization of the current surplus and the claim intensity level. We also prove uniform convergence of this discrete solution to that of the original continuous problem. The results are illustrated through several numerical examples, and the sensitivity of the optimal dividend strategies to the presence of a climate tipping point is analyzed. In all these examples, it turns out that when the insurance premium is adjusted fairly at the moment of the tipping point, and all quantities are observable, the non-stationarity introduced by the tipping point can, in fact, represent an upward potential for shareholders.</description>

      <title>Climate Physical Risk Assessment in Asset Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate-related phenomena are increasingly affecting regions worldwide, manifesting as floods, water scarcity, and heat waves, which can significantly impair companies' assets and productivity. We develop a framework, based on the Vasicek model for credit risk, that introduces downward jumps due to climate phenomena in a company asset's dynamics. These negative shocks are designed to mirror the negative effect of extreme climate events. We explore various possibilities for the distribution of jumps and provide a comprehensive characterization of the model and its calibration process that relies on companies' asset intensity and geographical exposure. We utilize this new multivariate firm value model framework with jumps to understand the influence of climate related extreme events on different portfolios' expected and unexpected losses. The results suggest introducing additional safe capital to offset the losses resulting from physical climate risks, particularly for high asset intensity sectors.</description>

      <title>Analyzing distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for unimodal and symmetric distributions under partial information constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the lower and upper bounds of worst-case distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for unimodal, and symmetric unimodal distributions when mean and variance information are available. We also consider the sharp upper bounds of distortion riskmetrics and weighted entropy for symmetric distribution under known mean and variance. These results are applied to (weighted) entropies, shortfalls and other risk measures. Specifically, entropies include cumulative Tsallis past entropy, cumulative residual Tsallis entropy of order {\alpha}, extended Gini coefficient, fractional generalized cumulative residual entropy, and fractional generalized cumulative entropy. Shortfalls include extended Gini shortfall, Gini shortfall, shortfall of cumulative residual entropy, and shortfall of cumulative residual Tsallis entropy. Other risk measures include nth-order expected shortfall, dual power principle and proportional hazard principle.</description>
