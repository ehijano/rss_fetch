      <title>Optimal Transmission Sequence Design with ISI Matching in Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) offers a groundbreaking approach to communication inspired by biological signaling. It is particularly suited for environments where traditional electromagnetic methods fail, such as fluid mediums or within the human body. This study focuses on addressing a major challenge in MC systems: inter symbol interference (ISI), which arises due to the random, diffusive propagation of molecules. We propose a novel technique that leverages transmission shaping to mitigate ISI effectively by designing optimal transmission pulse (or sequence) for symbols. Our approach centers on solving a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize the separability of individual symbol's responses within the symbol duration while matching the interference caused by molecular spillover for all symbols. By making ISI of each symbol similar, the approach reduces the effect of previous symbols and thus not require any adaptive computations. We introduce a geometric analogy involving two families of ellipses to derive the optimal solution. Analytical insights are supported by numerical simulations to design optimized transmission profiles to enhance the resilience toward ISI. The proposed transmission shaping method is evaluated through symbol error rate (SER). These results mark a significant step forward in developing robust and efficient MC systems, opening doors to advanced applications in bio-inspired and nano-scale communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Parameter Invariance Analysis of Moment Equations Using Dulmage-Mendelsohn Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living organisms maintain stable functioning amid environmental fluctuations through homeostasis, a mechanism that preserves a system's behavior despite changes in environmental conditions. To elucidate homeostasis in stochastic biochemical reactions, theoretical tools for assessing population-level invariance under parameter perturbations are crucial. In this paper, we propose a systematic method for identifying the stationary moments that remain invariant under parameter perturbations by leveraging the structural properties of the stationary moment equations. A key step in this development is addressing the underdetermined nature of moment equations, which has traditionally made it difficult to characterize how stationary moments depend on system parameters. To overcome this, we utilize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn (DM) decomposition of the coefficient matrix to extract welldetermined subequations and reveal their hierarchical structure. Leveraging this structure, we identify stationary moments whose partial derivatives with respect to parameters are structurally zero, facilitating the exploration of fundamental constraints that govern homeostatic behavior in stochastic biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inference of Asynchronous Boolean Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often derived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections and uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a phenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central importance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough will not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed models suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the data. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness and thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an algorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data that finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given dataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling of asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network nodes. In addition, we present a new method for pseudo-time assignment for single-cell RNA sequencing data that is derived from the modeling procedure. Our approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for time-series datasets, where asynchronicity often occurs. We demonstrate our methodology by integrating real data from transcriptomics experiments. These results significantly expand the applicability of the Boolean network model to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Entropic Matching for Expectation Propagation of Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, tractable latent state inference scheme for Markov jump processes, for which exact inference is often intractable. Our approach is based on an entropic matching framework that can be embedded into the well-known expectation propagation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by providing closed-form results for a simple family of approximate distributions and apply it to the general class of chemical reaction networks, which are a crucial tool for modeling in systems biology. Moreover, we derive closed-form expressions for point estimation of the underlying parameters using an approximate expectation maximization procedure. We evaluate our method across various chemical reaction networks and compare it to multiple baseline approaches, demonstrating superior performance in approximating the mean of the posterior process. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our method and potential avenues for future improvement, highlighting its promising direction for addressing complex continuous-time Bayesian inference problems.</description>
