      <title>On zero-order consistency residue and background pressure for the conservative SPH fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the major challenges for the conservative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, the zero-order consistency issue, although thought to be mitigated by the particle regularization scheme, such as the transport velocity formulation, significantly damps the flow in a long channel for both laminar and turbulent simulations. Building on this finding, this paper not only thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel flow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical numerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient consistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background pressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To comprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its potential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the residue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid standing wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the pressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length, resolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient correction technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be effective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability is fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is tested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting the necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high background pressure.</description>

      <title>Taylor$\unicode{x2013}$Aris dispersion of active particles in oscillatory channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass dispersion in oscillatory flows is intimately linked to various environmental and biological processes, offering a distinct contrast to dispersion in steady flows due to the periodic expansion and contraction of particle patches. In this study, we investigate the Taylor$\unicode{x2013}$Aris dispersion of active particles in laminar oscillatory flows between parallel plates. Two complementary approaches are employed: a two-time-variable expansion of the Smoluchowski equation is used to facilitate Aris' method of moments for the preasymptotic dispersion, while the generalised Taylor dispersion theory is extended to capture phase-dependent periodic drift and dispersivity in the long-time asymptotic limit. Applying both frameworks, we find that spherical non-gyrotactic swimmers can exhibit greater or lesser diffusivity than passive solutes in purely oscillatory flows, depending on the oscillation frequency. This behaviour arise primarily from the disruption of cross-streamline migration governed by Jeffery orbits. When a steady component is superimposed, oscillation induces a non-monotonic dual effect on diffusivity. We further examine two well-studied shear-related accumulation mechanisms, arising from gyrotaxis and elongation. Although these accumulation effects are less pronounced than in steady flows due to flow unsteadiness, gyrotactic swimmers respond more effectively to the unsteady shear profile, significantly altering their drift and dispersivity. This work offers new insights into the dispersion of active particles in oscillatory flows and also provides a foundation for studying periodic active dispersion beyond the oscillatory flow, such as periodic variations in shape and swimming speed.</description>

      <title>Stability theory for metal pad roll with consideration of viscous and magnetic damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model for the analytical prediction of the metal pad roll instability in idealised aluminium reduction cells consisting of two stably stratified liquid layers, which carry a vertical electric current and are exposed to a likewise vertical magnetic field. In contrast to the numerous previous models, we strive with this contribution for the most complete, and at the same time, a very approachable description of the linear metal pad roll instability. The model avoids the shallow-water approximation and incorporates some capillary effects, allowing it to be further applied to small-scale liquid metal batteries. As a major novelty the model also properly accounts for the stabilising effects of viscous and magnetic damping. To this end, we have derived explicit analytical formulae for the associated decay rates valid for arbitrary interfacial wave modes, which can also find application in other fields such as two-liquid sloshing. Our principal result is a set of explicit analytical solutions for stability thresholds and growth rates that are straightforward to implement and are intended to serve as theoretical benchmarks for multiphase magnetohydrodynamic solvers and model experiments. All of the results presented are carefully validated against five different and independent studies, with the particularity that we make use of quantitative stability threshold measurements for the first time.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}): A physics-data hybrid-driven approach for discovering dimensionless parameter combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters, making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions through optimal parameter transformations.</description>

      <title>Variational determination of minimal absorbing zones in incompressible shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical analysis of shear flows remains challenging, as turbulence generation and evolution are not fully understood. Here, a lesser-explored feature of incompressible shear flows-the absorbing zone-is investigated. This region in the infinite dimensional state space is shown to act as an attractor for all trajectories: any solution initialised outside eventually enters and remains inside. Consequently, the absorbing zone must contain all possible attractors, both chaotic and non-chaotic.
  Existence is established through the Reynolds-Orr identity, which indicates that nonlinear terms do not directly influence the temporal evolution of kinetic energy. The zone is constructed around a so-called shift flow, and multiple such regions may exist, even when the laminar state is linearly unstable. Gradient based optimisation is employed to identify the absorbing zone of minimal radius. Assuming a chaotic trajectory explores state space randomly, it is hypothesised that the centroid of this minimal zone approximates the turbulent mean flow. This central state is computed for plane Poiseuille and Couette flows and compared with established turbulent mean profiles.
  Although the proposed hypothesis is found to be an oversimplification-yielding profiles that qualitatively resemble but do not quantitatively reproduce the turbulent means-the methodology provides novel insights into shear flow dynamics. Furthermore, it offers a promising foundation for refining estimates of global stability thresholds. With continued development, this framework may facilitate the direct computation of turbulent mean states without reliance on empirical turbulence models or time-dependent numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An integrated theoretical, experimental, and numerical study of small-amplitude water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an inexpensive experimental setup for analyzing free-surface water waves: a $1\,\mathrm{m}$-long tabletop flume made from perspex, driven by a variable-frequency piston wavemaker built from Lego. Using mobile-phone video capture, we collect experimental data and compare it with predictions from linear gravity-capillary wave theory and with multiphase simulations performed in OpenFOAM. We find excellent quantitative agreement across all three approaches. Our setup may be valuable for students with a background in Mathematical Modelling who lack hands-on laboratory experience. To explore this, we report on a survey of students who completed an integrated theoretical, experimental, and computational project. While students found the experience enhanced their learning of Fluid Mechanics, they also noted the need for better support in setting up and running CFD simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonspherically symmetric equilibrium bubbles in a steadily rotating incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents two nontrivial, rotational equilibrium solutions to the spatial uniform gas pressure (isobaric) approximate model of Prosperetti in the inviscid case. Building on Gavrilov's work [GAFA 2019], we first establish the existence of equilibrium solutions with nontrivial (rotational) liquid flow. Second, we construct a nonspherically symmetric, horn-torus-shaped equilibrium bubble under mild spatial decay conditions of the liquid flow. In addition, we extend earlier results on the characterization of spherical equilibrium bubbles to the axisymmetric, purely azimuthal setting. Finally, we implement a numerical simulation of the equilibrium bubble shape using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approximation.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Coupling of Compressible Fluids and Thin Deformables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel discretization of coupled compressible fluid and thin deformable structures that provides sufficient and necessary leakproofness by preserving the path connectedness of the fluid domain. Our method employs a constrained Voronoi-based spatial partitioning combined with Godunov-style finite-volume time integration. The fluid domain is discretized into cells that conform exactly to the fluid-solid interface, allowing boundary conditions to be sharply resolved exactly at the interface. This enables direct force exchange between the fluid and solid while ensuring that no fluid leaks through the solid, even when arbitrarily thin. We validate our approach on a series of challenging scenarios -- including a balloon propelled by internal compressed air, a champagne cork ejecting after overcoming friction, and a supersonic asteroid -- demonstrating bidirectional energy transfer between fluid and solid.</description>
