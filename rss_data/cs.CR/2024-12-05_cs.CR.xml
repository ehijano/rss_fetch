      <title>Hacking CTFs with Plain Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We saturate a high-school-level hacking benchmark with plain LLM agent design. Concretely, we obtain 95% performance on InterCode-CTF, a popular offensive security benchmark, using prompting, tool use, and multiple attempts. This beats prior work by Phuong et al. 2024 (29%) and Abramovich et al. 2024 (72%).
  Our results suggest that current LLMs have surpassed the high school level in offensive cybersecurity. Their hacking capabilities remain underelicited: our ReAct&amp;Plan prompting strategy solves many challenges in 1-2 turns without complex engineering or advanced harnessing.</description>

      <title>Unleashing GHOST: An LLM-Powered Framework for Automated Hardware Trojan Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, inserting realistic Hardware Trojans (HTs) into complex hardware systems has been a time-consuming and manual process, requiring comprehensive knowledge of the design and navigating intricate Hardware Description Language (HDL) codebases. Machine Learning (ML)-based approaches have attempted to automate this process but often face challenges such as the need for extensive training data, long learning times, and limited generalizability across diverse hardware design landscapes. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing GHOST (Generator for Hardware-Oriented Stealthy Trojans), an automated attack framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid HT generation and insertion. Our study evaluates three state-of-the-art LLMs - GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-pro, and Llama-3-70B - across three hardware designs: SRAM, AES, and UART. According to our evaluations, GPT-4 demonstrates superior performance, with 88.88% of HT insertion attempts successfully generating functional and synthesizable HTs. This study also highlights the security risks posed by LLM-generated HTs, showing that 100% of GHOST-generated synthesizable HTs evaded detection by an ML-based HT detection tool. These results underscore the urgent need for advanced detection and prevention mechanisms in hardware security to address the emerging threat of LLM-generated HTs. The GHOST HT benchmarks are available at: https://github.com/HSTRG1/GHOSTbenchmarks.git</description>

      <title>Optimized IoT Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An application of software known as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) employs machine algorithms to identify network intrusions. Selective logging, safeguarding privacy, reputation-based defense against numerous attacks, and dynamic response to threats are a few of the problems that intrusion identification is used to solve. The biological system known as IoT has seen a rapid increase in high dimensionality and information traffic. Self-protective mechanisms like intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for defending against a variety of attacks. On the other hand, the functional and physical diversity of IoT IDS systems causes significant issues. These attributes make it troublesome and unrealistic to completely use all IoT elements and properties for IDS self-security. For peculiarity-based IDS, this study proposes and implements a novel component selection and extraction strategy (our strategy). A five-ML algorithm model-based IDS for machine learning-based networks with proper hyperparamater tuning is presented in this paper by examining how the most popular feature selection methods and classifiers are combined, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Decision Tree (DT) Classifier, Random Forest (RF) Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Ada Boost Classifier. The Random Forest (RF) classifier had the highest accuracy of 99.39%. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier exhibited the lowest performance among the evaluated models, achieving an accuracy of 94.84%. This study's models have a significantly higher performance rate than those used in previous studies, indicating that they are more reliable.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Functional Web Tool for Comprehensive Threat Detection Through IP Address Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the advances in digitalisation have also adversely contributed to the significant rise in cybercrimes. Hence, building the threat intelligence to shield against rising cybercrimes has become a fundamental requisite. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses play a crucial role in the threat intelligence and prevention of cyber crimes. However, we have noticed the lack of one-stop, free, and open-source tools that can analyse IP addresses. Hence, this work introduces a comprehensive web tool for advanced IP address characterisation. Our tool offers a wide range of features, including geolocation, blocklist check, VPN detection, proxy detection, bot detection, Tor detection, port scan, and accurate domain statistics that include the details about the name servers and registrar information. In addition, our tool calculates a confidence score based on a weighted sum of publicly accessible online results from different reliable sources to give users a dependable measure of accuracy. Further, to improve performance, our tool also incorporates a local database for caching the results, to enable fast content retrieval with minimal external Web API calls. Our tool supports domain names and IPv4 addresses, making it a multi-functional and powerful IP analyser tool for threat intelligence. Our tool is available at www.ipanalyzer.in</description>

      <title>Revisiting Atomic Patterns for Elliptic Curve Scalar Multiplication Revealing Inherent Vulnerability to Simple SCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic Curve Scalar Multiplication denoted as kP operation is the basic operation in all Elliptic Curve based cryptographic protocols. The atomicity principle and different atomic patterns for kP algorithms were proposed in the past as countermeasures against simple side-channel analysis. In this work, we investigated the resistance of a kP algorithm implemented in hardware using Longa's atomic patterns. We analysed its simulated power trace. We show in the example of our kP implementation for the NIST EC P-256 that the field squaring operations are distinguishable from the field multiplications even if they are performed by the same field multiplier, due to the addressing of the second multiplicand. This inherent vulnerability of atomic patterns can be successfully exploited for revealing the scalar k.</description>

      <title>EAP-FIDO: A Novel EAP Method for Using FIDO2 Credentials for Network Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of FIDO2 authentication by major tech companies in web applications has grown significantly in recent years. However, we argue FIDO2 has broader potential applications. In this paper, we introduce EAP-FIDO, a novel Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method for use in IEEE 802.1X-protected networks. This allows organisations with WPA2/3-Enterprise wireless networks or MACSec-enabled wired networks to leverage FIDO2's passwordless authentication in compliance with existing standards. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive security and performance analysis to support the feasibility of this approach.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Forgery Attacks on Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Teaching an Old Dog New Tricks: Verifiable FHE Using Commodity Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Argos, a simple approach for adding verifiability to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes using trusted hardware. Traditional approaches to verifiable FHE require expensive cryptographic proofs, which incur an overhead of up to seven orders of magnitude on top of FHE, making them impractical.
  With Argos, we show that trusted hardware can be securely used to provide verifiability for FHE computations, with minimal overhead relative to the baseline FHE computation. An important contribution of Argos is showing that the major security pitfall associated with trusted hardware, microarchitectural side channels, can be completely mitigated by excluding any secrets from the CPU and the memory hierarchy. This is made possible by focusing on building a platform that only enforces program and data integrity and not confidentiality (which is sufficient for verifiable FHE, since all data remain encrypted at all times). All secrets related to the attestation mechanism are kept in a separate coprocessor (e.g., a TPM) inaccessible to any software-based attacker. Relying on a discrete TPM typically incurs significant performance overhead, which is why (insecure) software-based TPMs are used in practice. As a second contribution, we show that for FHE applications, the attestation protocol can be adapted to only incur a fixed cost.
  Argos requires no dedicated hardware extensions and is supported on commodity processors from 2008 onward. Our prototype implementation introduces 6% overhead to the FHE evaluation, and 8% for more complex protocols. In particular, we show that Argos can be adapted for real-world applications of FHE, such as PIR and PSI. By demonstrating how to combine cryptography with trusted hardware, Argos paves the way for widespread deployment of FHE-based protocols beyond the semi-honest setting, without the overhead of cryptographic proofs.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Distinguishability of Product Distributions through Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of samples $x_1, \dots , x_k$ promised to be drawn from one of two distributions $X_0, X_1$, a well-studied problem in statistics is to decide $\textit{which}$ distribution the samples are from. Information theoretically, the maximum advantage in distinguishing the two distributions given $k$ samples is captured by the total variation distance between $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$. However, when we restrict our attention to $\textit{efficient distinguishers}$ (i.e., small circuits) of these two distributions, exactly characterizing the ability to distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ is more involved and less understood.
  In this work, we give a general way to reduce bounds on the computational indistinguishability of $X_0$ and $X_1$ to bounds on the $\textit{information-theoretic}$ indistinguishability of some specific, related variables $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$. As a consequence, we prove a new, tight characterization of the number of samples $k$ needed to efficiently distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ with constant advantage as
  \[
  k = \Theta\left(d_H^{-2}\left(\widetilde{X}_0, \widetilde{X}_1\right)\right),
  \] which is the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance $d_H$ between two distributions $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$ that are computationally indistinguishable from $X_0$ and $X_1$. Likewise, our framework can be used to re-derive a result of Geier (TCC 2022), proving nearly-tight bounds on how computational indistinguishability scales with the number of samples for arbitrary product distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research explores the integration of blockchain technology in healthcare, focusing on enhancing the security and efficiency of Electronic Health Record (EHR) management. We propose a novel Ethereum-based system that empowers patients with secure control over their medical data. Our approach addresses key challenges in healthcare blockchain implementation, including scalability, privacy, and regulatory compliance. The system incorporates digital signatures, Role-Based Access Control, and a multi-layered architecture to ensure secure, controlled access. We developed a decentralized application (dApp) with user-friendly interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators, demonstrating the practical application of our solution. A survey among healthcare professionals and IT experts revealed strong interest in blockchain adoption, while also highlighting concerns about integration costs. The study explores future enhancements, including integration with IoT devices and AI-driven analytics, contributing to the evolution of secure, efficient, and interoperable healthcare systems that leverage cutting-edge technologies for improved patient care.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection for Neurosymbolic Autonomous Cyber Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents for cyber applications take advantage of modern defense techniques by adopting intelligent agents with conventional and learning-enabled components. These intelligent agents are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, and can learn, adapt to, reason about and deploy security rules to defend networked computer systems while maintaining critical operational workflows. However, the knowledge available during training about the state of the operational network and its environment may be limited. The agents should be trustworthy so that they can reliably detect situations they cannot handle, and hand them over to cyber experts. In this work, we develop an out-of-distribution (OOD) Monitoring algorithm that uses a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to detect anomalous or OOD situations of RL-based agents with discrete states and discrete actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we integrate the OOD monitoring algorithm with a neurosymbolic autonomous cyber agent that uses behavior trees with learning-enabled components. We evaluate the proposed approach in a simulated cyber environment under different adversarial strategies. Experimental results over a large number of episodes illustrate the overall efficiency of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Wireless Sensing Security from a Role-Based View: Victim, Weapon, and Shield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing technology has become prevalent in healthcare, smart homes, and autonomous driving due to its non-contact operation, penetration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. As its applications expand, the technology faces mounting security challenges: sensing systems can be attack targets, signals can be weaponized, or signals can function as security shields. Despite these security concerns significantly impacting the technology's development, a systematic review remains lacking. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of wireless sensing security through a role-based perspective. Analyzing over 200 publications from 2020-2024, we propose a novel classification framework that systematically categorizes existing research into three main classes: (1) wireless systems as victims of attacks, (2) wireless signals as weapons for attacks, and (3) wireless signals as shields for security applications. This role-based classification method is not only intuitive and easy to understand, but also reflects the essential connection between wireless signals and security issues. Through systematic literature review and quantitative analysis, this paper outlines a panoramic view of wireless sensing security, revealing key technological trends and innovation opportunities, thereby helping to promote the development of this field.

      <title>PBP: Post-training Backdoor Purification for Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official}.</description>

      <title>State Frequency Estimation for Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many works have studied the efficacy of state machines for detecting anomalies within NetFlows. These works typically learn a model from unlabeled data and compute anomaly scores for arbitrary traces based on their likelihood of occurrence or how well they fit within the model. However, these methods do not dynamically adapt their scores based on the traces seen at test time. This becomes a problem when an adversary produces seemingly common traces in their attack, causing the model to miss the detection by assigning low anomaly scores. We propose SEQUENT, a new approach that uses the state visit frequency to adapt its scoring for anomaly detection dynamically. SEQUENT subsequently uses the scores to generate root causes for anomalies. These allow the grouping of alarms and simplify the analysis of anomalies. Our evaluation of SEQUENT on three NetFlow datasets indicates that our approach outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies.</description>

      <title>HCC: A Language-Independent Hardening Contract Compiler for Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing secure smart contracts remains a challenging task. Existing approaches are either impractical or leave the burden to developers for fixing bugs. In this paper, we propose the first practical smart contract compiler, called HCC, which automatically inserts security hardening checks at the source-code level based on a novel and language-independent code property graph (CPG) notation. The high expressiveness of our developed CPG allows us to mitigate all of the most common smart contract vulnerabilities, namely reentrancy, integer bugs, suicidal smart contracts, improper use of tx.origin, untrusted delegate-calls, and unchecked low-level call bugs. Our large-scale evaluation on 10k real-world contracts and several sets of vulnerable contracts from related work demonstrates that HCC is highly practical, outperforms state-of-the-art contract hardening techniques, and effectively prevents all verified attack transactions without hampering functional correctness.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Attacks and Countermeasures in Natural Language Processing Models: A Comprehensive Security Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06055v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are becoming increasingly popular in real-world applications. Outsourcing model training and data hosting to third-party platforms has become a standard method for reducing costs. In such a situation, the attacker can manipulate the training process or data to inject a backdoor into models. Backdoor attacks are a serious threat where malicious behavior is activated when triggers are present, otherwise, the model operates normally.
  However, there is still no systematic and comprehensive review of LMs from the attacker's capabilities and purposes on different backdoor attack surfaces. Moreover, there is a shortage of analysis and comparison of the diverse emerging backdoor countermeasures. Therefore, this work aims to provide the NLP community with a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures. According to the attackers' capability and affected stage of the LMs, the attack surfaces are formalized into four categorizations: attacking the pre-trained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (APMP), attacking the final model with training (AFMT), and attacking Large Language Models (ALLM). Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Thus, we review countermeasures and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we summarize the benchmark datasets and provide comparable evaluations for representative attacks and defenses. Drawing the insights from the review, we point out the crucial areas for future research on the backdoor, especially soliciting more efficient and practical countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Security, Latency, and Throughput of Proof-of-Work Nakamoto Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05506v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental trade-offs between block safety, confirmation latency, and transaction throughput of proof-of-work (PoW) longest-chain fork-choice protocols, also known as PoW Nakamoto consensus. New upper and lower bounds are derived for the probability of block safety violations as a function of honest and adversarial mining rates, a block propagation delay limit, and confirmation latency measured in both time and block depth. The results include the first non-trivial closed-form finite-latency bound applicable across all delays and mining rates up to the ultimate fault tolerance. Notably, the gap between these upper and lower bounds is narrower than previously established bounds for a wide range of parameters relevant to Bitcoin and its derivatives, including Litecoin and Dogecoin, as well as Ethereum Classic. Additionally, the study uncovers a fundamental trade-off between transaction throughput and confirmation latency, ultimately determined by the desired fault tolerance and the rate at which block propagation delay increases with block size.</description>

      <title>When LLMs Meet Cybersecurity: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an evolving threat landscape and demand for innovative technologies. Despite initial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review, covering the analysis of over 300 works, encompassing 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios. Our comprehensive overview addresses three key research questions: the construction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, the application of LLMs to various cybersecurity tasks, the challenges and further research in this area. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in enhancing cybersecurity practices and serve as a valuable resource for applying LLMs in this field. We also maintain and regularly update a list of practical guides on LLMs for cybersecurity at https://github.com/tmylla/Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Data Deduplication for Enhancing Federated Learning of Language Models (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.62\% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95\% reduction in running time while varying the duplication level between 10\% and 30\%. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Remote Staking with Optimal Economic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains require validators to lock their tokens as collateral, slashing these tokens if they are identified as protocol violators. PoS chains have mostly been secured by their native tokens. However, using only the native token upper-bounds the value eligible for staking by the market capitalization of the native token. In contrast, the remote staking of another crypto asset from a provider chain provides an avenue to improve the consumer chain's economic security. In this paper, we present the first known remote staking protocols with guaranteed optimal economic safety: whenever there is a safety violation on the consumer chain, at least one third of the provider's stake securing the consumer chain is slashed. To achieve this goal for a broad range of provider and consumer chains, two independent contributions are made: 1) a cryptographic protocol to slash stake even without smart contracts on the provider chain; 2) a secure unbonding protocol that ensures slashing before the stake is unbonded on the provider chain if there is safety violation on the consumer chain. A major use case of this work is when the provider chain is Bitcoin, making available an asset worth more than 1.7 trillion USD to secure PoS chains. Such a Bitcoin staking protocol has been launched on the Mainnet in August 2024 and has accumulated 2.1 billion USD worth of stake thus far.</description>

      <title>Control-Flow Attestation: Concepts, Solutions, and Open Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control-flow attestation unifies the worlds of control-flow integrity and platform attestation by measuring and reporting a target's run-time behaviour to a verifier. Trust assurances in the target are provided by testing whether its execution follows an authorised control-flow path. The problem has been explored in various settings, such as assessing the trustworthiness of cloud platforms, cyber-physical systems, and Internet of Things devices. Despite a significant number of proposals being made in recent years, the area remains fragmented, with different adversarial behaviours, verification paradigms, and deployment challenges being addressed. In this paper, we present the first survey of control-flow attestation, examining the core ideas and solutions in state-of-the-art schemes. In total, we survey over 30 papers published between 2016--2024, consolidate and compare their key features, and pose several challenges and recommendations for future research in the area.</description>

      <title>"Moralized" Multi-Step Jailbreak Prompts: Black-Box Testing of Guardrails in Large Language Models for Verbal Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the application of large language models continues to expand in various fields, it poses higher challenges to the effectiveness of identifying harmful content generation and guardrail mechanisms. This research aims to evaluate the guardrail effectiveness of GPT-4o, Grok-2 Beta, Llama 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet through black-box testing of seemingly ethical multi-step jailbreak prompts. It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious. To ensure objectivity, the experimental process, black box test code, and enhanced guardrail code are uploaded to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/brucewang123456789/GeniusTrail.git.</description>

      <title>Blindfold: Confidential Memory Management by Untrusted Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confidential Computing (CC) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mechanism to protect user data from untrusted operating systems (OSes). Existing CC solutions hide confidential memory from the OS and/or encrypt it to achieve confidentiality. In doing so, they render OS memory optimization unusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for optimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the kernel semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on ARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of enabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show Blindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive performance. More importantly, we show that the Linux kernel, including all of its memory optimizations except memory compression, can function properly for confidential memory. This requires only about 400 lines of kernel modifications.</description>

      <title>Retrofitting XoM for Stripped Binaries without Embedded Data Relocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PXoM, a practical technique to seamlessly retrofit XoM into stripped binaries on the x86-64 platform. As handling the mixture of code and data is a well-known challenge for XoM, most existing methods require the strict separation of code and data areas via either compile-time transformation or binary patching, so that the unreadable permission can be safely enforced at the granularity of memory pages. In contrast to previous approaches, we provide a fine-grained memory permission control mechanism to restrict the read permission of code while allowing legitimate data reads within code pages. This novelty enables PXoM to harden stripped binaries but without resorting to error-prone embedded data relocation. We leverage Intel's hardware feature, Memory Protection Keys, to offer an efficient fine-grained permission control. We measure PXoM's performance with both micro- and macro-benchmarks, and it only introduces negligible runtime overhead. Our security evaluation shows that PXoM leaves adversaries with little wiggle room to harvest all of the required gadgets, suggesting PXoM is practical for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>AED-PADA:Improving Generalizability of Adversarial Example Detection via Principal Adversarial Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial example detection, which can be conveniently applied in many scenarios, is important in the area of adversarial defense. Unfortunately, existing detection methods suffer from poor generalization performance, because their training process usually relies on the examples generated from a single known adversarial attack and there exists a large discrepancy between the training and unseen testing adversarial examples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, named Adversarial Example Detection via Principal Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AED-PADA). Specifically, our approach identifies the Principal Adversarial Domains (PADs), i.e., a combination of features of the adversarial examples generated by different attacks, which possesses a large portion of the entire adversarial feature space. Subsequently, we pioneer to exploit Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in adversarial example detection, with PADs as the source domains. Experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our proposed AED-PADA. Note that this superiority is particularly achieved in challenging scenarios characterized by employing the minimal magnitude constraint for the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Deferred Poisoning: Making the Model More Vulnerable via Hessian Singularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are very vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Many defense methods have been proposed to address this issue. However, traditional poisoning attacks are not as threatening as commonly believed. This is because they often cause differences in how the model performs on the training set compared to the validation set. Such inconsistency can alert defenders that their data has been poisoned, allowing them to take the necessary defensive actions. In this paper, we introduce a more threatening type of poisoning attack called the Deferred Poisoning Attack. This new attack allows the model to function normally during the training and validation phases but makes it very sensitive to evasion attacks or even natural noise. We achieve this by ensuring the poisoned model's loss function has a similar value as a normally trained model at each input sample but with a large local curvature. A similar model loss ensures that there is no obvious inconsistency between the training and validation accuracy, demonstrating high stealthiness. On the other hand, the large curvature implies that a small perturbation may cause a significant increase in model loss, leading to substantial performance degradation, which reflects a worse robustness. We fulfill this purpose by making the model have singular Hessian information at the optimal point via our proposed Singularization Regularization term. We have conducted both theoretical and empirical analyses of the proposed method and validated its effectiveness through experiments on image classification tasks. Furthermore, we have confirmed the hazards of this form of poisoning attack under more general scenarios using natural noise, offering a new perspective for research in the field of security.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>Pay Attention to the Robustness of Chinese Minority Language Models! Syllable-level Textual Adversarial Attack on Tibetan Script</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The textual adversarial attack refers to an attack method in which the attacker adds imperceptible perturbations to the original texts by elaborate design so that the NLP (natural language processing) model produces false judgments. This method is also used to evaluate the robustness of NLP models. Currently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages. Textual adversarial attacks are a new challenge for the information processing of Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a Tibetan syllable-level black-box textual adversarial attack called TSAttacker based on syllable cosine distance and scoring mechanism. And then, we conduct TSAttacker on six models generated by fine-tuning two PLMs (pre-trained language models) for three downstream tasks. The experiment results show that TSAttacker is effective and generates high-quality adversarial samples. In addition, the robustness of the involved models still has much room for improvement.</description>
