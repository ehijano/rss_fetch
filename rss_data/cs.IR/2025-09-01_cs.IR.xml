      <title>The Hidden Cost of Defaults in Recommender System Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization is critical for improving the performance of recommender systems, yet its implementation is often treated as a neutral or secondary concern. In this work, we shift focus from model benchmarking to auditing the behavior of RecBole, a widely used recommendation framework. We show that RecBole's internal defaults, particularly an undocumented early-stopping policy, can prematurely terminate Random Search and Bayesian Optimization. This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies. These results highlight the importance of treating frameworks as active components of experimental design and call for more transparent, reproducibility-aware tooling in recommender systems research. We provide actionable recommendations for researchers and developers to mitigate hidden configuration behaviors and improve the transparency of hyperparameter tuning workflows.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Cold-Start Barrier: Reinforcement Learning with Double and Dueling DQNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Towards On-Device Personalization: Cloud-device Collaborative Data Augmentation for Efficient On-device Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), significant progress has been achieved in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, existing LLMs still face two major challenges that hinder their broader adoption: (1) their responses tend to be generic and lack personalization tailored to individual users, and (2) they rely heavily on cloud infrastructure due to intensive computational requirements, leading to stable network dependency and response delay. Recent research has predominantly focused on either developing cloud-based personalized LLMs or exploring the on-device deployment of general-purpose LLMs. However, few studies have addressed both limitations simultaneously by investigating personalized on-device language models. To bridge this gap, we propose CDCDA-PLM, a framework for deploying personalized on-device language models on user devices with support from a powerful cloud-based LLM. Specifically, CDCDA-PLM leverages the server-side LLM's strong generalization capabilities to augment users' limited personal data, mitigating the issue of data scarcity. Using both real and synthetic data, A personalized on-device language models (LMs) is fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules and deployed on users' local devices, enabling them to process queries without depending on cloud-based LLMs. This approach eliminates reliance on network stability and ensures high response speeds. Experimental results across six tasks in a widely used personalization benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CDCDA-PLM.</description>

      <title>Stairway to Fairness: Connecting Group and Individual Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3 datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/theresiavr/stairway-to-fairness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Recabilities of Foundation Models: A Multi-Domain, Multi-Dataset Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation capabilities of existing foundation models across diverse datasets and domains is essential for advancing the development of recommendation foundation models. In this study, we introduce RecBench-MD, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the recommendation abilities of foundation models from a zero-resource, multi-dataset, and multi-domain perspective. Through extensive evaluations of 19 foundation models across 15 datasets spanning 10 diverse domains -- including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media -- we identify key characteristics of these models in recommendation tasks. Our findings suggest that in-domain fine-tuning achieves optimal performance, while cross-dataset transfer learning provides effective practical support for new recommendation scenarios. Additionally, we observe that multi-domain training significantly enhances the adaptability of foundation models. All code and data have been publicly released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following link: https://github.com/Cxx-0/Diff-MSIN.</description>

      <title>Geospatial Question Answering on Historical Maps Using Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled the extraction of vectorized features from digital historical maps. To fully leverage this information, however, the extracted features must be organized in a structured and meaningful way that supports efficient access and use. One promising approach is question answering (QA), which allows users -- especially those unfamiliar with database query languages -- to retrieve knowledge in a natural and intuitive manner. In this project, we developed a GeoQA system by integrating a spatio-temporal knowledge graph (KG) constructed from historical map data with large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we have defined the ontology to guide the construction of the spatio-temporal KG and investigated workflows of two different types of GeoQA: factual and descriptive. Additional data sources, such as historical map images and internet search results, are incorporated into our framework to provide extra context for descriptive GeoQA. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system can generate answers with a high delivery rate and a high semantic accuracy. To make the framework accessible, we further developed a web application that supports interactive querying and visualization.</description>

      <title>NewsReX: A More Efficient Approach to News Recommendation with Keras 3 and JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing and comparing results in news recommendation research has become increasingly difficult. This is due to a fragmented ecosystem of diverse codebases, varied configurations, and mainly due to resource-intensive models. We introduce NewsReX, an open-source library designed to streamline this process. Our key contribution is a modern implementation built on Keras 3 and JAX, which provides an increase in computational efficiency. Experiments show that NewsReX is faster than current implementations. To support broader research, we provide a straightforward guide and scripts for training models on custom datasets. We validated this functionality using a proprietary Japanese news dataset from Nikkei News, a leading Japanese media corporation renowned for its comprehensive coverage of business, economic, and financial news. NewsReX makes reproducing complex experiments faster and more accessible to a wider range of hardware making sure the speed up it also achieved for less powerful GPUs, like an 8GB RTX 3060 Ti. Beyond the library, this paper offers an analysis of key training parameters often overlooked in the literature, including the effect of different negative sampling strategies, the varying number of epochs, the impact of random batching, and more. This supplementary analysis serves as a valuable reference for future research, aiming to reduce redundant computation when comparing baselines and guide best practices.

      <title>Unidentified and Confounded? Understanding Two-Tower Models for Unbiased Learning to Rank (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive two-tower models are popular learning-to-rank methods for handling biased user feedback in industry settings. Recent studies, however, report a concerning phenomenon: training two-tower models on clicks collected by well-performing production systems leads to decreased ranking performance. This paper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding effects from logging policies and model identifiability issues. We theoretically analyze the identifiability conditions of two-tower models, showing that either document swaps across positions or overlapping feature distributions are required to recover model parameters from clicks. We also investigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that they introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior. However, logging policies can amplify biases when models imperfectly capture user behavior, particularly when prediction errors correlate with document placement across positions. We propose a sample weighting technique to mitigate these effects and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners using two-tower models.</description>

      <title>T-Retrievability: A Topic-Focused Approach to Measure Fair Document Exposure in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrievability of a document is a collection-based statistic that measures its expected (reciprocal) rank of being retrieved within a specific rank cut-off. A collection with uniformly distributed retrievability scores across documents is an indicator of fair document exposure. While retrievability scores have been used to quantify the fairness of exposure for a collection, in our work, we use the distribution of retrievability scores to measure the exposure bias of retrieval models. We hypothesise that an uneven distribution of retrievability scores across the entire collection may not accurately reflect exposure bias but rather indicate variations in topical relevance. As a solution, we propose a topic-focused localised retrievability measure, which we call \textit{T-Retrievability} (topic-retrievability), which first computes retrievability scores over multiple groups of topically-related documents, and then aggregates these localised values to obtain the collection-level statistics. Our analysis using this proposed T-Retrievability measure uncovers new insights into the exposure characteristics of various neural ranking models. The findings suggest that this localised measure provides a more nuanced understanding of exposure fairness, offering a more reliable approach for assessing document accessibility in IR systems.</description>

      <title>DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps, DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%.</description>

      <title>Synthetic CVs To Build and Test Fairness-Aware Hiring Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles, which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown, however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.</description>

Abstract: jina-code-embeddings is a novel code embedding model suite designed to retrieve code from natural language queries, perform technical question-answering, and identify semantically similar code snippets across programming languages. It makes innovative use of an autoregressive backbone pre-trained on both text and code, generating embeddings via last-token pooling. We outline the training recipe and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance despite the relatively small size of the models, validating this approach to code embedding model construction.</description>

      <title>What Data is Really Necessary? A Feasibility Study of Inference Data Minimization for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data, remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets, choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity' difficult to implement.</description>

      <title>Going over Fine Web with a Fine-Tooth Comb: Technical Report of Indexing Fine Web for Problematic Content Search and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models. However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages), achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2 seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Macro Graph of Experts for Billion-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs. Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures, relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts. Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE in billion-scale recommender systems.</description>

      <title>TrueGL: A Truthful, Reliable, and Unified Engine for Grounded Learning in Full-Stack Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the age of open and free information, a concerning trend of reliance on AI is emerging. However, existing AI tools struggle to evaluate the credibility of information and to justify their assessments. Hence, there is a growing need for systems that can help users evaluate the trustworthiness of online information. Although major search engines incorporate AI features, they often lack clear reliability indicators. We present TrueGL, a model that makes trustworthy search results more accessible. The model is a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B, trained on the custom dataset and integrated into a search engine with a reliability scoring system. We evaluate the system using prompt engineering and assigning each statement a continuous reliability score from 0.1 to 1, then instructing the model to return a textual explanation alongside the score. Each model's predicted scores are measured against real scores using standard evaluation metrics. TrueGL consistently outperforms other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches across all experiments on key evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and R2. The model's high accuracy, broad content coverage, and ease of use make trustworthy information more accessible and help reduce the spread of false or misleading content online. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/TrueGL, and our model is publicly released at https://huggingface.co/JoydeepC/trueGL.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Decoding for LLM-Based Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have been widely applied to sequential recommendation tasks, yet during inference, they continue to rely on decoding strategies developed for natural language processing. This creates a mismatch between text-generation objectives and recommendation next item selection objectives. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an Uncertainty-aware Semantic Decoding (USD) framework that combines logit-based clustering with adaptive scoring to improve next-item predictions. Our approach clusters items with similar logit vectors into semantic equivalence groups, then redistributes probability mass within these clusters and computes entropy across them to control item scoring and sampling temperature during recommendation inference. Experiments on Amazon Product datasets (six domains) gains of 18.5\% in HR@3, 11.9\% in NDCG@3, and 10.8\% in MRR@3 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hyperparameter analysis confirms the optimal parameters among various settings, and experiments on H\&amp;M, and Netflix datasets indicate that the framework can adapt to differing recommendation domains. The experimental results confirm that integrating semantic clustering and uncertainty assessment yields more reliable and accurate recommendations.</description>

      <title>Refining Text Generation for Realistic Conversational Recommendation via Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to elicit user preferences via natural dialogue to provide suitable item recommendations. However, current CRSs often deviate from realistic human interactions by rapidly recommending items in brief sessions. This work addresses this gap by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate dialogue summaries from dialogue history and item recommendation information from item description. This approach enables the extraction of both explicit user statements and implicit preferences inferred from the dialogue context. We introduce a method using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to ensure dialogue summary and item recommendation information are rich in information crucial for effective recommendations. Experiments on two public datasets validate our method's effectiveness in fostering more natural and realistic conversational recommendation processes. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/Refining-LLM-Text</description>

      <title>THEME: Enhancing Thematic Investing with Semantic Stock Representations and Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thematic investing, which aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural trends, remains a challenging endeavor due to overlapping sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. A promising direction is to build semantic representations of investment themes from textual data. However, despite their power, general-purpose LLM embedding models are not well-suited to capture the nuanced characteristics of financial assets, since the semantic representation of investment assets may differ fundamentally from that of general financial text. To address this, we introduce THEME, a framework that fine-tunes embeddings using hierarchical contrastive learning. THEME aligns themes and their constituent stocks using their hierarchical relationship, and subsequently refines these embeddings by incorporating stock returns. This process yields representations effective for retrieving thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results demonstrate that THEME excels in two key areas. For thematic asset retrieval, it significantly outperforms leading large language models. Furthermore, its constructed portfolios demonstrate compelling performance. By jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from returns, THEME generates stock embeddings specifically tailored for a wide range of practical investment applications.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Bigger Picture: Comprehensive Event Understanding Via Diverse News Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to diverse perspectives is essential for understanding real-world events, yet most news retrieval systems prioritize textual relevance, leading to redundant results and limited viewpoint exposure. We propose NEWSCOPE, a two-stage framework for diverse news retrieval that enhances event coverage by explicitly modeling semantic variation at the sentence level. The first stage retrieves topically relevant content using dense retrieval, while the second stage applies sentence-level clustering and diversity-aware re-ranking to surface complementary information. To evaluate retrieval diversity, we introduce three interpretable metrics, namely Average Pairwise Distance, Positive Cluster Coverage, and Information Density Ratio, and construct two paragraph-level benchmarks: LocalNews and DSGlobal. Experiments show that NEWSCOPE consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significantly higher diversity without compromising relevance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fine-grained, interpretable modeling in mitigating redundancy and promoting comprehensive event understanding. The data and code are available at https://github.com/tangyixuan/NEWSCOPE.</description>

      <title>Exploring Selective Retrieval-Augmentation for Long-Tail Legal Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legal text classification is a fundamental NLP task in the legal domain. Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution, where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on rare classes. This paper explores Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a proof-of-concept approach to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external corpora simultaneously. SRA is tested on two legal text classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). Results show that SRA achieves consistent gains in both micro-F1 and macro-F1 over LexGLUE baselines.</description>
