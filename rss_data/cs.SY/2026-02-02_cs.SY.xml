      <title>Regional Transportation Modeling for Equitable Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) holds promise for mitigating emission-related health impacts, particularly for low-income communities disproportionately affected by exposure to traffic-related air pollution. However, designing effective charging infrastructure necessitates a regional modeling approach that accounts for the inherent cross-jurisdictional nature of mobility patterns. This study underscores the importance of regional modeling in optimizing charging station deployment and evaluating the environmental justice implications for equity priority communities. We present a large-scale regional transportation modeling analysis leveraging Mobiliti, a cloud-based platform that employs parallel discrete event simulation to enable rapid computation. Our approach identifies the spatial demand density for charging infrastructure by analyzing over 19 million trips in the San Francisco Bay Area and determining the threshold points where BEVs may require charging across a typical day. By transitioning these trips that originate outside equity priority communities to BEVs, we quantify the potential emission reductions within these vulnerable areas. The regional modeling framework captures the complex interactions between travel behavior, vehicle characteristics, and charging needs, while accounting for the interconnectivity of infrastructure across municipal boundaries. This study demonstrates the critical role of regional modeling in designing equitable BEV charging networks that address environmental justice concerns. The findings inform strategies for deploying charging infrastructure that maximizes accessibility, minimizes range anxiety, and prioritizes the health and well-being of communities disproportionately burdened by transportation emissions.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Non-linear Dynamics of Lithium-ion Batteries via Delay-Embedded Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex electrochemical behavior of lithium-ion batteries results in non-linear dynamics and appropriate modeling of this non-linear dynamical system is of interest for better management and control. In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.</description>

      <title>Approximately Optimal Multi-Stream Quickest Change Detection for Gaussian Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the bandit quickest change detection problem in which one stream contains a change-point that shifts its distribution by an unknown amount in an unknown direction. We consider an agent that can observe only a single stream at each time, and the goal of the agent is to detect this change as quickly as possible while controlling for false alarms. We propose an algorithm that combines a decaying-$\epsilon$-greedy stream switching rule with an efficient change-point detection algorithm for unknown post-change means. We provide bounds on the expected detection delay and average run length to false alarm for our algorithm, and based on these results we prove our algorithm is approximately optimal with respect to a commonly used surrogate. This work is the first to provide provable guarantees in this setting without strong assumptions such as a discretized post-change parameter set or a lower bound on the magnitude of change.</description>

      <title>Degradation-Aware Frequency Regulation of a Heterogeneous Battery Fleet via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems are increasingly deployed as fast-responding resources for grid balancing services such as frequency regulation and for mitigating renewable generation uncertainty. However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.
  Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.
  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Co-Design and Operation of Chiller and Thermal Energy Storage for Cost-Optimal HVAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint operation and sizing of cooling infrastructure for commercial HVAC systems using reinforcement learning, with the objective of minimizing life-cycle cost over a 30-year horizon. The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.</description>

      <title>Energy Management Strategies for Electric Aircraft Charging Leveraging Active Landside Vehicle-to-Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of medium-range battery electric aircraft is a promising pathway to improve the environmental footprint of air mobility. Yet such a deployment would be accompanied by significant electric power requirements at airports due to aircraft charging. Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of Constrained Linear Systems using Online Convex Optimization and a Reference Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a control method for linear time-invariant systems subject to time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions, that satisfies state and input constraints, and is robust to exogenous disturbances. To this end, we combine the online convex optimization framework with a reference governor and a constraint tightening approach. The proposed framework guarantees recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction. Its closed-loop performance is studied in terms of its dynamic regret, which is bounded linearly by the variation of the cost functions and the magnitude of the disturbances. The proposed method is illustrated by a numerical case study of a tracking control problem.</description>

      <title>Forecasting in the presence of scale-free noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extraction of signals from noise is a common problem in all areas of science and engineering. A particularly useful version is that of forecasting: determining a causal filter that estimates a future value of a hidden process from past observations. Current techniques for deriving the filter require that the noise be well described by rational power spectra. However, scale-free noises, whose spectra scale as a non-integer power of frequency, are ubiquitous in practice. We establish a method, together with performance guarantees, that solves the forecasting problem in the presence of scale-free noise. Via the duality between estimation and control, our technique can be used to design control for distributed systems. These results will have wide-ranging applications in neuroscience, finance, fluid dynamics, and quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Signal Recovery in Nonlinear Systems with Spectrally Separated Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper Mid-Band (FR3, 7-24 GHz) receivers for 6G must operate over wide bandwidths in dense spectral environments, making them particularly vulnerable to strong adjacent-band interference and front-end nonlinearities. While conventional linear receivers can suppress spectrally separated interferers under ideal hardware assumptions, receiver saturation and finite-resolution quantization cause nonlinear spectral leakage that severely degrades performance in practical wideband radios. We study the recovery of a desired signal from nonlinear receiver observations corrupted by a high-power out-of-band interferer. The receiver front-end is modeled as a smooth, memoryless nonlinearity followed by additive noise and optional quantization. To mitigate these nonlinear and quantization-induced distortions, we propose a learned multi-layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (LMLVAMP) algorithm that incorporates spectral priors with neural network based denoising. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional methods, particularly in high-interference regimes representative of FR3 coexistence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Interpolation Techniques for Fast Channel Estimation in Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ray tracing is increasingly utilized in wireless system simulations to estimate channel paths. In large-scale simulations with complex environments, ray tracing at high resolution can be computationally demanding. To reduce the computation, this paper presents a novel method for conducting ray tracing at a coarse set of reference points and interpolating the channels at other locations. The key insight is to interpolate the images of reflected points. In addition to the computational savings, the method directly captures the spherical nature of each wavefront enabling fast and accurate computation of channels using line-of-sight MIMO and other wide aperture techniques. Through empirical validation and comparison with exhaustive ray tracing, we demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of our approach in achieving high-fidelity channel predictions with reduced computational resources.</description>

      <title>A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Diffusion Sampling for Predictive Control in Offline Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline decision-making via diffusion models often produces trajectories that are misaligned with system dynamics, limiting their reliability for control. We propose Model Predictive Diffuser (MPDiffuser), a compositional diffusion framework that combines a diffusion planner with a dynamics diffusion model to generate task-aligned and dynamically plausible trajectories. MPDiffuser interleaves planner and dynamics updates during sampling, progressively correcting feasibility while preserving task intent. A lightweight ranking module then selects trajectories that best satisfy task objectives. The compositional design improves sample efficiency and adaptability by enabling the dynamics model to leverage diverse and previously unseen data independently of the planner. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over prior diffusion-based methods on unconstrained (D4RL) and constrained (DSRL) benchmarks, and validate practicality through deployment on a real quadrupedal robot.</description>

      <title>SmartMeterFM: Unifying Smart Meter Data Generative Tasks Using Flow Matching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.</description>
