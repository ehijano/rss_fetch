      <title>Global Coronal Plasma Diagnostics Based on Multi-slit EUV Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-disk spectroscopic observations of the solar corona are highly desired to forecast solar eruptions and their impact on planets and to uncover the origin of solar wind. In this paper, we introduce a new multi-slit design (5 slits) to obtain extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra simultaneously. The selected spectrometer wavelength range (184-197 \r{A}) contains several bright EUV lines that can be used for spectral diagnostics. The multi-slit approach offers an unprecedented way to efficiently obtain the global spectral data but the ambiguity from different slits should be resolved. Using a numerical simulation of the global corona, we primarily concentrate on the optimization of the disambiguation process, with the objective of extracting decomposed spectral information of six primary lines. This subsequently facilitates a comprehensive series of plasma diagnostics, including density (Fe XII 195.12/186.89 \r{A}), Doppler velocity (Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}), line width (Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}) and temperature diagnostics (Fe VIII 185.21 \r{A}, Fe X 184.54 \r{A}, Fe XI 188.22 \r{A}, Fe XII 193.51 \r{A}). We find a good agreement between the forward modeling parameters and the inverted results at the initial eruption stage of a coronal mass ejection, indicating the robustness of the decomposition method and its immense potential for global monitoring of the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Detecting stellar flares in photometric data using hidden Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hidden Markov model (HMM) for discovering stellar flares in light curve data of stars. HMMs provide a framework to model time series data that are not stationary; they allow for systems to be in different states at different times and consider the probabilities that describe the switching dynamics between states. In the context of stellar flares discovery, we exploit the HMM framework by allowing the light curve of a star to be in one of three states at any given time step: Quiet, Firing, or Decaying. This three state HMM formulation is designed to enable straightforward identification of stellar flares, their duration, and associated uncertainty. This is crucial for estimating the flare's energy, and is useful for studies of stellar flare energy distributions. We combine our HMM with a celerite model that accounts for quasi periodic stellar oscillations. Through an injection recovery experiment, we demonstrate and evaluate the ability of our method to detect and characterize flares in stellar time series. We also show that the proposed HMM flags fainter and lower energy flares more easily than traditional sigma clipping methods. Lastly, we visually demonstrate that simultaneously conducting detrending and flare detection can mitigate biased estimations arising in multistage modelling approaches. Thus, this method paves a new way to calculating stellar flare energy. We conclude with an example application to one star observed by TESS, showing how the HMM compares with sigma clipping when using real data.</description>

      <title>Generic low-atmosphere signatures of swirled-anemone jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets are collimated plasma flows moving along magnetic field lines and accelerated at low altitude following magnetic reconnection. Several of them originate from anemone-shaped low-lying arcades and the most impulsive ones tend to be relatively wider and display untwisting motions. We aim to establish typical behaviours and observational signatures in the low atmosphere that can occur in response to the coronal development of such impulsive jets. We analysed an observed solar jet associated with a circular flare ribbon, using high-resolution observations from SST coordinated with IRIS and SDO. We related specifically identified features with those developing in a generic 3D line-tied numerical simulation of reconnection driven jets, performed with the ARMS code. We identified three features in the SST observations: the formation of a hook along the circular ribbon, the gradual widening of the jet through the apparent displacement of its kinked edge towards, and not away from the presumed reconnection site, and the falling back of some of the jet plasma towards a footpoint offset from that of the jet itself. The 3D numerical simulation naturally accounts for these features which were not imposed a priori. Our analyses allow to interpret them in the context of the 3D geometry of the asymmetric swirled anemone loops and their sequences of reconnection with ambient coronal loops. Given the relatively-simple conditions in which the observed jet occurred, together with the generic nature of the simulation that comprised minimum assumptions, we predict that the specific features that we identified and interpreted are probably typical of every impulsive jet</description>

      <title>Atmospheric parameters and abundances of cool red giant stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the atmospheric parameters of stars on the top of the RGB is essential to reveal the chemical composition of the Milky Way, as they can be used to probe the farthest parts of our Galaxy. Our goal is to determine the chemical composition of 21 RGB stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;4200$K selected from the APOGEE-2 DR17 database using new observations carried out with the spectrograph mounted on the 1-m telescope of the Hungarian Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory and the SONG spectrograph (R=77000) on the Hertzsprung SONG telescope in the 4500$-$5800\r{A} wavelength range. This is the first time the spectrograph (R=18000) on the 1-m telescope at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory was used to measure the abundances of stars. We created a new LTE spectral library using MARCS model atmospheres and SYNSPEC by including the line list of 23 molecules to determine atmospheric parameters ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe]) and abundances of Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Ni with FERRE. The resulting parameters were compared to that of APOGEE. We found a good agreement in general, the average difference is $-$11.2K in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, 0.11dex in $\log g$, 0.10dex in [Fe/H], and $-$0.01dex in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Our analysis successfully demonstrates the ability of the spectrograph at Piszk\'estet\H{o} Observatory to reliably measure the abundance of bright stars.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Stellar Flare Models of Deep Atmospheric Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical flares have been observed from magnetically active stars for many decades; unsurprisingly, the spectra and temporal evolution are complicated. For example, the shortcomings of optically thin, static slab models have long been recognized when confronted with the observations. A less incorrect -- but equally simple -- phenomenological $T \approx 9000$ K blackbody model has instead been widely adopted in the absence of realistic (i.e., observationally-tested) time-dependent, atmospheric models that are readily available. We use the RADYN code to calculate a grid of 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models that are driven by short pulses of electron-beam heating. The flare heating rates in the low atmosphere vary over many orders of magnitude in the grid, and we show that the models with high-energy electron beams compare well to the global trends in flux ratios from impulsive-phase stellar flare, optical spectra. The models also match detailed spectral line shape properties. We find that the pressure broadening and optical depths account for the broad components of the hydrogen Balmer $\gamma$ lines in a powerful flare with echelle spectra. The self-consistent formation of the wings and nearby continuum level provide insight into how high-energy electron beam heating evolves from the impulsive to the gradual decay phase in white-light stellar flares. The grid is publicly available, and we discuss possible applications.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Optical and Infrared Nature of MAXI J0709-159: Implications for High-Mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study (Bhattacharyya et al., 2022), HD~54786, the optical counterpart of the MAXI J0709-159 system, was identified to be an evolved star, departing from the main sequence, based on comparisons with non-X-ray binary systems. In this paper, using color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analysis for High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) and statistical t-tests, we found evidence supporting HD 54786's potential membership in both Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) and supergaint X-ray binaries (SgXBs) populations of HMXBs. Hence, our study points towards dual optical characteristics of HD~54786, as an X-ray binary star and also belonging to a distinct evolutionary phase from BeXRB towards SgXB. Our further analysis suggests that MAXI J0709-159, associated with HD 54786, exhibits low-level activity during the current epoch and possesses a limited amount of circumstellar material. Although similarities with the previously studied BeXRB system LSI +61$^{\circ}$ 235 (Coe et al., 1994) are noted, continued monitoring and data collection are essential to fully comprehend the complexities of MAXI J0709-159 and its evolutionary trajectory within the realm of HMXBs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Detached Eclipsing Binary Systems from TESS Observations: Insights into OBA-type Systems and Orbital Circularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents photometric solutions for a carefully selected sample of 181 detached eclipsing binary systems recently observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Our findings contribute to discussions about OBA-type systems and the orbital circularization influenced by tidal interactions. The results encompass crucial parameters, including the sum of radii fraction ($r_{\rm a}\,+\,r_{\rm b}$), radii ratio ($k$), orbital inclination ($i$), surface brightness ratio ($J$), and combinations of the longitude of the periastron and orbital eccentricity ($e\,\sin\,\omega$ and $e\,\cos\,\omega$). Geometric light curve fitting is performed using version 43 of the {\sc jktebop} code, serving as the primary tool for determining orbital elements and physical ratios. Careful uncertainty estimates for these findings are derived through bootstrap simulations. This work introduces unprecedented photometric solutions for 172 well-detached eclipsing systems, while the results for the remaining nine systems exhibit excellent agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Additionally, a critical primary radius fraction ($R_{\rm a}/a$) of 0.266 is identified for our sample of radiative envelope stars, consistent with observational and theoretical findings in the literature. Finally, we determine a circularization period of 5.762 days based on a function from the literature, revealing a discrepancy with Zahn's theory for hot stars.</description>

      <title>Is climate variability the result of frequency modulation by the solar cycle? Evidence from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Australian climate, Central England Temperature, and reconstructed solar activity and climate records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and assessing the Sun climate connection.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Tidal Migration of Hot Jupiters on the Rotation of Sun-like Main-sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal interactions of planets affect the stellar evolutionary status and the constraint of their physical parameters by gyrochronology. In this work, we incorporate the tidal interaction and magnetic braking of the stellar wind into MESA and calculate a large grid of 25000 models, covering planets with masses of 0.1-13.0$\,$$M_{\mathrm{J}}$ with different orbital distances that orbit late-type stars of different metallicities. We also explore the effect of different stellar initial rotations on the tidal interactions. Our results show that in the case of tidal inward migration, the stellar rotation periods are always lower than that of the star without planet before the planet is engulfed and the difference in the rotation period of its host star always increases with time. After the planet is engulfed, the stellar rotation periods are still lower than that of star without planet, but the difference of periods can be quickly eliminated if the star has a thick convective envelope(smaller mass and larger metallicity), regardless of the mass of the planet and the initial rotation period of the star. In the case of stars with thinner convective envelopes(larger mass and smaller metallicity), the stars will be spined up and remain the faster rotation in a long time. Meanwhile, the planet is easily swallowed and the period differences are large if the initial rotation period of its host star is higher. Final, we also study the evolution of WASP-19 and estimate the range of tidal quality parameter $Q'_{*} = (4.6 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{6}$ and initial semi-major axis as $(0.035 \pm 0.004)$$\,$au.</description>

      <title>New Evidence of Binarity in Young {\alpha}-Rich Turn-off and Subgiant Stars: Fast Rotation and Strong Magnetic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young {\alpha}-rich (YAR) stars within the old Galactic thick disk exhibit a dual characteristic of relative youth determined with asteroseismology and abundance enhancement in {\alpha} elements measured from high-resolution spectroscopy. The youth origin of YAR stars has been proposed to be binary evolution via mass transfer or stellar mergers. If that is the case, YAR stars should spin rapidly and thus be magnetically active, because they are mass and angular momentum gainers. In this study, to seek this binary footprint we select YAR stars on the main-sequence turn-off or the subgiant branch (MSTO-SGB) from APOGEE DR17, whose ages and projected rotation velocities (vsini) can be precisely measured. With APOGEE vsini and LAMOST spectra, we find that YAR stars are indeed fast rotators and magnetically active. In addition, we observe low [C/N] ratios and high Gaia RUWE in some YAR stars, suggesting that these MSTO-SGB stars probably have experienced mass transfer from red-giant companions. Our findings underscore that magnetic activity can serve as a valuable tool for probing the binary evolution for other chemically peculiar stars, such as red giants with lithium anomalies and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of dust grains and protoplanetary disks II: structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks; an analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous study (Tsukamoto {\it et al.} 2023), we investigated formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks with 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations considering dust growth, and found that the modified equations of the conventional steady accretion disk model which consider the magnetic braking, { dust growth} and ambipolar diffusion reproduce the disk structure obtained from simulations very well. In this paper, as a sequel of the our previous study, we analytically investigate the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks corresponding to Class 0/I young stellar objects using the modified steady accretion disk model combining an analytical model of envelope accretion. We estimate that the disk radius is several AU at disk formation epoch and increases to several 100 AU at the end of the accretion phase. The disk mass is estimated to be $0.01 M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm disk} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$ for a disk with radius of several 10 AU and mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm disk} \sim 10^{-6} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$. We also found that, with typical disk ionization rates and moderate mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm disk}\gtrsim10^{-8} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$), magneto-rotational instability is suppressed in the disk because of low plasma $\beta$ and efficient ambipolar diffusion. We argue that the radial profile of specific angular momentum (or rotational velocity) at the disk outer edge should be continuously connected to that of the envelope if the disk evolves by magnetic braking, and should be discontinuous if the disk evolves by internal angular momentum transport process such as gravitational instability or magneto-rotational instability. Future detailed observations of the specific angular momentum profile around the disk outer edge are important for understanding the angular momentum transport mechanism of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Intrinsic Stellar Noise with Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and Chromospheric Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing intrinsic stellar photometric noise induced by stellar astrophysics, such as stellar activity, granulation, and oscillations, is of crucial importance for detecting transiting exoplanets. In this study, we investigate the relation between the intrinsic stellar photometric noise, as quantified by the Kepler rrmsCDPP measurement, and the level of stellar chromospheric activity, as indicated by the S-index of Ca II HK lines derived from the LAMOST spectra. Our results reveal a clear positive correlation between S-index and rrmsCDPP, and the correlation becomes more significant at higher activity levels and on longer timescales. We have therefore built an empirical relation between rrmsCDPP and S-index as well as Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and apparent magnitude with the XGBoost regression algorithm, using the LAMOST-Kepler common star sample as the training set. This method achieves a precision of ~20 ppm for inferring the intrinsic noise from the S-index and other stellar labels on a 6-hour integration duration. We have applied this empirical relation to the full LAMOST DR7 spectra database, and obtained the intrinsic noise predictions for 1,358,275 stars. The resultant catalog is publicly available and expected to be valuable for optimizing target selection for future exoplanet-hunting space missions, such as the Earth 2.0 mission.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>Investigation of [KSF2015] 1381-19L, a WC9-type star in the high extinction Galactic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a multi-wavelength study of the Wolf Rayet (WR) star: [KSF2015] 1381-19L, which is located in the solar metallicity region (Z=0.014) of the Milky Way Galaxy, strongly obscured by the interstellar dust. We perform a detailed characterization of the stellar atmosphere by fitting the spectral emission lines observed in the Optical and Near-InfraRed (NIR) bands, using CMFGEN. The best-fitted spectroscopic model indicates a highly luminous ($10^{5.89}L_{\odot}$) star with a larger radius ($15\,R_{\odot}$) and effective temperature, wind terminal velocity, and chemical composition similar to that of Galactic WC9-dusty (WC9d)-type stars. The atmospheric ionization structure shows coexisting ionization states of different elements, simultaneously affecting the opacity and thermal electron balance. Fitting of the spectral energy data (SED) reveals high interstellar optical extinction ($A_{V}=$ 8.87) while the IR extinction is found to be comparatively lower ($A_{K_{s}}=$ 0.98). We do not detect any excess emission at near-IR wavelengths due to dust. Upon comparison of our results with the GENEVA single star evolutionary models (Z=0.014), we identify the best possible progenitors ( a rotating star of $67\,M_{\odot}$ and a non-rotating star of $90\,M_{\odot}$).</description>

      <title>A Joint Microwave and Hard X-Ray Study Towards Understanding the Transport of Accelerated Electrons during an Eruptive Solar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard flare model, despite its success, is limited in comprehensively explaining the various processes involving nonthermal particles. One such missing ingredient is a detailed understanding of the various processes involved during the transport of accelerated electrons from their site of acceleration to different parts of the flare region. Here we use simultaneous radio and X-ray observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) onboard the Solar Orbiter (SolO), respectively, from two distinct viewing perspectives to study the electron transport processes. Through detailed spectral modeling of the coronal source using radio data and footpoint sources using X-ray spectra, we compare the nonthermal electron distribution at the coronal and footpoint sources. We find that the flux of nonthermal electrons precipitated at the footpoint is an order of magnitude greater than that trapped in the looptop, consistent with earlier works which primarily used X-ray for their studies. In addition, we find that the electron spectral indices obtained from X-ray footpoints is significantly softer than the spectral hardness of the nonthermal electron distribution in the corona. We interpret these differences based on transport effects and the difference in sensitivity of microwave and X-ray observations to different regimes of electron energies. Such an understanding is crucial for leveraging different diagnostic methods of nonthermal electrons simultaneously to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the electron acceleration and transport processes of solar flares.</description>

      <title>Thirteen New M Dwarf + T Dwarf Pairs Identified with WISE/NEOWISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 13 new widely separated T dwarf companions to M dwarf primaries, identified using WISE/NEOWISE data by the CatWISE and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 projects. This sample represents a $\sim$60% increase in the number of known M+T systems, and allows us to probe the most extreme products of binary/planetary system formation, a discovery space made available by the CatWISE2020 catalog and the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 effort. Highlights among the sample are WISEP J075108.79-763449.6, a previously known T9 thought to be old due to its SED, which we now find is part of a common-proper-motion pair with L 34-26 A, a well studied young M3 V star within 10 pc of the Sun; CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 B and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 B, two T8 dwarfs possibly associated with the very fast-rotating M4 V stars CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 A and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 A; and UCAC3 52-1038 B, which is among the widest late T companions to main sequence stars, with a projected separation of $\sim$7100 au. The new benchmarks presented here are prime $JWST$ targets, and can help us place strong constraints on formation and evolution theory of substellar objects as well as on atmospheric models for these cold exoplanet analogs.</description>

      <title>On the incidence rate of RR Lyrae stars with non-radial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the recent years, additional low-amplitude non-radial modes were detected in many of the first-overtone RR Lyrae stars. These non-radial modes form a characteristic period ratio with the dominant first-overtone mode of around 0.61. The incidence rate of this phenomenon changes from population to population. It is also strongly dependent on the quality of the analyzed data. Current models explaining these additional signals involve non-radial modes of degrees 8 and 9. Using synthetic horizontal branch populations, we investigate the incidence rate of first-overtone RR Lyrae stars with non-radial modes depending on the population properties, i.e., ages and metallicities. We compare our results with the observed results for globular clusters and the numerous collection of field first-overtone RR Lyrae stars to test the predictions of the models. We used synthetic horizontal branches combined with pulsation models to predict how the incidence rate would depend on the age and metallicity of the population. To test whether the results based on synthetic horizontal branches are realistic, we compared them to incidence rates observed by TESS in first-overtone field RR Lyrae stars, using photometric metallicity values from a newly established calibration for TESS. The analysis of synthetic horizontal branches showed that the incidence rate decreases with decreasing metallicity. We inferred photometric metallicity for RR Lyrae stars observed by TESS and showed that the theoretical predictions are in agreement with the observations. Using the same method, we also conclude that the metallicity distribution of RR Lyrae stars showing an additional mode with a period-ratio around $0.68$ appears to be different from that of both all first-overtone stars and those showing additional non-radial modes.</description>

      <title>Observational characterisation of large-scale transport and horizontal turbulent diffusivity in the quiet Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun is a magnetic star, and the only spatio-temporally resolved astrophysical system displaying turbulent MHD thermal convection. This makes it a privileged object of study to understand fluid turbulence in extreme regimes and its interactions with magnetic fields. Global analyses of high-resolution solar observations provided by the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory can shed light on the physical processes underlying large-scale emergent phenomena such as the solar dynamo cycle. Combining a Coherent Structure Tracking reconstruction of photospheric flows, based on photometric data, and a statistical analysis of virtual passive tracers trajectories advected by these flows, we characterise one of the most important such processes, turbulent diffusion, over an unprecedentedly long monitoring period of 6 consecutive days of a significant fraction of the solar disc. We first confirm, and provide a new global view of the emergence of a remarkable dynamical pattern of Lagrangian Coherent Structures tiling the entire surface. These structures act as transport barriers on the time and spatial scale of supergranulation and, by transiently accumulating particles and magnetic fields, regulate large-scale turbulent surface diffusion. We then further statistically characterise the turbulent transport regime using two different methods, and obtain an effective horizontal turbulent diffusivity $D=2-3\times10^8~\mathrm{m}^2~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ on the longest timescales probed. This estimate is consistent with the transport coefficients required in large-scale mean-field solar dynamo models, and is in broad agreement with the results of global simulations. Our analysis may also have implications for understanding the connections between solar-surface, coronal and solar-wind dynamics, and provides valuable lessons to characterise turbulent transport in other, unresolved turbulent astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>A New Computational Method for Energetic Particle Acceleration and Transport with its Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a new computational method to explore astrophysical and heliophysical phenomena, especially those considerably influenced by non-thermal energetic particles. This novel approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating the non-thermal fluid pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the non-thermal fluid is evaluated from the energetic particle distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, which is solved using stochastic differential equations. We implement this method in the HOW-MHD code (Seo \&amp; Ryu 2023), which achieves 5th-order accuracy. We find that without spatial diffusion, the method accurately reproduces the Riemann solution in the hydrodynamic shock tube test when including the non-thermal pressure. Solving Parker's transport equation allows the determination of pressure terms for both relativistic and non-relativistic non-thermal fluids with adiabatic indices $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=4/3$ and $\gamma_{\rm{NT}}=5/3$, respectively. The method also successfully replicates the Magnetohydrodynamic shock tube test with non-thermal pressure, successfully resolving the discontinuities within a few cells. Introducing spatial diffusion of non-thermal particles leads to marginal changes in the shock but smooths the contact discontinuity. Importantly, this method successfully simulates the energy spectrum of the non-thermal particles accelerated through shock, which includes feedback from the non-thermal population. These results demonstrate that this method is very powerful for studying particle acceleration when a significant portion of the plasma energy is taken by energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope \mbox{(AtLAST)} Science: Probing the Transient and Time-variable Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of transient and variable events, including novae, active galactic nuclei, and black hole binaries, has historically been a fruitful path for elucidating the evolutionary mechanisms of our universe. The study of such events in the millimeter and submillimeter is, however, still in its infancy. Submillimeter observations probe a variety of materials, such as optically thick dust, which are hard to study in other wavelengths. Submillimeter observations are sensitive to a number of emission mechanisms, from the aforementioned cold dust, to hot free-free emission, and synchrotron emission from energetic particles. Study of these phenomena has been hampered by a lack of prompt, high sensitivity submillimeter follow-up, as well as by a lack of high-sky-coverage submillimeter surveys. In this paper, we describe how the proposed Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) could fill in these gaps in our understanding of the transient universe. We discuss a number of science cases that would benefit from AtLAST observations, and detail how AtLAST is uniquely suited to contributing to them. In particular, AtLAST's large field of view will enable serendipitous detections of transient events, while its anticipated ability to get on source quickly and observe simultaneously in multiple bands make it also ideally suited for transient follow-up. We make theoretical predictions for the instrumental and observatory properties required to significantly contribute to these science cases, and compare them to the projected AtLAST capabilities. Finally, we consider the unique ways in which transient science cases constrain the observational strategies of AtLAST, and make prescriptions for how AtLAST should observe in order to maximize its transient science output without impinging on other science cases.</description>

      <title>Age analysis of extrasolar planets: Insight from stellar isochrone models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from stellar kinematics and galactic chemical evolution (GCE) suggesting that giant planets (M$_{P}\geq$0.3$M_{J}$) are relatively young compared to the most commonly occurring population of small planets (M$_{P} &lt;$0.3$M_{J}$). To further test the validity of these results, we analyzed the ages for a large number of 2336 exoplanet hosting stars determined using three different but well-established isochrone fitting models, namely, PARSEC, MIST, and Yonsei Yale (YY). As input parameters, we used Gaia DR3 parallaxes, magnitudes, and photometric temperature, as well as spectroscopically determined more accurate temperatures and metallicities from the Sweet Catalog. Our analysis suggests that $\sim$~50$\%$ to 70$\%$ of stars with planets are younger than the sun. We also find that, among the confirmed exoplanetary systems, stars hosting giant planets are even younger compared to small planet hosts. The median age of $\sim$~2.61 to 3.48~Gyr estimated for the giant planet-hosting stars (depending on the model input parameters) suggests that the later chemical enrichment of the galaxy by the iron-peak elements, largely produced from Type Ia supernovae, may have paved the way for the formation of gas giants. Furthermore, within the giant planet population itself, stars hosting hot Jupiters (orbital period $\le$10 days) are found to be younger compared to the stellar hosts of cool and warm Jupiters (orbital period $&gt;$10 days), implying that hot Jupiters could be the youngest systems to emerge in the progression of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Charged analog of anisotropic dark energy star in Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark energy is one of the potential strategies for preventing compact objects from gravitationally collapsing into singularities. Because it is the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe, it has the greatest impact on the cosmos. Thus, it is plausible that dark energy will interact with any stellar object that is compact in the universe [\textit{Phys. Rev. D} \textbf{103}, 084042 (2021)]. Our main goal in this work is to create a simplified model, in the Rastall gravitational framework, of a charged strange star coupled to anisotropic dark energy in Krori-Barua spacetime [\textit{J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.} \textbf{8}:508, 1975]. Here, we consider a specific strange star object, Her X-1, with observed values of mass $=(0.85 \pm 0.15)M_{\odot}$ and radius $= 8.1_{-0.41}^{+0.41}$ km., so that we can develop our model. In this context, we began by modeling dark energy using the equation of state (EoS), in which the dark energy density is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter-energy density. The Darmois-Israel condition has been used to calculate the unknown constants that are present in the metric. We perform a detailed analysis of the model's physical properties, including the mass-radius relation, pressure, density, metric function, and dark energy parameters, by varying the Rastall coupling parameter. We also examine the stability and force equilibrium of our proposed stellar configuration. Following a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we discovered that our suggested model is both singularity-free and meets all stability requirements needed to be a stable, physically reasonable stellar model.</description>

      <title>Well behaved class of Heintzmann's solution within $f(R,\,T)$ framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to develop a well-behaved class of Heintzmann IIa [{\em H. Heintzmann, Z. Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)}] solution in the context of $f(R,\, T)$ gravity. In the $f(R, T)$ framework, the gravitational action includes both the Ricci scalar ($R$) and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor ($T$). We chose a particular $f(R,\,T)$ model s.t. $f(R,\,T) = R+2 \chi T$, where $\chi$ is known as the coupling parameter. This solution describes a novel isotropic compact fluid sphere with positively finite central pressure and density in this extended theory of gravity. The results obtained analytically are better described by graphical representations of the physical parameters for various values of the coupling parameter $\chi$. The solution for a specific compact object, Vela X-1, with radius $\mathfrak{R} = 9.56_{-0.08}^{+0.08}$ km and mass $\mathcal{M} = 1.77 \pm 0.08~\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ [{\em M. L. Rawls et al. ApJ, 730, 25 (2011)}], is shown here. We analyze the fundamental physical attributes of the star, which reveals the influence of the coupling parameter $\chi$ on the values of substance parameters. This helps us to make a fruitful comparison of this modified $f(R,\, T)$ gravity with the standard GR and notice that it holds good for stable compact objects. In this framework, the star under our consideration exhibits a stable structure consistent with the Heintzmann IIa {\em ansatz}. From all of our obtained graphical and numerical results, we can ultimately conclude that our reported model is physically admissible and satisfies all the physical criteria for an acceptable model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 36 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.</description>

Abstract: The u band magnitude is vital for determining stellar parameters and investigating specific astronomical objects. However, flux calibration in the u band for stars in the Galactic disk presents significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive re-calibration of $u$-band photometric magnitudes of the VPHAS+ Data Release 4 (DR4), employing the Stellar Colour Regression (SCR) technique. By leveraging the expansive set of XP spectra and $G_{\rm BP}$ photometry from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), as well as the individual stellar extinction values provided by the literature, we have obtained precise model magnitudes of nearly 3 million stars. Our analysis identifies systematic magnitude offsets that exhibit a standard deviation of 0.063 mag across different observational visits, 0.022 mag between various CCDs, and 0.009 mag within pixel bins. We have implemented precise corrections for these observational visits, CCD chips, and pixel bins-dependent magnitude offsets. These corrections have led to a reduction in the standard deviation between the observed magnitudes and the model magnitudes from 0.088 mag to 0.065 mag, ensuring that the calibrated magnitudes are independent of stellar magnitude, colour, and extinction. The enhanced precision of these magnitudes substantially improves the quality of astrophysical research and offers substantial potential for furthering our understanding of stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Extraction of YSO Cores and Active Regions near Star-forming Site AFGL 5157</title>

Abstract: We have carried out a quantitative analysis of the $1^{\circ} \times 1^{\circ}$ region near star-forming site AFGL 5157 using 'Minimal Spanning Tree' (MST). The analysis reveals that this region consists of five major clusters. The cluster radii of the cores and active regions were found to be varying between 0.75-2.62 pc and 2.77-4.58 pc, respectively, for these regions, while the aspect ratio varies between 0.71 to 7.17. This hints towards the clumpy as well as elongated clusters in the region. We calculated structure parameter Q for each region which varies between 0.41-0.62 and 0.23-0.81 for the cores and ARs, respectively. This shows the existence of fractal distribution in all the cores and ARs except the core of the [HKS2019] E70 bubble.</description>

      <title>X-shooter spectroscopy of Liller1 giant stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive chemical study of a representative sample of 27 luminous red giant branch (RGB) stars belonging to Liller 1, a complex stellar system in the Galactic bulge. This study is based on medium-resolution near-infrared spectra acquired with X-shooter at the Very Large Telescope. We found a subpopulation counting 22 stars with subsolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;=-0.31\pm0.02$ and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.08 dex) and with enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that likely formed early and quickly from gas that was mainly enriched by type II supernovae, and a metal-rich population counting 5 stars with supersolar metallicity ($&lt;$[Fe/H]$&gt;$=+0.22$\pm$0.03 and 1$\sigma$ dispersion of 0.06 dex) and roughly solar-scaled [$\alpha$/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [K/Fe] that formed at later epochs from gas that was also enriched by type Ia supernovae. Moreover, both subpopulations show enhanced [Na/Fe], as in the bulge field, about solar-scaled [V/Fe], and depletion of [C/Fe] and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C with respect to the solar values. This indicates that mixing and extra-mixing processes during the RGB evolution also occur at very high metallicities. Notably, no evidence of a Na-O anticorrelation, which is considered the fingerprint of genuine globular clusters, has been found. This challenges any formation scenarios that invoke the accretion of a molecular cloud or an additional stellar system onto a genuine globular cluster. The results of this study underline the strong chemical similarity between Liller 1 and Terzan 5 and support the hypothesis that these complex stellar systems might be fossil fragments of the epoch of Galactic bulge formation.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look into the Interaction of Exoplanets Magnetosphere with Stellar Winds using MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous numerical studies have been carried out in recent years that simulate different aspects of exoplanets' magnetosphere and stellar winds. These studies have focused primarily on hot Jupiters with sun-like stars. This study addresses the challenges inherent in utilizing existing MHD codes to model hot Jupiter-star systems. Due to the scaling of the system and the assumption of a uniformly flowing stellar wind at the outer boundary of the simulation, MHD codes necessitate a minimum distance of greater than 0.4 au for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a sun-like star to avoid substantial violations of the code's assumptions. Additionally, employing the GAMERA (Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications) MHD code, we simulate star-planet interactions considering various stellar types (Sun-like and M Dwarf stars) with both Jupiter-like and Earth-like planets positioned at varying orbital distances. Furthermore, we explore the impact of tidal locking on the total power within the magnetosphere-ionosphere systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mass Segregation of the Binary Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6819</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 &lt; G &lt; 19.5 containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q &gt; 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.</description>

      <title>The formation of the magnetic symbiotic star FN Sgr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To shed light on the origin of magnetic symbiotic stars, we investigated the system FN Sgr in detail. We searched for a reasonable formation pathway to explain its stellar and binary parameters including the magnetic field of the accreting white dwarf. We used the MESA code to carry out pre-CE and post-CE binary evolution and determined the outcome of CE evolution assuming the energy formalism. For the origin and evolution of the white dwarf magnetic field, we adopted the crystallization scenario. We found that FN Sgr can be explained as follows. First, a non-magnetic white dwarf is formed through CE evolution. Later, during post-CE evolution, the white dwarf starts to crystallize and a weak magnetic field is generated. After a few hundred Myr, the magnetic field penetrates the white dwarf surface and becomes detectable. Meanwhile, its companion evolves and becomes an evolved red giant. Subsequently, the white dwarf accretes part of the angular momentum from the red giant stellar winds. As a result, the white dwarf spin period decreases and its magnetic field reaches super-equipartition, getting amplified due to a rotation- and crystallization-driven dynamo. The binary then evolves into a symbiotic star, with a magnetic white dwarf accreting from an evolved red giant through atmospheric Roche-lobe overflow. We conclude that the rotation- and crystallization-driven dynamo scenario, or any age-dependent scenario, can explain the origin of magnetic symbiotic stars reasonably well. This adds another piece to the pile of evidence supporting this scenario. If our formation channel is correct, our findings suggest that white dwarfs in most symbiotic stars formed through CE evolution might be magnetic, provided that the red giant has spent &gt;3 Gyr as a main-sequence star.</description>

      <title>Plasma motions and compressive wave energetics in the solar corona and solar wind from radio wave scattering observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting properties of solar bursts as well as sources viewed through the turbulent solar atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model from the kinetic scattering theory for solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The inferred velocities are consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities also appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.</description>

      <title>Reconnaissance ultracool spectra in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Euclid will carry out a deep survey benefiting the discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), especially in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), which the telescope will scan repeatedly throughout its mission. The photometric and spectroscopic standards in the EDFs are important benchmarks, crucial for the classification and characterisation of new UCD discoveries and for the calibration of the mission itself. Aims. We aim to provide a list of photometric UCD candidates and collect near-infrared reconnaissance spectra for M, L, and T-type UCDs in the EDFs as future Euclid UCD references. Methods. In EDF North, we cross-matched public optical and infrared surveys with certain photometric criteria to select UCDs. In EDF Fornax and EDF South, we used photometrically classified samples from the literature. We also include UCDs identified by Gaia DR2. We selected 7 UCD targets with different spectral types from the lists and obtained low-resolution 0.9-2.5 {\mu}m spectra of them using GTC/EMIR and the VLT/X-shooter. We also selected a young, bright L dwarf near EDF Fornax to test the coherence of these two facilities. We included an extra T dwarf in EDF North with its published J-band spectrum. Results. We retrieved a list of 81 (49, 231) M, 8 (29, 115) L, and 1 (0, 2) T dwarf candidates in EDF North, Fornax, and South, respectively. They are provided to guide future UCD discoveries and characterisations by Euclid. In total, we collected near-infrared spectra for 9 UCDs, including 2 M types, 3 L types, and 4 T types in or close to the 3 EDFs. The Euclidised spectra show consistency in their spectral classification, which demonstrates that slitless Euclid spectroscopy will recover the spectral types with high fidelity for UCDs, both in the EDFs and in the wide survey. We also demonstrate that Euclid will be able to distinguish different age groups of UCDs.</description>

      <title>Plasma Waves near the Electron Cyclotron Frequency in the near-Sun Solar Wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data from the first two orbits of the Sun by Parker Solar Probe reveal that the solar wind sunward of 50 solar radii is replete with plasma waves and instabilities. One of the most prominent plasma wave power enhancements in this region appears near the electron cyclotron frequency (f_ce). Most of this wave power is concentrated in electric field fluctuations near 0.7 f_ce and f_ce, with strong harmonics of both frequencies extending above f_ce. At least two distinct, often concurrent, wave modes are observed, preliminarily identified as electrostatic whistler-mode waves and electron Bernstein waves. Wave intervals range in duration from a few seconds to hours. Both the amplitudes and number of detections of these near-f_ce waves increase significantly with decreasing distance to the Sun, suggesting that they play an important role in the evolution of electron populations in the near-Sun solar wind. Correlations are found between the detection of these waves and properties of solar wind electron populations, including electron core drift, implying that these waves play a role in regulating the heat flux carried by solar wind electrons. Observation of these near-f_ce waves is found to be strongly correlated with near-radial solar wind magnetic field configurations with low levels of magnetic turbulence. A scenario for the growth of these waves is presented which implies that regions of low-turbulence near-radial magnetic field are a prominent feature of solar wind structure near the Sun.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic reconnection occurs ubiquitously in the universe and is often invoked to explain fast energy release and particle acceleration in high-energy astrophysics. The study of relativistic magnetic reconnection in the magnetically dominated regime has surged over the past two decades, revealing the physics of fast magnetic reconnection and nonthermal particle acceleration. Here we review these recent progresses, including the magnetohydrodynamic and collisionless reconnection dynamics as well as particle energization. The insights in astrophysical reconnection strongly connect to the development of magnetic reconnection in other areas, and further communication is greatly desired. We also provide a summary and discussion of key physics processes and frontier problems, toward a better understanding to the roles of magnetic reconnection in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Detecting Detached Black Hole binaries through Photometric Variability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between the properties of black holes (BHs) and their progenitors is interesting in many branches of astrophysics. Discovering BHs in detached orbits with luminous companions (LCs) promises to help create this map since the LC and BH progenitor are expected to have the same metallicity and formation time. We explore the possibility of detecting BH-LC binaries in detached orbits using photometric variations of the LC flux, induced by tidal ellipsoidal variation, relativistic beaming, and self-lensing. We create realistic present-day populations of detached BH-LC binaries in the Milky Way (MW) using binary population synthesis where we adopt observationally motivated initial stellar and binary properties, star formation history and present-day distribution of these sources in the MW based on detailed cosmological simulations. We test detectability of these sources via photometric variability by Gaia and TESS missions by incorporating their respective detailed detection biases as well as interstellar extinction. We find that Gaia (TESS) is expected to resolve ~700-1500 (~100-400) detached BH-LC binaries depending on the photometric precision and details of supernova physics. We find that ~369 BH-LC binaries would be common both in Gaia and TESS. Moreover, between ~80-270 (~70-290) of these BH-LC binaries can be further characterised using Gaia's radial velocity (astrometry) measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass table in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the PC-PK1 density functional has been established for even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le120$, extended from the previous work for even-even nuclei [Zhang $\it{et al.}$ (DRHBc Mass Table Collaboration), At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 144, 101488 (2022)]. The calculated binding energies, two-nucleon and one-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square (rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared with available experimental data. A total of 4829 even-$Z$ nuclei are predicted to be bound, with an rms deviation of 1.477 MeV from the 1244 mass data. Good agreement with the available experimental odd-even mass differences, $\alpha$ decay energies, and charge radii is also achieved. The description accuracy for nuclear masses and nucleon separation energies as well as the prediction for drip lines is compared with the results obtained from other relativistic and nonrelativistic density functional. The comparison shows that the DRHBc theory with PC-PK1 provides an excellent microscopic description for the masses of even-$Z$ nuclei. The systematics of the nucleon separation energies, odd-even mass differences, pairing energies, two-nucleon gaps, $\alpha$ decay energies, rms radii, quadrupole deformations, potential energy curves, neutron density distributions, and neutron mean-field potentials are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Although there is abundant and diverse observational evidence in support of white dwarf stars hosting planets or debris disks which form in the catastrophic destruction of various planetary bodies, the key processes that explain these observations are still being intensely investigated. The study of white dwarf planetary systems offers a unique perspective on exo-solar composition, that cannot be obtained by any other means. This chapter describes the various observational techniques that are used in order to find and characterize exo-planets and debris disks around white dwarfs. In turn, it discusses how to theoretically interpret these observations by surveying an array of various research tools and models currently employed in this field.</description>

Abstract: Observations of caustic-crossing galaxies at redshift $0.7&lt;z&lt;1$ show a wealth of transient events. Most of them are believed to be microlensing events of highly magnified stars. Earlier work predicted such events should be common near the critical curves (CCs) of galaxy clusters, but some are found relatively far away from these CCs. We consider the possibility that substructure on milliarcsecond scales (few parsecs in the lens plane) is boosting the microlensing signal. We study the combined magnification from the macrolens, millilenses, and microlenses (3M-lensing). After considering realistic populations of millilenses and microlenses, we conclude that the enhanced microlensing rate around millilenses is not sufficient to explain the high fraction of observed events in the far region. Instead we find a that the shape of the luminosity function (LF) of the lensed stars combined with the amount of substructure in the lens plane determines the number of mcirolensing events found near and far from the CC. By measuring $\beta$ (the exponent of the LF), and the number density of microlensing events at each location, one can create a pseudoimage of the underlying distribution of mass on small scales. We identify two regimes: (i) positive imaging regime where $\beta&gt;2$ and the number density of events is greater around substructureand the number density of events is greater around substructures, and (ii) negative imaging regime where $\beta&lt;2$. We study the particular case of seven microlensing events found by HST in the Dragon arc (at z=0.725). We find that a population of supergiant stars with a steep LF with $\beta=2.55$ fits the distribution of these events. We identify a small region of high density of microlensing events, and interpret it as evidence of a possible invisible substructure, for which we derive a mass of $\sim 1.3 \times 10^8\,\Msun$ (within its Einstein radius).</description>
