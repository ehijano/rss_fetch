      <title>SETI in 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this third installment of SETI in 20xx, we very briefly and subjectively review developments in SETI in 2022. Our primary focus is 80 papers and books published or made public in 2022, which we sort into six broad categories: results from actual searches, new search methods and instrumentation, target and frequency selection, the development of technosignatures, theory of ETIs, and social aspects of SETI.</description>

      <title>Efficient Systematic Reviews: Literature Filtering with Transformers &amp; Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying critical research within the growing body of academic work is an intrinsic aspect of conducting quality research. Systematic review processes used in evidence-based medicine formalise this as a procedure that must be followed in a research program. However, it comes with an increasing burden in terms of the time required to identify the important articles of research for a given topic. In this work, we develop a method for building a general-purpose filtering system that matches a research question, posed as a natural language description of the required content, against a candidate set of articles obtained via the application of broad search terms. Our results demonstrate that transformer models, pre-trained on biomedical literature, and then fine tuned for the specific task, offer a promising solution to this problem. The model can remove large volumes of irrelevant articles for most research questions. Furthermore, analysis of the specific research questions in our training data suggest natural avenues for further improvement.</description>

      <title>R-Index: A Metric for Assessing Researcher Contributions to Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose the R-Index, defined as the difference between the sum of review responsibilities for a researcher's publications and the number of reviews they have completed, as a novel metric to effectively characterize a researcher's contribution to the peer review process. This index aims to balance the demands placed on the peer review system by a researcher's publication output with their engagement in reviewing others' work, providing a measure of whether they are giving back to the academic community commensurately with their own publication demands. The R-Index offers a straightforward and fair approach to encourage equitable participation in peer review, thereby supporting the sustainability and efficiency of the scholarly publishing process.</description>
