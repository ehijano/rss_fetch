      <title>Semantic Information G Theory for Range Control with Tradeoff between Purposiveness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning suggest that we need to maximize and minimize two different kinds of information simultaneously. The Information Max-Min (IMM) method has been used in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and maximum entropy control. Shannon's information rate-distortion function is the theoretical basis of Minimizing Mutual Information (MMI) and data compression, but it is not enough to solve the IMM problem. The author has proposed the semantic information G theory (i.e., Shannon-Lu theory), including the semantic information G measure and the information rate fidelity function R(G) (R is the MMI for the given G of semantic mutual information). The parameter solution of the R(G) function provides a general method to improve the information efficiency, G/R. This paper briefly introduces the semantic information G measure and the parametric solution of the R(G) function. Two examples reveal that the parametric solution can help us optimize range control with the tradeoff between purposiveness (i.e., semantic mutual information) and information efficiency. It seems that the R(G) function can serve as the theoretical basis of IMM methods, but we still need further research in combination with deep learning, reinforcement learning, and constraint control.</description>

      <title>Multiuser Commitment over Noisy Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-user commitment models that capture the problem of enabling multiple bidders to simultaneously submit auctions to verifiers while ensuring that i) verifiers do not obtain information on the auctions until bidders reveal them at a later stage; and, ii) bidders cannot change their auction once committed. Specifically, we assume that bidders and verifiers have access to a noiseless channel as well as a noisy multiple-access channel or broadcast channel, where inputs are controlled by the bidders and outputs are observed by verifiers. In the case of multiple bidders and a single verifier connected by a non-redundant multiple-access channel, we characterize the commitment capacity region when bidders are not colluding. When the bidders are colluding, we derive an achievable region and a tight converse for the sum rate. In both cases our proposed achievable commitment schemes are constructive. In the case of a single bidder and multiple verifiers connected by a non-redundant broadcast channel, in which verifiers could drop out of the network after auctions are committed, we also characterize the commitment capacity. Our results demonstrate how commitment schemes can benefit from multi-user protocols, and develop resilience when some verifiers may become unavailable.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content Technologies Meet Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06193v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) technologies, with a predominance of large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements in various applications, which have attracted great interests from both academia and industry. Although some noteworthy advancements have been made in this area, a comprehensive exploration of the intricate relationship between AIGC and communication networks remains relatively limited. To address this issue, this paper conducts an exhaustive survey from dual standpoints: firstly, it scrutinizes the integration of LLMs and AIGC technologies within the domain of communication networks; secondly, it investigates how the communication networks can further bolster the capabilities of LLMs and AIGC. Additionally, this research explores the promising applications along with the challenges encountered during the incorporation of these AI technologies into communication networks. Through these detailed analyses, our work aims to deepen the understanding of how LLMs and AIGC can synergize with and enhance the development of advanced intelligent communication networks, contributing to a more profound comprehension of next-generation intelligent communication networks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Compliant Modeling and Scaling Laws of Multi-RIS Aided MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) enables the control of wireless channels to improve coverage. To further extend coverage, multi-RIS aided systems have been explored, where multiple RISs steer the signal via a multi-hop path. However, deriving a physics-compliant channel model for multi-RIS aided systems is still an open problem. In this study, we fill this gap by modeling multi-RIS aided systems through multiport network theory, and deriving a channel model accounting for impedance mismatch, mutual coupling, and structural scattering. The derived physics-compliant model differs from the model widely used in literature, which omits the RIS structural scattering. To quantify this difference, we derive the channel gain scaling laws of the two models under line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath channels. Theoretical insights, validated by numerical results, show an important discrepancy between the physics-compliant and the widely used models, increasing with the number of RISs and multipath richness. In a multi-hop system aided by four 128-element RISs with multipath channels, optimizing the RISs using the widely used model and applying their solutions to the physics-compliant model achieves only 7% of the maximum channel gain. This highlights how severely mismatched channel models can be, calling for more accurate models in communication theory.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Shaped Multilevel Polar Coding for Wiretap Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wiretap channel is served as the fundamental model of physical layer security techniques, where the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel is proven to be achieved by Gaussian input. However, there remains a gap between the Gaussian secrecy capacity and the secrecy rate with conventional uniformly distributed discrete constellation input, e.g. amplitude shift keying (ASK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In this paper, we propose a probabilistic shaped multilevel polar coding scheme to bridge the gap. Specifically, the input distribution optimization problem for maximizing the secrecy rate with ASK/QAM input is solved. Numerical results show that the resulting sub-optimal solution can still approach the Gaussian secrecy capacity. Then, we investigate the polarization of multilevel polar codes for the asymmetric discrete memoryless wiretap channel, and thus propose a multilevel polar coding scheme integration with probabilistic shaping. It is proved that the scheme can achieve the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel with discrete constellation input, and satisfies the reliability condition and weak security condition. A security-oriented polar code construction method to natively satisfies the leakage-based security condition is also investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves more efficient and secure transmission than the uniform constellation input case over both the Gaussian wiretap channel and the Rayleigh fading wiretap channel.</description>

      <title>Polarization Aware Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Joint Age-State Belief is All You Need: Minimizing AoII via Pull-Based Remote Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age of incorrect information (AoII) is a recently proposed freshness and mismatch metric that penalizes an incorrect estimation along with its duration. Therefore, keeping track of AoII requires the knowledge of both the source and estimation processes. In this paper, we consider a time-slotted pull-based remote estimation system under a sampling rate constraint where the information source is a general discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) process. Moreover, packet transmission times from the source to the monitor are non-zero which disallows the monitor to have perfect information on the actual AoII process at any time. Hence, for this pull-based system, we propose the monitor to maintain a sufficient statistic called {\em belief} which stands for the joint distribution of the age and source processes to be obtained from the history of all observations. Using belief, we first propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to be used at the monitor as opposed to existing martingale estimators in the literature. Second, we obtain the optimality equations from the belief-MDP (Markov decision process) formulation. Finally, we propose two belief-dependent policies one of which is based on deep reinforcement learning, and the other one is a threshold-based policy based on the instantaneous expected AoII.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Multiport Network Models and Performance Benefits in Full-Duplex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) is a new advance in RIS techniques that introduces reconfigurable inter-element connections to generate scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal. BD-RIS has been recently proposed and proven to have benefits in enhancing channel gain and enlarging coverage in wireless communications. Uniquely, BD-RIS enables reciprocal and non-reciprocal architectures characterized by symmetric and non-symmetric scattering matrices. However, the performance benefits and new use cases enabled by non-reciprocal BD-RIS for wireless systems remain unexplored. This work takes a first step toward closing this knowledge gap and studies the non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems and its performance benefits over reciprocal counterparts. We start by deriving a general RIS aided full-duplex system model using a multiport circuit theory, followed by a simplified channel model based on physically consistent assumptions. With the considered channel model, we investigate the effect of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and identify the theoretical conditions for reciprocal and non-reciprocal BD-RISs to simultaneously achieve the maximum received power of the signal of interest in the uplink and the downlink. Simulation results validate the theories and highlight the significant benefits offered by non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems. The significant gains are achieved because of the non-reciprocity principle which implies that if a wave hits the non-reciprocal BD-RIS from one direction, the surface behaves differently than if it hits from the opposite direction. This enables an uplink user and a downlink user at different locations to optimally communicate with the same full-duplex base station via a non-reciprocal BD-RIS, which would not be possible with reciprocal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucination with ZeroG: An Advanced Knowledge Management Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of digital documents presents significant challenges in efficient management and knowledge extraction. Traditional methods often struggle with complex documents, leading to issues such as hallucinations and high latency in responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). ZeroG, an innovative approach, significantly mitigates these challenges by leveraging knowledge distillation and prompt tuning to enhance model performance.
  ZeroG utilizes a smaller model that replicates the behavior of a larger teacher model, ensuring contextually relevant and grounded responses, by employing a black-box distillation approach, it creates a distilled dataset without relying on intermediate features, optimizing computational efficiency. This method significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times, providing a balanced solution for modern document management.
  Incorporating advanced techniques for document ingestion and metadata utilization, ZeroG improves the accuracy of question-and-answer systems. The integration of graph databases and robust metadata management further streamlines information retrieval, allowing for precise and context-aware responses. By transforming how organizations interact with complex data, ZeroG enhances productivity and user experience, offering a scalable solution for the growing demands of digital document management.</description>

      <title>HiHa: Introducing Hierarchical Harmonic Decomposition to Implicit Neural Compression for Atmospheric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large climate models has created the requirement of storing and transferring massive atmospheric data worldwide. Therefore, data compression is essential for meteorological research, but an efficient compression scheme capable of keeping high accuracy with high compressibility is still lacking. As an emerging technique, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has recently acquired impressive momentum and demonstrates high promise for compressing diverse natural data. However, the INR-based compression encounters a bottleneck due to the sophisticated spatio-temporal properties and variability. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Harmonic decomposition implicit neural compression (HiHa) for atmospheric data. HiHa firstly segments the data into multi-frequency signals through decomposition of multiple complex harmonic, and then tackles each harmonic respectively with a frequency-based hierarchical compression module consisting of sparse storage, multi-scale INR and iterative decomposition sub-modules. We additionally design a temporal residual compression module to accelerate compression by utilizing temporal continuity. Experiments depict that HiHa outperforms both mainstream compressors and other INR-based methods in both compression fidelity and capabilities, and also demonstrate that using compressed data in existing data-driven models can achieve the same accuracy as raw data.</description>

      <title>TinyML NLP Approach for Semantic Wireless Sentiment Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations, such as semantic sentiment analysis and text synthesis, may often impair users' privacy and demand significant on device computational resources. Centralized learning (CL) on the edge offers an alternative energy-efficient approach, yet requires the collection of raw information, which affects the user's privacy. While Federated learning (FL) preserves privacy, it requires high computational energy on board tiny user devices. We introduce split learning (SL) as an energy-efficient alternative, privacy-preserving tiny machine learning (TinyML) scheme and compare it to FL and CL in the presence of Rayleigh fading and additive noise. Our results show that SL reduces processing power and CO2 emissions while maintaining high accuracy, whereas FL offers a balanced compromise between efficiency and privacy. Hence, this study provides insights into deploying energy-efficient, privacy-preserving NLP models on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Equivariance in Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (\eg colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

      <title>A Practical Validation of RIS Detection and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging perception from radar data can assist multiple communication tasks, especially in highly-mobile and large-scale MIMO systems. One particular challenge, however, is how to distinguish the communication user (object) from the other mobile objects in the sensing scene. This paper formulates this \textit{user identification} problem and develops two solutions, a baseline model-based solution that maps the objects angles from the radar scene to communication beams and a scalable deep learning solution that is agnostic to the number of candidate objects. Using the DeepSense 6G dataset, which have real-world measurements, the developed deep learning approach achieves more than $93.4\%$ communication user identification accuracy, highlighting a promising path for enabling integrated radar-communication applications in the real world.</description>

      <title>Antenna Coding Empowered by Pixel Antennas</title>

Abstract: Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Mixture of Experts for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but the role of wireless networks in supporting LLMs has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed Mixture of Experts (WDMoE) architecture to enable collaborative deployment of LLMs across edge servers at the base station (BS) and mobile devices in wireless networks. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by placing the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks among the devices. This deployment leverages the parallel inference capabilities of expert networks on mobile devices, effectively utilizing the limited computing and caching resources of these devices. Accordingly, we develop a performance metric for WDMoE-based LLMs, which accounts for both model capability and latency. To minimize the latency while maintaining accuracy, we jointly optimize expert selection and bandwidth allocation based on the performance metric. Moreover, we build a hardware testbed using NVIDIA Jetson kits to validate the effectiveness of WDMoE. Both theoretical simulations and practical hardware experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the latency without compromising LLM performance.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Polynomial Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An estimation method is presented for polynomial phase signals, i.e., those adopting the form of a complex exponential whose phase is polynomial in its indices. Transcending the scope of existing techniques, the proposed estimator can handle an arbitrary number of dimensions and an arbitrary set of polynomial degrees along each dimension; the only requirement is that the number of observations per dimension exceeds the highest degree thereon. Embodied by a highly compact sequential algorithm, this estimator exhibits a strictly linear computational complexity in the number of observations, and is efficient at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To reinforce the performance at low and medium SNRs, where any phase estimator is bound to be hampered by the inherent ambiguity caused by phase wrappings, suitable functionalities are incorporated and shown to be highly effective.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Semantic Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on semantic considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, semantic scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based semantic scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by semantic communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Collaborative Online Personalized Mean Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. In particular, we provide a method based on hypothesis testing coupled with differential privacy and data variance estimation. Two privacy mechanisms and two data variance estimation schemes are proposed, and we provide a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data. Moreover, we provide analytical performance curves for the case with an oracle class estimator, i.e., the class structure of the agents, where agents receiving data from distributions with the same mean are considered to be in the same class, is known. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by extensive numerical results showing that for a considered scenario the proposed approach indeed converges much faster than a fully local approach, and performs comparably to ideal performance where all data is public. This illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Error Estimation Method in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Error estimation is an important step for error correction in quantum key distribution. Traditional error estimation methods require sacrificing a part of the sifted key, forcing a trade-off between the accuracy of error estimation and the size of the partial sifted key to be used and discarded. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that aims to preserve the entire sifted key after error estimation while preventing Eve from gaining any advantage. The entire sifted key, modified and extended by our proposed method, is sent for error estimation in a public channel. Although accessible to an eavesdropper, the modified and extended sifted key ensures that the number of attempts to crack it remains the same as when no information is leaked. The entire sifted key is preserved for subsequent procedures, indicating the efficient utilization of quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm to search a family of multiple sets of minimum correlated one dimensional uni-polar (optical) orthogonal codes (1-DUOC) or optical orthogonal codes (OOC) with fixed as well as variable code parameters. The cardinality of each set is equal to upper bound. The codes within a set can be searched for general values of code length, code weight, auto-correlation constraint and cross-correlation constraint. Each set forms a maximal clique of the codes within given range of correlation properties . These one-dimensional uni-polar orthogonal codes can find their application as signature sequences for spectral spreading purpose in incoherent optical code division multiple access (CDMA) systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.03949v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rate and energy efficiency of wireless channels can be improved by deploying software-controlled metasurfaces to reflect signals from the source to the destination, especially when the direct path is weak. While previous works mainly optimized the reflections, this letter compares the new technology with classic decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. The main observation is that very high rates and/or large metasurfaces are needed to outperform DF relaying, both in terms of minimizing the total transmit power and maximizing the energy efficiency, which also includes the dissipation in the transceiver hardware.</description>

      <title>Bisparse Blind Deconvolution through Hierarchical Sparse Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchical sparsity framework, and in particular the HiHTP algorithm, has been successfully applied to many relevant communication engineering problems recently, particularly when the signal space is hierarchically structured. In this paper, the applicability of the HiHTP algorithm for solving the bi-sparse blind deconvolution problem is studied. The bi-sparse blind deconvolution setting here consists of recovering $h$ and $b$ from the knowledge of $h*(Qb)$, where $Q$ is some linear operator, and both $b$ and $h$ are both assumed to be sparse. The approach rests upon lifting the problem to a linear one, and then applying HiHTP, through the \emph{hierarchical sparsity framework}. %In particular, the efficient HiHTP algorithm is proposed for performing the recovery.
  Then, for a Gaussian draw of the random matrix $Q$, it is theoretically shown that an $s$-sparse $h \in \mathbb{K}^\mu$ and $\sigma$-sparse $b \in \mathbb{K}^n$ with high probability can be recovered when $\mu \succcurlyeq s\log(s)^2\log(\mu)\log(\mu n) + s\sigma \log(n)$.</description>

Subsequently, we present the lower and upper bounds on the minimum symplectic distances of a class of $1$-generator QC codes and their symplectic dual codes by decomposing code spaces. As an application, we construct numerous new binary symplectic self-orthogonal QC codes with excellent parameters, leading to $117$ record-breaking quantum error-correction codes.</description>

      <title>A Superdirective Beamforming Approach with Impedance Coupling and Field Coupling for Compact Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In most multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, antennas are spaced at least half a wavelength apart to reduce mutual coupling. In this configuration, the maximum array gain is equal to the number of antennas. However, when the antenna spacing is significantly reduced, the array gain of a compact array can become proportional to the square of the number of antennas, greatly exceeding that of traditional MIMO systems. Achieving this "superdirectivity" requires complex calculations of the excitation coefficients (beamforming vector), which is a challenging task. In this paper, we address this problem with a novel double coupling-based superdirective beamforming method. In particular, we categorize the antenna coupling effects to impedance coupling and field coupling. By characterizing these two coupling in model, we derive the beamforming vector for superdirective arrays. We prove that the field coupling matrix has the unique solution for an antenna array, and itself has the ability to fully characterize the distorted coupling field. Based on this proven theorem, we propose a method that accurately calculates the coupling matrix using only a number of angle sampling points on the order of the number of antennas. Moreover, a prototype of an independently-controlled superdirective antenna array is developed. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches, and superdirectivity is achieved in reality by a compact array with 4 and 8 dipole antennas.</description>

      <title>Orchestration Framework for Open System Models with Autonomous RISs and Oblivious Base Stations</title>

Abstract: Autonomous reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers the potential to simplify deployment by reducing the need for real-time remote control between a base station (BS) and an RIS. However, we highlight two major challenges posed by autonomy. The first is implementation complexity, as autonomy requires hybrid RISs (HRISs) equipped with additional on-board hardware to monitor the propagation environment and conduct local channel estimation (CHEST), a process known as probing. The second challenge, termed probe distortion, reflects a form of the observer effect: during probing, an HRIS can inadvertently alter the propagation environment, potentially disrupting the operations of other communicating devices. While implementation complexity has been extensively studied, probe distortion remains largely unexplored. To further assess the potential of autonomous RISs, this paper comprehensively and pragmatically studies fundamental trade-offs posed by these challenges. We examine the robustness of an HRIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system under minimal design choices that reflect the essential elements and stringent conditions, including (a) two extremes of implementation complexity realized through minimalist operational designs of two HRIS hardware architectures, and (b) an oblivious BS that fully embraces probe distortion. To make our analysis possible, we propose a physical-layer orchestration framework that aligns HRIS and mMIMO operations. We provide empirical evidence showing that autonomous RIS holds promise even under these strict conditions and propose new research directions, particularly for advancing the understanding of probe distortion.</description>

Abstract: To characterize the complex higher-order interactions among variables within a system, this study introduces a novel framework, termed System Information Decomposition (SID), aimed at decomposing the information entropy of variables into information atoms based on their interrelations. Diverging from the established Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework, which predominantly concentrates on the directional interactions stemming from an array of source variables to a single target variable, SID adopts a holistic approach, scrutinizing the interactions across all variables within the system. Specifically, we proved all the information atoms are symmetric, which means the disentanglement of unique, redundant, and synergistic information from any specific target variable. Hence, our proposed SID framework can capture the symmetric pairwise and higher-order relationships among variables. This advance positions SID as a promising framework with the potential to foster a deeper understanding of higher-order relationships within complex systems across disciplines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology allows one to engineer spatial diversity in complex cellular networks. This paper provides a framework for the system-level performance assessment of RIS-assisted networks and in particular downlink coverage probability and ergodic rate. To account for the inherent randomness in the spatial deployments of base stations (BSs) and RISs, we model the placements of the RISs as point processes (PPs) conditioned on the associated BSs, which are modeled by a Poisson point process (PPP). These RIS PPs can be adapted based on the deployment strategy. We focus on modeling the RISs as a Mat\'ern cluster process (MCP), where each RIS cluster is a finite PPP with support a disc centered on the association BS. We assume that the system uses the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to exploit the multipath diversity provided by RISs. The coverage probability and the ergodic rate can be evaluated when RISs operate as batched powerless beamformers. The resulting analytical expressions provide a general methodology to evaluate the impact of key RIS-related parameters, such as the batch size and the density of RISs, on system-level performance. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we also analyze a RIS placement variant where RISs are deployed around coverage holes. Numerical evaluations of the analytical expressions and Monte-Carlo simulations jointly validate the proposed analytical approach and provide valuable insights into the design of future RIS-assisted cellular networks.</description>

Abstract: Self-orthogonal codes are a subclass of linear codes that are contained within their dual codes. Since self-orthogonal codes are widely used in quantum codes, lattice theory and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes, they have received continuous attention and research. In this paper, we construct a class of self-orthogonal codes by using the defining-set approach, and determine their explicit weight distributions and the parameters of their duals. Some considered codes are optimal according to the tables of best codes known maintained at \cite{Grassl} and a class of almost maximum distance separable (AMDS) codes from their duals are obtained. As applications, we obtain a class of new quantum codes, which are MDS or AMDS according to the quantum Singleton bound under certain conditions. Some examples show that the constructed quantum codes have the better parameters than known ones maintained at \cite{Bierbrauer}. Furthermore, a new class of LCD codes are given, which are almost optimal according to the sphere packing bound.</description>

      <title>On Function-Correcting Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15135v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes were introduced in the work "Function-Correcting Codes" (FCC) by Lenz et al. 2023, which provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this function dependent graph to get a lower bound on the redundancy required for function correction. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach leads to a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes (ECCs) of small distances. We propose a range of parameters for which the bound is tight. For single error correcting codes, we show that this bound is at least as good as a bound proposed by Zinoviev,
  Litsyn, and Laihonen in 1998. Thus, this framework helps to study systematic classical error correcting codes. Further, we study the structure of this function dependent graph for linear functions, which leads to bounds on the redundancy of linear-function correcting codes. We show that the Plotkin-like bound for Function-Correcting Codes that was proposed by Lenz et.al 2023 is simplified for linear functions. Also, we propose a version of the sphere packing bound for linear-function correcting codes. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight and also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Quantization Noise Suppression Gains in Digital Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital phased arrays have often been disregarded for millimeter-wave communications since the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are power-hungry. In this paper, we provide a different perspective on this matter by demonstrating analytically and numerically how the ADC resolution can be reduced when using digital phased arrays. We perform a theoretical analysis of the quantization noise characteristics for an OFDM signal received and processed by a digital phased array, using Gaussian approximation of the OFDM signal. In particular, we quantify the quantization noise suppression factor analytically and numerically. This factor describes how much the coherent combining reduces the quantization noise as a function of the number of antennas, which allows for reducing the ADC bit resolution. For instance in a 8-16 antenna digital phased array the ADC resolution can be reduced with 1-2 bits compared to the ADC required for an analog phased array.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to construct optimal quaternary additive codes with non-integer dimensions. Firstly, we propose combinatorial constructions of quaternary additive constant-weight codes, alongside additive generalized anticode construction. Subsequently, we propose generalized Construction X, which facilitates the construction of non-integer dimensional optimal additive codes from linear codes. Then, we construct ten classes of optimal quaternary non-integer dimensional additive codes through these two methods. As an application, we also determine the optimal additive $[n,3.5,n-t]_4$ codes for all $t$ with variable $n$, except for $t=6,7,12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we analyze the performance of mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions approach, which can improve the performance of cell-free multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CF mMIMO-OFDM) systems under asynchronous reception. To this end, we first obtain the achievable downlink sum-rate for the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions, and then provide a closed-form expression for the case with the maximum ratio precoding. Subsequently, an efficient clustering algorithm is proposed to group access points into different clusters with the same quantized phase shift in each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the mixed coherent and non-coherent transmissions can effectively improve the sum-rate of CF mMIMO-OFDM systems under asynchronous reception.</description>

      <title>High Information Density and Low Coverage Data Storage in DNA with Efficient Channel Coding Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA-based data storage has been attracting significant attention due to its extremely high data storage density, low power consumption, and long duration compared to conventional data storage media. Despite the recent advancements in DNA data storage technology, significant challenges remain. In particular, various types of errors can occur during the processes of DNA synthesis, storage, and sequencing, including substitution errors, insertion errors, and deletion errors. Furthermore, the entire oligo may be lost. In this work, we report a DNA-based data storage architecture that incorporates efficient channel coding schemes, including different types of error-correcting codes (ECCs) and constrained codes, for both the inner coding and outer coding for the DNA data storage channel. We also carried out large scale experiments to validate our proposed DNA-based data storage architecture. Specifically, 1.61 and 1.69 MB data were encoded into 30,000 oligos each, with information densities of 1.731 and 1.815, respectively. It has been found that the stored information can be fully recovered without any error at average coverages of 4.5 and 6.0, respectively. This experiment achieved the highest net information density and lowest coverage among existing DNA-based data storage experiments (with standard DNA), with data recovery rates and coverage approaching theoretical optima.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an infinite family of MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^s}$ and two infinite families of almost MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^s}$ for any prime $p$, by investigating the parameters of the dual codes of two families of BCH codes. Notably, these almost MDS codes include two infinite families of near MDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_{3^s}$, resolving a conjecture posed by Geng et al. in 2022. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both of these almost AMDS codes and their dual codes hold infinite families of $3$-designs over \(\mathbb{F}_{p^s}\) for any prime $p$. Additionally, we study the subfield subcodes of these families of MDS and near MDS codes, and provide several binary, ternary, and quaternary codes with best known parameters.</description>

      <title>Ultra-marginal Feature Importance: Learning from Data with Causal Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09938v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists frequently prioritize learning from data rather than training the best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes the latter. Marginal contribution feature importance (MCI) was developed to break this trend by providing a useful framework for quantifying the relationships in data. In this work, we aim to improve upon the theoretical properties, performance, and runtime of MCI by introducing ultra-marginal feature importance (UMFI), which uses dependence removal techniques from the AI fairness literature as its foundation. We first propose axioms for feature importance methods that seek to explain the causal and associative relationships in data, and we prove that UMFI satisfies these axioms under basic assumptions. We then show on real and simulated data that UMFI performs better than MCI, especially in the presence of correlated interactions and unrelated features, while partially learning the structure of the causal graph and reducing the exponential runtime of MCI to super-linear.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Estimation via $f$-Divergence and Data Derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating mutual information accurately is pivotal across diverse applications, from machine learning to communications and biology, enabling us to gain insights into the inner mechanisms of complex systems. Yet, dealing with high-dimensional data presents a formidable challenge, due to its size and the presence of intricate relationships. Recently proposed neural methods employing variational lower bounds on the mutual information have gained prominence. However, these approaches suffer from either high bias or high variance, as the sample size and the structure of the loss function directly influence the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel class of discriminative mutual information estimators based on the variational representation of the $f$-divergence. We investigate the impact of the permutation function used to obtain the marginal training samples and present a novel architectural solution based on derangements. The proposed estimator is flexible since it exhibits an excellent bias/variance trade-off. The comparison with state-of-the-art neural estimators, through extensive experimentation within established reference scenarios, shows that our approach offers higher accuracy and lower complexity.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Free Two-Bit Covariance Estimator with Improved Operator Norm Error Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A covariance matrix estimator using two bits per entry was recently developed by Dirksen, Maly and Rauhut [Annals of Statistics, 50(6), pp. 3538-3562]. The estimator achieves near minimax rate for general sub-Gaussian distributions, but also suffers from two downsides: theoretically, there is an essential gap on operator norm error between their estimator and sample covariance when the diagonal of the covariance matrix is dominated by only a few entries; practically, its performance heavily relies on the dithering scale, which needs to be tuned according to some unknown parameters. In this work, we propose a new 2-bit covariance matrix estimator that simultaneously addresses both issues. Unlike the sign quantizer associated with uniform dither in Dirksen et al., we adopt a triangular dither prior to a 2-bit quantizer inspired by the multi-bit uniform quantizer. By employing dithering scales varying across entries, our estimator enjoys an improved operator norm error rate that depends on the effective rank of the underlying covariance matrix rather than the ambient dimension, thus closing the theoretical gap. Moreover, our proposed method eliminates the need of any tuning parameter, as the dithering scales are entirely determined by the data. Experimental results under Gaussian samples are provided to showcase the impressive numerical performance of our estimator. Remarkably, by halving the dithering scales, our estimator oftentimes achieves operator norm errors less than twice of the errors of sample covariance.</description>

      <title>On the Counting of Involutory MDS Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00090v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal branch number of MDS matrices has established their importance in designing diffusion layers for various block ciphers and hash functions. As a result, numerous matrix structures, including Hadamard and circulant matrices, have been proposed for constructing MDS matrices. Also, in the literature, significant attention is typically given to identifying MDS candidates with optimal implementations or proposing new constructions across different orders. However, this paper takes a different approach by not emphasizing efficiency issues or introducing new constructions. Instead, its primary objective is to enumerate Hadamard MDS and involutory Hadamard MDS matrices of order $4$ within the field $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Specifically, it provides an explicit formula for the count of both Hadamard MDS and involutory Hadamard MDS matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Additionally, it derives the count of Hadamard Near-MDS (NMDS) and involutory Hadamard NMDS matrices, each with exactly one zero in each row, of order $4$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$. Furthermore, the paper discusses some circulant-like matrices for constructing NMDS matrices and proves that when $n$ is even, any $2n \times 2n$ Type-II circulant-like matrix can never be an NMDS matrix. While it is known that NMDS matrices may be singular, this paper establishes that singular Hadamard matrices can never be NMDS matrices. Moreover, it proves that there exist exactly two orthogonal Type-I circulant-like matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{F}_{2^r}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of statistical inference in its various forms has been the subject of decades-long extensive research. Most of the effort has been focused on characterizing the behavior as a function of the number of available samples, with far less attention given to the effect of memory limitations on performance. Recently, this latter topic has drawn much interest in the engineering and computer science literature. In this survey paper, we attempt to review the state-of-the-art of statistical inference under memory constraints in several canonical problems, including hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and distribution property testing/estimation. We discuss the main results in this developing field, and by identifying recurrent themes, we extract some fundamental building blocks for algorithmic construction, as well as useful techniques for lower bound derivations.</description>

      <title>Universal Exact Compression of Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Coded Computing for Resilient Distributed Computing: A Learning-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coded computing has emerged as a promising framework for tackling significant challenges in large-scale distributed computing, including the presence of slow, faulty, or compromised servers. In this approach, each worker node processes a combination of the data, rather than the raw data itself. The final result then is decoded from the collective outputs of the worker nodes. However, there is a significant gap between current coded computing approaches and the broader landscape of general distributed computing, particularly when it comes to machine learning workloads. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel foundation for coded computing, integrating the principles of learning theory, and developing a framework that seamlessly adapts with machine learning applications. In this framework, the objective is to find the encoder and decoder functions that minimize the loss function, defined as the mean squared error between the estimated and true values. Facilitating the search for the optimum decoding and functions, we show that the loss function can be upper-bounded by the summation of two terms: the generalization error of the decoding function and the training error of the encoding function. Focusing on the second-order Sobolev space, we then derive the optimal encoder and decoder. We show that in the proposed solution, the mean squared error of the estimation decays with the rate of $\mathcal{O}(S^3 N^{-3})$ and $\mathcal{O}(S^{\frac{8}{5}}N^{\frac{-3}{5}})$ in noiseless and noisy computation settings, respectively, where $N$ is the number of worker nodes with at most $S$ slow servers (stragglers). Finally, we evaluate the proposed scheme on inference tasks for various machine learning models and demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and rate of convergence.</description>

Abstract: Civilian communication during disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and military conflicts is crucial for saving lives. Nevertheless, several challenges exist during these circumstances such as the destruction of cellular communication and electricity infrastructure, lack of line of sight (LoS), and difficulty of localization under the rubble. In this article, we discuss key enablers that can boost communication during disasters, namely, satellite and aerial platforms, redundancy, silencing, and sustainable networks aided with wireless energy transfer (WET). The article also highlights how these solutions can be implemented in order to solve the failure of communication during disasters. Finally, it sheds light on unresolved challenges, as well as future research directions.</description>
