      <title>Forecasting NYC Yellow Taxi Ridership Decline: A Time Series Analysis of Daily Passenger Counts (2017-2019)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes and forecasts daily passenger counts for New York City's iconic yellow taxis during 2017-2019, a period of significant decline in ridership. Using a comprehensive dataset from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, we employ various time series modeling approaches, including ARIMA models, to predict daily passenger volumes. Our analysis reveals strong seasonal patterns, with a consistent linear decline of approximately 200 passengers per day throughout the study period. After comparing multiple modeling approaches, we find that a first-order autoregressive model, combined with careful detrending and cycle removal, provides the most accurate predictions, achieving a test RMSE of 34,880 passengers on a mean ridership of 438,000 daily passengers. The research provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in understanding and potentially addressing the declining trajectory of NYC's yellow taxi service.</description>

      <title>Artificial Finance: How AI Thinks About Money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) approach financial decision-making by systematically comparing their responses to those of human participants across the globe. We posed a set of commonly used financial decision-making questions to seven leading LLMs, including five models from the GPT series(GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3-mini), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and DeepSeek R1. We then compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53 nations. Our analysis reveals three main results. First, LLMs generally exhibit a risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected value calculations when faced with lottery-type questions. Second, when evaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce responses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning. Third, when we examine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses most closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania. These findings contribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision behaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded within their outputs.</description>

      <title>Propagation of carbon price shocks through the value chain: the mean-field game of defaults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field game framework to analyze the impact of carbon pricing in a multi-sector economy with defaultable firms. Each sector produces a homogeneous good, with its price endogenously determined through market clearing. Firms act as price takers and maximize profits by choosing an optimal allocation of inputs-including labor, emissions, and intermediate goods from other sectors-while interacting through the endogenous sectoral price. Firms also choose their default timing to maximize shareholder value.
  Formally, we model the economy as an optimal stopping mean-field game within each sector. The resulting system of coupled mean-field games admits a linear programming formulation that characterizes Nash equilibria in terms of population measure flows. We prove the existence of a linear programming Nash equilibrium and establish uniqueness of the associated price system.
  Numerical illustrations are presented for firms with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production functions. In a stylized single-sector economy, carbon price shocks induce substitution between emissions and labor. In a three-sector economy, the manufacturing sector faces consumer demand and requires inputs from a brown sector, which can be increasingly replaced by green-sector goods as carbon prices rise. These experiments reveal that carbon price shocks can generate substantial spillover effects along the value chain, underscoring the importance of sectoral interdependencies in shaping effective decarbonization pathways.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Optimization for European Electricity System Planning Considering Regional Dunkelflaute Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a capacity expansion model for a fully decarbonized European electricity system using an Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) framework. The model endogenously identifies the worst regional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar availability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a single optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with the geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption increases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to much sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across most of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of 71%. The optimal technology mix evolves with the severity of weather stress: while renewables, batteries, and interregional transmission are sufficient to manage localized events, large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen storage and load shedding to maintain system resilience. Central European regions, especially Germany and France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while peripheral regions bear the cost of compensatory overbuilding. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond national planning to support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up flexible technologies such as long-duration storage, and promote a geographically balanced deployment of renewables to mitigate systemic risks associated with Dunkelflaute events.</description>

      <title>Measuring artificial intelligence: a systematic assessment and implications for governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Governing artificial intelligence (AI) inventions is a major policy concern, yet definitions and measurement remain contested. We compare four patent-based approaches reflecting distinct understandings of AI. Using US patents (1990-2019), we assess the degree to which each approach classifies AI as a general-purpose technology (GPT) and examine patent concentration--two central policy-relevant dimensions. The approaches overlap in just 1.37% of patents, defining between 3-17% of all US patents in 2019 as AI. All approaches confirm AI's GPT characteristics, with the smallest keyword-based set exhibiting the highest growth and generality. High GPTness indicates public good characteristics, justifying public support. Across methods, AI patents concentrate among a few firms, highlighting market power and regulatory challenges. Policy implementation, thus, requires careful consideration of multiple classification methods to ensure robust, inclusive, and effective AI governance.</description>

      <title>Spending Behavior and Economic Impacts of Urban Digital Consumption Vouchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the Taipei Bear Vouchers 2.0 program using verified user-level survey data and a regional input-output model to assess the effectiveness of consumption vouchers as a fiscal stimulus tool. We focus on three key behavioral mechanisms: expenditure substitution, induced consumption, and the intensity of treatment through varying voucher face values. Our findings show that voucher effectiveness differs by type. Accommodation vouchers stimulate the most additional spending due to low expenditure substitution and high induced consumption effects, while sports vouchers often replace existing consumption. Increases in voucher value further enhance marginal consumption, especially when this change is a part of unexpected policy. Taking these behavioral responses into account, we find that the output multiplier of the program rises significantly, and indirect benefits extend to untargeted sectors through inter-industry linkages. These results highlight the critical role of consumer behavior in shaping policy outcomes and offer practical guidance for designing more effective and targeted consumption voucher programs.</description>

      <title>Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.</description>
