      <title>SEAL: Speech Embedding Alignment Learning for Speech Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding-based retrieval models have made significant strides in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques for text and multimodal large language models (LLMs) applications. However, when it comes to speech larage language models (SLLMs), these methods are limited to a two-stage process, where automatic speech recognition (ASR) is combined with text-based retrieval. This sequential architecture suffers from high latency and error propagation. To address these limitations, we propose a unified embedding framework that eliminates the need for intermediate text representations. Specifically, the framework includes separate speech and text encoders, followed by a shared scaling layer that maps both modalities into a common embedding space. Our model reduces pipeline latency by 50\% while achieving higher retrieval accuracy compared to traditional two-stage methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the challenges inherent in end-to-end speech retrieval and introduce architectural principles for effective speech-to-document matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our approach across diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations, paving the way for a new paradigm in multimodal SLLMs retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>GenSE: Generative Speech Enhancement via Language Models using Hierarchical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic information refers to the meaning conveyed through words, phrases, and contextual relationships within a given linguistic structure. Humans can leverage semantic information, such as familiar linguistic patterns and contextual cues, to reconstruct incomplete or masked speech signals in noisy environments. However, existing speech enhancement (SE) approaches often overlook the rich semantic information embedded in speech, which is crucial for improving intelligibility, speaker consistency, and overall quality of enhanced speech signals. To enrich the SE model with semantic information, we employ language models as an efficient semantic learner and propose a comprehensive framework tailored for language model-based speech enhancement, called \textit{GenSE}. Specifically, we approach SE as a conditional language modeling task rather than a continuous signal regression problem defined in existing works. This is achieved by tokenizing speech signals into semantic tokens using a pre-trained self-supervised model and into acoustic tokens using a custom-designed single-quantizer neural codec model. To improve the stability of language model predictions, we propose a hierarchical modeling method that decouples the generation of clean semantic tokens and clean acoustic tokens into two distinct stages. Moreover, we introduce a token chain prompting mechanism during the acoustic token generation stage to ensure timbre consistency throughout the speech enhancement process. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art SE systems in terms of speech quality and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Preference Optimization Improves Zero-shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating human feedback to align text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human preferences has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the robustness of language model-based TTS systems. Current approaches primarily focus on using preference data annotated at the utterance level. However, frequent issues that affect the listening experience often only arise in specific segments of audio samples, while other segments are well-generated. In this study, we propose a fine-grained preference optimization approach (FPO) to enhance the robustness of TTS systems. FPO focuses on addressing localized issues in generated samples rather than uniformly optimizing the entire utterance. Specifically, we first analyze the types of issues in generated samples, categorize them into two groups, and propose a selective training loss strategy to optimize preferences based on fine-grained labels for each issue type. Experimental results show that FPO enhances the robustness of zero-shot TTS systems by effectively addressing local issues, significantly reducing the bad case ratio, and improving intelligibility. Furthermore, FPO exhibits superior data efficiency compared with baseline systems, achieving similar performance with fewer training samples.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Broadcast Media Subtitle Transcripts for Automatic Speech Recognition and Subtitling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancement of speech recognition technology has been driven by large-scale datasets and attention-based architectures, but many challenges still remain, especially for low-resource languages and dialects. This paper explores the integration of weakly supervised transcripts from TV subtitles into automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, aiming to improve both verbatim transcriptions and automatically generated subtitles. To this end, verbatim data and subtitles are regarded as different domains or languages, due to their distinct characteristics. We propose and compare several end-to-end architectures that are designed to jointly model both modalities with separate or shared encoders and decoders. The proposed methods are able to jointly generate a verbatim transcription and a subtitle. Evaluation on Flemish (Belgian Dutch) demonstrates that a model with cascaded encoders and separate decoders allows to represent the differences between the two data types most efficiently while improving on both domains. Despite differences in domain and linguistic variations, combining verbatim transcripts with subtitle data leads to notable ASR improvements without the need for extensive preprocessing. Additionally, experiments with a large-scale subtitle dataset show the scalability of the proposed approach. The methods not only improve ASR accuracy but also generate subtitles that closely match standard written text, offering several potential applications.</description>

      <title>Should Audio Front-ends be Adaptive? Comparing Learnable and Adaptive Front-ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-crafted features, such as Mel-filterbanks, have traditionally been the choice for many audio processing applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in learnable front-ends that extract representations directly from the raw audio waveform. \textcolor{black}{However, both hand-crafted filterbanks and current learnable front-ends lead to fixed computation graphs at inference time, failing to dynamically adapt to varying acoustic environments, a key feature of human auditory systems.} To this end, we explore the question of whether audio front-ends should be adaptive by comparing the Ada-FE front-end (a recently developed adaptive front-end that employs a neural adaptive feedback controller to dynamically adjust the Q-factors of its spectral decomposition filters) to established learnable front-ends. Specifically, we systematically investigate learnable front-ends and Ada-FE across two commonly used back-end backbones and a wide range of audio benchmarks including speech, sound event, and music. The comprehensive results show that our Ada-FE outperforms advanced learnable front-ends, and more importantly, it exhibits impressive stability or robustness on test samples over various training epochs.</description>

      <title>Streaming Speaker Change Detection and Gender Classification for Transducer-Based Multi-Talker Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming multi-talker speech translation is a task that involves not only generating accurate and fluent translations with low latency but also recognizing when a speaker change occurs and what the speaker's gender is. Speaker change information can be used to create audio prompts for a zero-shot text-to-speech system, and gender can help to select speaker profiles in a conventional text-to-speech model. We propose to tackle streaming speaker change detection and gender classification by incorporating speaker embeddings into a transducer-based streaming end-to-end speech translation model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve high accuracy for both speaker change detection and gender classification.</description>

      <title>Developing multilingual speech synthesis system for Ojibwe, Mi'kmaq, and Maliseet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present lightweight flow matching multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) systems for Ojibwe, Mi'kmaq, and Maliseet, three Indigenous languages in North America. Our results show that training a multilingual TTS model on three typologically similar languages can improve the performance over monolingual models, especially when data are scarce. Attention-free architectures are highly competitive with self-attention architecture with higher memory efficiency. Our research not only advances technical development for the revitalization of low-resource languages but also highlights the cultural gap in human evaluation protocols, calling for a more community-centered approach to human evaluation.</description>

      <title>AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</description>

      <title>Metis: A Foundation Speech Generation Model with Masked Generative Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Metis, a foundation model for unified speech generation. Unlike previous task-specific or multi-task models, Metis follows a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. It is pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled speech data using masked generative modeling and then fine-tuned to adapt to diverse speech generation tasks. Specifically, 1) Metis utilizes two discrete speech representations: SSL tokens derived from speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and acoustic tokens directly quantized from waveforms. 2) Metis performs masked generative pre-training on SSL tokens, utilizing 300K hours of diverse speech data, without any additional condition. 3) Through fine-tuning with task-specific conditions, Metis achieves efficient adaptation to various speech generation tasks while supporting multimodal input, even when using limited data and trainable parameters. Experiments demonstrate that Metis can serve as a foundation model for unified speech generation: Metis outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five speech generation tasks, including zero-shot text-to-speech, voice conversion, target speaker extraction, speech enhancement, and lip-to-speech, even with fewer than 20M trainable parameters or 300 times less training data. Audio samples are are available at https://metis-demo.github.io/.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simultaneous Speech-To-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hibiki, a decoder-only model for simultaneous speech translation. Hibiki leverages a multistream language model to synchronously process source and target speech, and jointly produces text and audio tokens to perform speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. We furthermore address the fundamental challenge of simultaneous interpretation, which unlike its consecutive counterpart, where one waits for the end of the source utterance to start translating, adapts its flow to accumulate just enough context to produce a correct translation in real-time, chunk by chunk. To do so, we introduce a weakly-supervised method that leverages the perplexity of an off-the-shelf text translation system to identify optimal delays on a per-word basis and create aligned synthetic data. After supervised training, Hibiki performs adaptive, simultaneous speech translation with vanilla temperature sampling. On a French-English simultaneous speech translation task, Hibiki demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in translation quality, speaker fidelity and naturalness. Moreover, the simplicity of its inference process makes it compatible with batched translation and even real-time on-device deployment. We provide examples as well as models and inference code.</description>

      <title>Predicting Global HRTFs From Scanned Head Geometry Using Deep Learning and Compact Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the growing field of virtual auditory display, personalized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) play a vital role in establishing an accurate sound image for mixed and augmented reality applications. In this work, we propose an HRTF personalization method employing convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict a subject HRTFs for all directions from their scanned head geometry. To ease the training of the CNN models, we propose novel pre-processing methods for both the head scans and HRTF data to achieve compact representations. For the head scan, we use truncated spherical cap harmonic (SCH) coefficients to represent the pinna area, which is important in the acoustic scattering process. For the HRTF data, we use truncated spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients to represent the HRTF magnitudes and onsets. One CNN model is trained to predict the SH coefficients of the HRTF magnitudes from the SCH coefficients of the scanned ear geometry and other anthropometric measurements of the head. The other CNN model is trained to predict SH coefficients of the HRTF onsets from only the anthropometric measurements of the ear, head, and torso. Combining the magnitude and onset predictions, our method is able to predict the complete and global HRTF data. A leave-one-out validation with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) metric is used for objective evaluation. The results show a decent LSD level at both spatial \&amp; temporal dimensions compared to the ground-truth HRTFs and a lower LSD than the boundary element method (BEM) simulation of HRTFs that the database provides. The localization simulation results with an auditory model are also consistent with the objective evaluation metrics, showing the localization responses with our predicted HRTFs are significantly better than with the BEM-calculated ones.</description>

      <title>SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning with Mamba State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various tasks, including audio representation learning, due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, they often suffer from quadratic complexity in both GPU memory usage and computational inference time, affecting their efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as a promising alternative, offering a more efficient approach by avoiding these complexities. Given these advantages, we explore the potential of SSM-based models in audio tasks. In this paper, we introduce Self-Supervised Audio Mamba (SSAMBA), the first self-supervised, attention-free, and SSM-based model for audio representation learning. SSAMBA leverages the bidirectional Mamba to capture complex audio patterns effectively. We incorporate a self-supervised pretraining framework that optimizes both discriminative and generative objectives, enabling the model to learn robust audio representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. We evaluated SSAMBA on various tasks such as audio classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. Our results demonstrate that SSAMBA outperforms the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) in most tasks. Notably, SSAMBA is approximately 92.7% faster in batch inference speed and 95.4% more memory-efficient than SSAST for the tiny model size with an input token size of 22k. These efficiency gains, combined with superior performance, underscore the effectiveness of SSAMBA's architectural innovation, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of audio processing applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Self-Supervised Speech Foundation Models on a Compute Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their impressive success, training foundation models remains computationally costly. This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.</description>

Abstract: People have long hoped for a conversational system that can assist in real-life situations, and recent progress on large language models (LLMs) is bringing this idea closer to reality. While LLMs are often impressive in performance, their efficacy in real-world scenarios that demand expert knowledge remains unclear. LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education, specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various prompting techniques such as zero- and few-shot method (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step), in-domain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% -&gt; 63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -&gt; 48.6%). We found that models of different sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational communication.</description>

      <title>Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms images that sound. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt.

      <title>Yeah, Un, Oh: Continuous and Real-time Backchannel Prediction with Fine-tuning of Voice Activity Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In human conversations, short backchannel utterances such as "yeah" and "oh" play a crucial role in facilitating smooth and engaging dialogue. These backchannels signal attentiveness and understanding without interrupting the speaker, making their accurate prediction essential for creating more natural conversational agents. This paper proposes a novel method for real-time, continuous backchannel prediction using a fine-tuned Voice Activity Projection (VAP) model. While existing approaches have relied on turn-based or artificially balanced datasets, our approach predicts both the timing and type of backchannels in a continuous and frame-wise manner on unbalanced, real-world datasets. We first pre-train the VAP model on a general dialogue corpus to capture conversational dynamics and then fine-tune it on a specialized dataset focused on backchannel behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods in both timing and type prediction tasks, achieving robust performance in real-time environments. This research offers a promising step toward more responsive and human-like dialogue systems, with implications for interactive spoken dialogue applications such as virtual assistants and robots.</description>

      <title>Prepending or Cross-Attention for Speech-to-Text? An Empirical Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, there is increasing interest in extending their capabilities to speech -- the most common form of communication. The most widespread approach to integrating speech into LLMs is dense feature prepending (DFP), which prepends the projected speech representations to the textual representations, allowing end-to-end training with a speech encoder. This raises questions about the need for a sophisticated speech encoder for DFP and how its performance compares with a standard encoder-decoder (i.e., cross-attention) architecture. We compare DFP and cross-attention under a variety of configurations, such as CTC compression, sequence-level knowledge distillation, on monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual models. To perform a controlled architectural comparison, we train all models from scratch rather than using large pretrained models and use comparable data and parameter settings, testing speech-to-text recognition (ASR) and translation (ST) on MuST-C v1.0 and CoVoST2 datasets. Despite the wide adoption of DFP, our results do not indicate a clear advantage of DFP over cross-attention.</description>
