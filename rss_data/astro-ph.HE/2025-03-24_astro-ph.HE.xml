      <title>Looking for the {\gamma}-Ray Cascades of the KM3-230213A Neutrino Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme energy of the KM3-230213A event could transform our understanding of the most energetic sources in the Universe. However, it also reveals an inconsistency between the KM3NeT detection and strong IceCube constraints on the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. The most congruous explanation for the KM3NeT and IceCube data requires KM3-230213A to be produced by a (potentially transient) source fortuitously located in a region where the KM3NeT acceptance is maximized. In hadronic models of ultra-high-energy neutrino production, such a source would also produce a bright {\gamma}-ray signal, which would cascade to GeV--TeV energies due to interactions with extragalactic background light. We utilize the {\gamma}-Cascade package to model the spectrum, spatial extension, and time-delay of such a source, and scan a region surrounding the KM3NeT event to search for a consistent {\gamma}-ray signal. We find no convincing evidence for a comparable \textit{Fermi}-LAT source and place constraints on a combination of the source redshift and the intergalactic magnetic field strength between the source and Earth.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the dynamics of cosmic vortices: Probing a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the jet of 3C 84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the creation of relativistic jets originating from active galactic nuclei, require a thorough understanding of the accompanying plasma instabilities. Our high sensitivity, high resolution, global very long baseline interferometry observations of the jet in the radio galaxy 3C 84 enable us to study its inner morphology, which resembles a thread-like pattern. We find that this pattern can be described by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, consisting of four instability modes. Our model favours a jet described by a Mach number of $M_\textrm{j} = 5.0\pm1.7$ and a sound speed of $\alpha_\textrm{j} = 0.14\pm0.06$. With it, we are able to describe the internal structure of 3C 84 and to tentatively connect the origin of the instability to accretion disc activity.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Shock Structures and QPOs After Halting BHL Accretion onto Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the mechanisms responsible for disk formation around the black holes is Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion.The fact that BHL accretion can be interrupted by various astrophysical phenomena, such as stellar winds or astrophysical jets, makes it crucial to study the behavior of shock cones formed by BHL accretion around black holes once the accretion process is halted. Investigating the new plasma structures that emerge in these scenarios can provide insights into observational results. In this context, a new plasma structure forming around the Kerr black hole has been numerically modeled as a function of the black hole spin parameter and the asymptotic velocity of BHL accretion. The numerical analysis revealed that high spin (a/M=0.9) and supersonic flow ( M &gt; 1) are necessary conditions for low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) formation. On the other hand, the fundamental mode of the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) are found to be independent of both the black hole spin and asymptotic velocity and are instead governed by general relativistic effects. Additionally, the study demonstrated that for 3:2 and 2:1 resonance states to form, nonlinear couplings needs to be occurred when the black hole rotates rapidly. These couplings produce harmonic frequencies, providing an explanation for the observed quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) resonances in black hole binaries. These findings align with precession models and nonlinear resonance models, both of which play a crucial role in QPO generation. Finally, the LFQPOs and HFQPOs obtained from numerical simulations are consistent with the observed QPO frequencies in the microquasars GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564, as well as in the AGN REJ1034+396, which harbors a supermassive black hole at its center.</description>

      <title>Upper limits on the gamma-ray emission from the microquasar V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a recent detection of TeV radiation by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), coincident with the direction of the microquasar V4641 Sgr, we search for possible GeV emission from this source. We explored the morphology and temporal features of the source as well as two nearby unassociated point sources which could be a part of extended structure of V4641 Sgr, and compared results with corresponding X-ray and TeV emissions. The 95% confidence level upper limits for the flux from the source, assuming both point and extended source models were 5.38$\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and 1.12$\times$ 10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. Additionally, no correlation between gamma-ray light curve and X-ray outbursts was observed.</description>

      <title>A multi-messenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within AGN J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an electromagnetic counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Insight-HXMT observations of the 2023 outburst in Aql X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted an analysis of the continuum during the onset and initial decline phases of the 2023 outburst in transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Aql X$-$1 using broadband observations from the \textit{Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT)} instrument. To determine the most appropriate model for the continuum of this outburst, we employed three models to explore the evolution of the spectral component. These observations revealed that the source transitions from the hard state to the soft state. The disk-corona and sphere-corona models both adequately described the spectra of the hard state, while the double blackbody model became preferable after the hard X-ray emission ($&gt;$25 keV) disappeared during the state transition. In the soft state, the total emission is dominated by changes in the disk and other blackbody components. The combination of the sphere-corona model and the double blackbody model is the most suitable model for this outburst. The results suggest that as the source transitioned into the soft state, the emission from the boundary layer was enhanced, and a hot spot occurred. Notably, we identified two type-I X-ray bursts, one of which exhibited a significant hard X-ray deficit (significance $\sim$ 4.82 $\sigma$), which indicates that \textit{Insight-HXMT} has the capability to capture the evolution of the corona in a single burst.</description>

      <title>Probing the Internal Structure of Neutron Stars: A Comparative Analysis of Three Different Classes of Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound speed can be an important tool in unraveling the nature of matter that exists at the cores of neutron stars. In this study, we investigate three major classes of equations of state; monotonous, non-monotonous and discontinuous depending on the nature of the sound speed in neutron stars. The monotonous EoS refers to hadronic models, the non-monotonous refers to the quarkyonic or smooth crossover models and discontinuous refers to discontinuous first-order phase transition models. We generate a large ensemble of EoS for three classes with the model agnostic speed of sound interpolation approach. Our main aim is to check which class of EoS is most favoured by present astrophysical bounds. It is seen that although non-monotonous and discontinuous is favoured thermodynamically, the usual neutron star observations like mass-radius, and f-mode oscillation fail to provide a satisfactory result. The universal relations are also seen to be futile as they show considerable spread and significant overlaps among the different classes. The Bayesian analysis shows slight bias towards the non-monotonous model but fails to provide a decisive answer.</description>

      <title>Property of downstream turbulence driven by the special relativistic shock-clump interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to investigate properties of the downstream turbulence generated by the interaction between a relativistic shock wave and multiple clumps. We analyze the properties of the downstream turbulence by performing the Helmholtz decomposition. It is shown that, in contrast to the non-relativistic shock case, the amplitude of compressive modes is comparable to that of solenoidal modes for the relativistic shock. In addition, many reflected shocks propagate in the downstream region. The strength of the compressive mode, the solenoidal mode, the reflected shock waves, and the amplified magnetic field depend on the amplitude of the upstream density fluctuations. Our simulation results suggest that the wide distribution of the ratio of the magnetic energy to the shock kinetic energy, $\epsilon_B$, in gamma-ray burst afterglows is due to the diversity of the gamma-ray burst environment. Furthermore, the inhomogeneity of density around high-energy astrophysical objects affects the spectrum of accelerated particles because the reflected shock and turbulence can inject and accelerate non-thermal particles in the shock downstream region. The probability distribution of the downstream quantities, power spectra of turbulence, and vortex generation are also analyzed and discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Investigation of X-ray emission from the unidentified TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1832-085 with Suzaku</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations conducted with H.E.S.S. at high energies have led to the discovery of numerous gamma-ray sources in the Galactic plane at TeV energies. One of these sources, HESS J1832-085, has been suggested to be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN); however, its nature is not yet fully understood. In this work, we analyze Suzaku data to investigate the X-ray spectral properties of HESS J1832-085. We found that the X-ray spectra are highly absorbed and well-represented by a power-law model with a photon index of $\Gamma \sim 1.5$, and an unabsorbed X-ray flux of $F_{\rm X} \sim 0.3 \times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2-10 keV energy band. The gamma-ray flux is approximately 66 times higher than the X-ray flux. Based on our X-ray analysis, we discuss the origin of the source HESS J1832-085. We propose that the PWN scenario is possible, although several issues still need to be resolved.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Rotating White Dwarfs and Multimessenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of numerical relativity simulations of core collapse of rotating magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) in three dimension, aiming at discussing the explosion dynamics and associate multi-messenger signals: gravitational waves (GWs), neutrinos, and electromagnetic counterparts. All WDs initiate gravitational collapse due to electron captures and then experience prompt type explosions after the proto neutron star formation. We observe the explosions dominated by a bipolar structure and the emergence of strong spiral waves in rapidly rotating models. The spiral waves facilitate to increase both the explosion energy and ejecta mass, though the final values still fall in the category of low explosion energy supernovae with small ejecta mass. The spiral waves also produce strong GWs, which may expand the horizon distance of such events against GWs up to $\sim 10$ Mpc for third-generation ground-based detectors. Additionally as an intriguing implication, we demonstrate that such accretion or merger induced collapse of WDs might be able to explain some of the rapidly evolving optical transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), as previously suggested. Based on the simulation results together with several assumptions, we confirm that the magnetar may account for the brighter side of observed FBOTs, while a combination of ejecta-envelope interaction which can be also followed by radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized along with the explosion might still explain the fainter branch even in the absence of magnetar formation.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from slowly spinning neutron stars with DECIGO, Big Bang Observer, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stably rotating highly magnetised neutron stars and glitching pulsars. We discuss the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves from these sources below 20 Hz with next-generation ground-based facilities such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and space-based observatories such as DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We demonstrate that these constitute interesting science targets. We use a robust sensitivity estimation method for future searches based on demonstrated performance. We show that the spin-down upper limit on the gravitational wave amplitude of more than 90% of all highly magnetised pulsars and magnetars suitable for a years-long fully coherent search, exceeds the smallest gravitational wave amplitude estimated detectable with DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We find that the hidden magnetar candidate PSR J1852+0040 can be detected by Cosmic Explorer if it is emitting at least at 20% of its spin-down luminosity. Finally, post-glitch transient continuous gravitational waves from magnetars are an interesting target for deci-Hz detectors, with all but one of the recorded glitches giving rise to a spin-down limit signal above the smallest detectable level.</description>

      <title>Exploring the secondary peaks of autocorrelation in black hole flare movies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong gravitational field of a black hole bends light, forming multi-level images, yet extracting precise spacetime information from them remains challenging. In this study, we investigate how gravitational lensing leaves unique and detectable signatures in black hole movies using autocorrelation analysis. By examining the two-dimensional autocorrelation of a movie depicting a hotspot orbiting a Kerr black hole, as viewed by a near-axis observer, we identify a persistent secondary peak structure induced by gravitational lensing. Notably, these secondary peaks converge to a fixed point in the time-lag domain, largely independent of the hotspot's orbital radius. This key property suggests that combining future black hole flare observations with advanced autocorrelation analysis could effectively disentangle lensing effects from orbital dynamics, enabling direct measurement of black hole parameters. Our findings establish autocorrelation as a powerful tool for probing spacetime geometry, offering new insights into gravitational physics through time-resolved black hole images.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>

      <title>High energy time lags of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive lags between the arrival time of different photon energies are commonly observed in Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), where soft photons lag behind harder ones. However, some GRBs exhibit the opposite behavior. In particular, Fermi LAT observations have revealed that high-energy photons often have a delayed onset. We explore spectral lags as a tool to identify emission components, analyzing Fermi GBM and LAT Low Energy (LLE) data. Using the Discrete Correlation Function method, we compute spectral lags in four energy bands (10 keV-100 MeV) for 70 GRBs from the LLE Catalog. Lags between 10 keV and 1 MeV are mostly positive (76%), possibly due to a hard-to-soft spectral evolution. However, lags between the LLE band (30-100 MeV) and GBM (10-100 keV) vary: 40% are positive, while 37% are negative. These negative lags suggest the delayed emergence of an additional high-energy component. Spectral analysis of 56 GRBs reveals that negative lags correspond to an LLE spectral index harder than the GBM high-energy power law. LLE spectral lags can thus serve as a diagnostic tool to identify and characterize emission components, emphasizing the importance of combining temporal and spectral analyses to better understand GRB emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On the origin of radio polarization in pulsar polar caps</title>

Abstract: A knowledge of polarization properties of coherent radio waves escaping pulsar polar caps is crucial for calculating radiative transfer through the magnetosphere and for obtaining specific predictions of observable radio properties. We describe the pair cascades in the pulsar polar cap, and for the first time, determine the Stokes parameters of the escaping radio waves from first-principle kinetic simulations for a pulsar with an inclination angle of the magnetic axis 60{\deg}.
  Our model provides a quantitative and qualitative explanation of the observed pulsar radio powers and spectra, the pulse profiles and polarization curves, their temporal variability, the strong Stokes L and weak Stokes V polarization components, as well as the fact that linear polarization decreases with frequency and the non-existence of a radius to frequency relationship. We find that the radio emission from the polar cap can produce a diverse range of observed pulsar properties, including single or double peaked profiles. Most of the Stokes V curves from our simulations appear to be antisymmetric, but symmetric curves are also present at some viewing angles. Although the PA swing of the radiation from the polar cap can be fitted by the rotating vector model (RVM) for most viewing angles, the angles obtained from the RVM do not correspond to the angular distance of the observer from the magnetic axis. Instead, the PA is directly related to the plasma flows in the polar cap and not to the dipole geometry of the magnetic field. The observed range of other polarization features, in addition to our results, can be explained by propagation effects which are not part of the simulation.
  Our simulations demonstrate that pair discharges determine the majority of its typically observed properties. The usage of RVM for estimations of the magnetic field geometry from observations needs to be reevaluated.</description>

      <title>A "Black Hole Star" Reveals the Remarkable Gas-Enshrouded Hearts of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physical processes that led to the formation of billion solar mass black holes within the first 700 million years of cosmic time remain a puzzle. Several theoretical scenarios have been proposed to seed and rapidly grow black holes, but direct observations of these mechanisms remain elusive. Here we present a source 660 million years after the Big Bang that displays singular properties: among the largest Hydrogen Balmer breaks reported at any redshift, broad multi-peaked H$\beta$ emission, and Balmer line absorption in multiple transitions. We model this source as a "black hole star" (BH*) where the Balmer break and absorption features are a result of extremely dense, turbulent gas forming a dust-free "atmosphere" around a supermassive black hole. This source may provide evidence of an early black hole embedded in dense gas -- a theoretical configuration proposed to rapidly grow black holes via super-Eddington accretion. Radiation from the BH* appears to dominate almost all observed light, leaving limited room for contribution from its host galaxy. We demonstrate that the recently discovered "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) with perplexing spectral energy distributions can be explained as BH*s embedded in relatively brighter host galaxies. This source provides evidence that black hole masses in the LRDs may be over-estimated by orders of magnitude -- the BH* is effectively dust-free contrary to the steep dust corrections applied while modeling LRDs, and the physics that gives rise to the complex line shapes and luminosities may deviate from assumptions underlying standard scaling relations.</description>

      <title>First Measurements of Black Hole Accretion and Radio-jet Timescales in a Young Quasar at the Edge of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study dedicated to measuring the timescales for black hole accretion and jet launch in a quasar at the edge of Reionization, PSO J352.4034-15.3373 at z = 5.832 $\pm$ 0.001. Previous work presented evidence of the strong radio synchrotron emission from the jet affecting the host galaxy dust-dominated continuum emission at $\nu_{\rm rest}=683$ GHz ($\nu_{\rm obs}=100$ GHz), implying a break in the synchrotron spectrum. In this work, we present quasi-simultaneous observations at 1.5\, GHz - 42\,GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and derive a frequency break at $\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm rest} = 196.46$ GHz ($\nu^{\rm break}_{\rm obs} = 28.76$ GHz). Modeling these observations, we calculate the jet spectral aging from the cooling of electrons to be $t_{\mathrm{spec}}\sim 580$ yr. From this measurement, we approximate the dynamical age $t_{\mathrm{dyn}}$ to be $\sim2,000$ yr, implying a recent jet ejection. We compare the jet timescale to the quasar's lifetime ($t_{\mathrm{Q}}$) that indicates the duration of the latest black hole accretion event and is derived from the proximity zone size in the rest-UV/optical spectrum. However, a ghostly Damped Ly$\alpha$ (DLA) system affects this measurement yielding an upper limit of $t_{\mathrm{Q}} \lesssim 10^4$ yr, consistent with the jet lifetime and indicative of a young quasar. This suggests that the triggering of a UV-bright quasar phase may occur within comparable timescales as the launch of a relativistic radio jet. Therefore, we may be witnessing an early stage of black hole and jet interactions in a quasar during the first gigayear of the universe.</description>

      <title>AREPO-IDORT: Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport for Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics on an Unstructured Moving Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is crucial not only for observing astrophysical objects, but also for transporting energy and momentum. However, accurate on-the-fly radiation transport in astrophysical simulations is challenging and computationally expensive. Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation Transport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver in the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we directly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve the time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit Jacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation time-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based methods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the advantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both optically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for the adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to support (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3) general equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used moment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately. To apply the scheme to a real astrophysics problem, we show the first global 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the entire convective envelope of a red supergiant star. (abridged) For this problem, the radiation module only takes less than half of the total computational cost. Our current scheme assumes grey radiation, is first-order accurate in both time and space (abridged). We expect our scheme will enable more accurate multi-scale radiation MHD simulations involving supersonic bulk motions, ranging from planet formation in protoplanetary disks, stars and associated transients, to accretion flows near black holes.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <title>NEIDSpecMatch: stellar parameter estimation with NEID spectra using an empirical library</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce NEIDSpecMatch, a tool developed to extract stellar parameters from spectra obtained with the NEID spectrograph. NEIDSpecMatch is based on SpecMatch-Emp and HPFSpecMatch, which estimate stellar parameters by comparing the observed spectrum to well-characterized library spectra. This approach has proven effective for M dwarfs. Utilizing a library of 78 stellar spectra covering effective temperatures from $3000-6000$ K, NEIDSpecMatch derives key parameters, including effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and projected rotational velocity. Cross-validation shows median uncertainties of $\sigma_{T_{\mathrm{eff}}} = 115\,\mathrm{K}$, $\sigma_{[\mathrm{Fe/H}]} = 0.143$, and $\sigma_{\log g} = 0.073$ across 49 orders. We showcase its application by fitting the spectrum of an M-dwarf and discuss its utility across a wide range of spectra observed with NEID. NEIDSpecMatch is pip-installable.</description>

      <title>Prompt Stellar and Binary Black Hole Mergers from Chemically Homogeneous Evolution in Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-period massive binary stars are predicted to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), making them prime candidates for producing binary black holes (BBHs) that may merge within the age of the Universe. Most of these binaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body possibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic treatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution models, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also accounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine the dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age main sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH formation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70 d(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage, leading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is avoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical triples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger a rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period. Stellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary in such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of the third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the tertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these outcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH formed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized by the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected gas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuation spectrum of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to particle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s. Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In the presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be ubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls for the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent environments.</description>

      <title>Varaha: A promising sampler for obtaining gravitational wave posteriors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nested sampling is often used in Bayesian statistics problems in astronomy. It operates with a set of live points, iteratively replacing the point with the lowest likelihood with a new point of higher likelihood. Each iteration reduces the enclosed volume by a known factor. The estimated sampling density and the likelihood values of both new and old live points quantify the enclosed probability mass. Although robust, nested sampling often discards a majority of the sampled points ($\sim 99.9\%$) at which likelihood was calculated. Here, we present an efficient method to explicitly calculate the sampling density for small dimensional problems~(ten or less), thereby removing the need to discard samples. The points' sampling density and likelihood values constitute the posterior distribution. We build on the existing version of the sampler Varaha and present an alternate version that is significantly more efficient for expensive likelihoods. These samplers specifically focus on obtaining compact binary parameters from their gravitational wave signals. They provide a viable alternative to nested sampling when the full fifteen-dimensional space is sampled separately for observer-dependent parameters and parameters intrinsic to the binary.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by numerical-relativity simulations with various mass configurations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and it collapses into a black hole only in the crossover scenario due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. Identifying these features in a variety of future events with the next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will enable us to clarify details of hadron-quark transition. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

Abstract: Hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae (SLSNe II) are rare. The exact mechanism producing their extreme light curve peaks is not understood. Analysis of single events and small samples suggest that CSM interaction is the main responsible for their features. However, other mechanisms can not be discarded. Large sample analysis can provide clarification. We aim to characterize the light curves of a sample of 107 SLSNe II to provide valuable information that can be used to validate theoretical models. We analyze the gri light curves of SLSNe II obtained through ZTF. We study peak absolute magnitudes and characteristic timescales. When possible we compute g-r colors, pseudo-bolometric light curves, and estimate lower limits for their total radiated energy. We also study the luminosity distribution of our sample and estimate the percentage of them that would be observable by the LSST. Finally, we compare our sample to other H-rich SNe and to H-poor SLSNe I. SLSNe II are heterogeneous. Their median peak absolute magnitude is -20.3 mag in optical bands. Their rise can take from two weeks to over three months, and their decline from twenty days to over a year. We found no significant correlations between peak magnitude and timescales. SLSNe II tend to show fainter peaks, longer declines and redder colors than SLSNe I. We present the largest sample of SLSNe II light curves to date, comprising of 107 events. Their diversity could be explained by considering different CSM morphologies. Although, theoretical analysis is needed to explore alternative scenarios. Other luminous transients, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, Tidal Disruption Events or SNe Ia-CSM, can easily become contaminants. Thus, good multi-wavelength light curve coverage becomes paramount. LSST could miss 30 percent of the ZTF events in the its footprint in gri bands. Redder bands become important to construct complete samples.</description>

      <title>The Third Konus-Wind Catalog of Short Gamma-Ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of 199 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Konus-Wind between 2011 January 1 and 2021 August 31. The catalog extends the Second Catalog of short gamma-ray bursts covering the period 1994-2010 by ten years of data. The resulting Konus-Wind short GRB sample includes 494 bursts. From temporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations, spectral lags, estimates of the minimum variability time scales, rise and decay times, the results of spectral fits with three model functions, the total energy fluences, and the peak energy fluxes of the bursts. We present statistical distributions of these parameters for the complete set of 494 short gamma-ray bursts detected in 1994-2021. We discuss in detail the properties of the bursts with extended emission in the context of the whole short GRB population. Finally, we consider the results in the context of the Type I (merger-origin)/Type II (collapsar-origin) classification, and discuss the extragalactic magnetar giant flare subsample.</description>

      <title>Jet Archaeology and Forecasting: Image Variability and Magnetic Field Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on event horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger scales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the magnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the variability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the magnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially narrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that propagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can provide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and conversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct observation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole. Furthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the relativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma bulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma motion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are sensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic beaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk motion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and linear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing the magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for determining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and jet-launching scales.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi Energy Neutrino Astronomy: Diagnosing Enhanced Circumstellar Material around Stripped-Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to reveal a secret birth of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a collapsing massive star using neutrinos as a unique probe. In this scheme, non-thermal TeV-scale neutrinos produced in ejecta-CSM interactions are tied with thermal MeV neutrinos emitted from a pre-explosion burning process, based on a scenario that CSM had been formed via the pre-supernova activity. Taking a representative model of the pre-supernova neutrinos, the spectrum and light curve of the corresponding high-energy CSM neutrinos are calculated at multiple mass-loss efficiencies, which are considered as a systematic uncertainty. In addition, as a part of the method demonstration, the detected event rates along time at JUNO and IceCube, as representative detectors, are estimated for the pre-supernova and CSM neutrinos, respectively, and are compared with the expected background rate at each detector. The presented method is found to be reasonably applicable for the range up to $\sim$1 kpc and even farther with future experimental efforts. The potentialities of other neutrino detectors, such as SK-Gd, Hyper-Kamiokande and KM3NeT, are also discussed. This is a pioneering work of performing astrophysics with neutrinos from diverse energy regimes, initiating multi energy neutrino astronomy in the forthcoming era where next-generation large-scale neutrino telescopes are operating.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis Conditions in Outflows of White Dwarfs Collapsing to Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) or merger-induced collapse (MIC) of white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems is an interesting path to neutron star (NS) and magnetar formation, alternative to stellar core collapse and NS mergers. Such events could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they are expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including gamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (&gt;5s post bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and velocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment scheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different masses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our simulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the proto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early neutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at later times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture supernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our rotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more neutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms around the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC and MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which may imply constraints on their occurrence rates. Finally, our simulations neglect the effects of triaxial deformation and magnetic fields, yet they provide valuable reference cases for comparison with future long-term magneto-hydrodynamic and three-dimensional AIC studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN) Mkn 590 recently underwent a sudden re-ignition, marked by substantial increases in optical/UV and X-ray continuum flux since last couple of years. Swift-XRT observations revealed the re-emergence of a soft X-ray excess (SXE) as the source transitioned from a low-flux state in July 2023 to a significantly higher flux state in October 2024. This evolution was in response to an order-of-magnitude increase in extreme-UV (EUV) continuum emission, detected by Swift-UVOT. Follow-up optical spectra from FLOYDS Faulkes confirmed the enhancement of dynamically broadened Balmer lines, He II emission, and Fe II complex. As the Eddington fraction increased by a factor of $\sim$ 20 over the last 20 months, we found clear evidence of formation of a warm corona, strongly linked to the cold accretion disc underneath. Based on our multi-wavelength study on recent data, we propose that Mkn 590 is currently becoming a Seyfert-1.2, similar to its state in 1990s.</description>

      <title>A constraint on superheavy elements of the GRB-kilonova AT 2023vfi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of the kilonova (KN) AT 2017gfo, accompanying the gravitational wave event GW170817, provides crucial insight into the synthesis of heavy elements during binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Following this landmark event, another KN was detected in association with the second-brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, GRB 230307A, and subsequently confirmed by observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work, we conduct an end-to-end simulation to analyze the temporal evolution of the KN AT 2023vfi associated with GRB 230307A, and constrain the abundances of superheavy elements produced. We find that the temporal evolution of AT 2023vfi is similar to AT 2017gfo in the first week post-burst. Additionally, the \textit{r}-process nuclide abundances of lanthanide-rich ejecta, derived from numerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers, can also successfully interpret the temporal evolution of the KN with the lanthanide-rich ejecta mass of $0.02 M_\odot$, which is consistent with the mass range of dynamical ejecta from numerical simulations in literature. Both findings strongly suggest the hypothesis that GRB 230307A originated from a BNS merger, similar to AT 2017gfo. Based on the first time observation of the KN for JWST, we are able to constrain the superheavy elements of another KN following AT 2017gfo. The pre-radioactive-decay abundances of the superheavy nuclides: $^{222}$Rn, $^{223}$Ra, $^{224}$Ra and $^{225}$Ac, are estimated to be at least on the order of $1 \times 10^{-5}$. These abundance estimates provide valuable insight into the synthesis of superheavy elements in BNS mergers, contributing to our understanding of astrophysical \textit{r}-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Dark Photons as a Solution to the GRB 221009A Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of exceptionally high-energy {\gamma}-photons (up to 18 TeV) from GRB 221009A by the LHAASO Collaboration challenges conventional physics. Photon-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillations have been proposed to explain this anomaly, but they rely on specific parameter tuning. We present an alternative explanation involving superluminal dark photons. Building on the frameworks of Markoulakis and Valamontes, we propose that dark photons facilitated faster-than-light (FTL) propagation of information, allowing {\gamma}-photons to bypass extragalactic background light (EBL) attenuation. This hypothesis aligns with cosmological observations and experimental results, including those from the LHC, providing a robust framework for addressing the GRB 221009A anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly supercooled first order phase transitions (FOPTs) can produce primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM) along with observable gravitational waves (GWs) from bubble collisions. Such FOPTs may also produce coherent magnetic fields generated by bubble collisions and by turbulence in the primordial plasma. Here we find that the requirement for PBH DM can produce large primordial magnetic fields which subsequently yield intergalactic magnetic fields in the present universe (with magnitude $\lesssim 20$ pG across coherence length scales of $\simeq 0.001$-$0.01$ Mpc, assuming maximally helical magnetic fields) that easily exceed lower bounds from blazar observations. We follow a largely model independent approach and highlight the possibility of producing DM and observable multi-messenger magnetic fields and GW signals visible in next generation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines for compact binary coalescence based on matched-filtering have reported over 90 confident detections during the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detector network. Decreasing the latency of detection, in particular for future detectors anticipated to have high detection rates, remains an ongoing effort. In this paper, we develop and test a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm for the rapid detection of GWs. We evaluate the algorithms biases and estimate its GW detection rate for an astrophysical population of binary black holes. The SDL algorithm is assessed using both, simulated data injected into the proposed A+ detector sensitivity and real data containing confident detections from the third LVK observing run. We find that our SDL algorithm can reconstruct a single binary black hole signal in less than 1 s. This suggests that SDL could be regarded as a promising approach for rapid, efficient GW detection in future observing runs of ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dynamical Nature and Radio Halo Emission of Abell 384: A Combined Radio, X-ray and Optical Study</title>

Abstract: Multiwavelength studies of galaxy clusters are crucial for understanding the complex interconnection of the thermal and non-thermal constituents of these massive structures and uncovering the physical processes involved in their formation and evolution. Here, we report a multiwavelength assessment of the galaxy cluster A384, which was previously reported to host a radio halo with a 660 kpc size at MeerKAT 1.28 GHz. The halo is slightly offset from the cluster centre. Our uGMRT observation reveals that the halo extends up to 690 kpc at 407 MHz with a nonuniform spectral index $\alpha^{1284\ \mathrm{MHz}}_{407\ \mathrm{MHz}}$ distribution varying from flat (-0.5) to steep (-1.3) values. In addition, we use legacy GMRT 608 MHz, \textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray, and the Dark Energy Survey optical observations to obtain an extensive understanding of the dynamical nature of the galaxy cluster. The X-ray surface brightness concentration parameter ($C_{\rm{SB}} = 0.16$) and centroid shift ($w = 0.057$) reveal an ongoing dynamical disturbance in the cluster. This is also supported by the elongated 2-D optical galaxy density distribution map of the cluster. The obtained centre shift between optical and X-ray peaks and the asymmetry parameter from optical analysis further supports the dynamical disturbance in the cluster. The radio and X-ray surface brightness follows a sub-linear correlation. Our observations suggest that the cluster is currently in a merging state where particle re-acceleration in the turbulent ICM resulted in the radio halo emission.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent multidimensional Penrose process driven by magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomical observations and numerical simulations are providing increasing evidence that resistive effects in plasmas around black holes play an important role in determining the phenomenology observed from these objects. In this spirit, we present a general approach to the study of a Penrose process driven by plasmoids that are produced at reconnection sites along current sheets. Our formalism is meant to determine the physical conditions that make a plasmoid-driven Penrose process energetically viable and can be applied to scenarios that are matter- or magnetic-field-dominated, that is, in magnetohydrodynamical or force-free descriptions. By exploring reconnection from an axisymmetric but curved surface, our approach can be considered genuinely multidimensional and allows us to explore conditions that are beyond the ones explored so far and that have been restricted to the equatorial plane. Furthermore, it provides a direct contact with numerical simulations of accretion onto black holes, which exhibit an intense reconnection activity outside the equatorial plane. Finally, to describe the kinematics of the plasma self-consistently, we use the well-known configuration of an equilibrium torus with a purely toroidal magnetic field. For such a torus, we discuss the existence of an ``ergobelt'', \ie a nontrivial surface penetrating the ergosphere and acting as a natural a site for the occurrence of reconnection, and from where we estimate the energetics of a plasmoid-driven Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Using nebular near-IR spectroscopy to measure asymmetric chemical distributions in 2003fg-like thermonuclear supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of three near-infrared (NIR; 1.0-2.4 $\mu$m) spectra of the SN 2003fg-like/"super-Chandrasekhar" type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) SN 2009dc, SN 2020hvf, and SN 2022pul at respective phases +372, +296, and +294~d relative to the epoch of $B$-band maximum. We find that all objects in our sample have asymmetric, or "tilted", [Fe~II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m profiles. We quantify the asymmetry of these features using five methods: velocity at peak flux, profile tilts, residual testing, velocity fitting, and comparison to deflagration-detonation transition models. Our results demonstrate that, while the profiles of the [Fe II] 1.257 and 1.644 $\mu$m features are widely varied between 2003fg-likes, these features are correlated in shape within the same SN. This implies that line blending is most likely not the dominant cause of the asymmetries inferred from these profiles. Instead, it is more plausible that 2003fg-like SNe have aspherical chemical distributions in their inner regions. These distributions may come from aspherical progenitor systems, such as double white dwarf mergers, or off-center delayed-detonation explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. Additional late-phase NIR observation of 2003fg-like SNe and detailed 3-D NLTE modeling of these two explosion scenarios are encouraged.</description>
