      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra in ${\cal N}=1\, SU(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F=N_c$ and problems with S-confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low energy mass spectra of the direct $SU(N_c)$, $\,N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD theory and its N.Seiberg's dual variant [1], are calculated in sections 2 and 3. It is shown that these two mass spectra are parametrically different, both for equal or unequal small quark masses $m_{Q,i}\neq 0$.
  In [17] the very special non-SUSY lattice $SU(N_c)$ QCD theory with $N_F=N_c$ scalar defective "quarks" was considered by E.Fradkin and S.H.Shenker. The conclusion of [17] was that the transition between the confinement and higgs regimes in this theory is the analytic crossover, not the non-analytic phase transition. And although the theory considered in [17] was very specific, the experience shows that up to now there is a widely spread opinion that this conclusion has general applicability.
  This model used in [17] is criticized in section 5 of this paper as incompatible with and qualitatively different from the standard non-SUSY $SU(N_c)$ $N_F=N_c$ QCD theory with standard scalar quarks $\phi^i_{\beta}$ with all their $2N^2_F$ real degrees of freedom. It is emphasized that this model [17] is really the Stuckelberg $SU(N_c)$ YM-theory with no dynamical electric quarks and with massive all $N_c^2-1$ electric gluons with fixed by hands nonzero masses. There is no genuine confinement in this theory, it stays permanently in the completely higgsed phase only. And this is a reason for a crossover in this theory. While in the theory with standard scalar quarks there is the phase transition between the confinement and higgs phases.
  Besides, in section 5, the arguments presented in [2] by K.Intriligator and N.Seiberg for the standard direct $SU(N_c)$, $N_F=N_c$ $\,{\cal N}=1$ SQCD in support of the crossover from [17] are criticized as erroneous.
  Besides, in section 5 a qualitative mechanism of confinement in our ordinary (i.e. not SUSY) QCD is proposed.</description>

      <title>Symmetry verification for noisy quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge theories underlie our understanding of fundamental forces of modern physics. Simulating them on quantum hardware is an outstanding challenge in the rapidly evolving field of quantum simulation. A key prerequisite is the protection of local gauge symmetries against errors that, if unchecked, would lead to unphysical results. While an extensive toolkit devoted to identifying, mitigating, and ultimately correcting such errors has been developed for Abelian groups, non-commuting symmetry operators complicate the implementation of similar schemes in non-Abelian theories. Here, we discuss two techniques for error mitigation through symmetry verification, tailored for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories implemented in noisy qudit hardware: dynamical post-selection (DPS), based on mid-circuit measurements without active feedback, and post-processed symmetry verification (PSV), which combines measurements of correlations between target observables and gauge transformations. We illustrate both approaches for the discrete non-Abelian group $D_3$ in 2+1 dimensions, explaining their usefulness for current NISQ devices even in the presence of fast fluctuating noise. Our results open new avenues for robust quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories, for further development of error-mitigation techniques, and for measurement-based control methods in qudit platforms.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the nucleon from the generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proton's internal structure is characterized not only by its charge and magnetic distribution but also by its mechanical and mass properties, which are encoded in the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These properties provide insights into the spatial distributions of energy, pressure, and shear forces within the proton. Understanding the proton's internal structure, including properties such as its mechanical and mass radii, is essential for unraveling the complex interplay between quarks and gluons that govern its stability and dynamics. In this study, we investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the proton, particularly the D-term, which encodes key information about the internal stress distribution, pressure, and shear forces within the nucleon. Using a model for skewness-dependent generalized parton distributions constructed from the double-distribution representation, we extract the quark contribution to the $ D(t) $ GFF of the EMT by analyzing available data on Compton form factors. We then employ this extracted GFF to explore the mechanical properties of the proton, including its mechanical and mass radii, as well as the internal pressure and shear force distributions. Our results provide new insights into the proton's internal structure and contribute to the broader understanding of nucleon properties.</description>

      <title>The ${\phi NN,J/\psi NN,\eta_c NN}$ systems based on HAL QCD interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of bound states and resonances in the ${\phi NN, J/\psi NN, \eta_c NN}$ systems using HAL QCD interactions for ${\phi N, J/\psi N}$, and ${\eta_c N}$. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled Schr\"odinger equation and find no resonances or bound states in the ${J/\psi NN}$ and ${\eta_c NN}$ systems. We estimate the interaction between charmonium and nuclei, concluding that the $J/\psi$ or $\eta_c$ is likely to bind with ${}^3\mathrm{H}$, ${}^3\mathrm{He}$, ${}^4\mathrm{He}$, and heavier nuclei. For the $\phi NN$ system, the lattice QCD $\phi N\left({ }^2 S_{1 / 2}\right)$ interaction is absent. We combine the $\phi p$ correlation function analysis and HAL QCD results in Model A. We assume the spin-spin interactions for $J/\psi N$ and $\phi N$ systems are inversely proportional to their masses in Model B. Model A predicts a stronger $\phi N({}^2 S_{1/2})$ interaction and permits a two-body bound state, whereas Model B suggests the interaction is attractive but too weak to form a bound state. Both models predict bound states for the $I(J^P) = 0(0^-)$ and $0(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ systems. In Model A, these states are deeply bound with binding energies exceeding 15 MeV and remain existent when considering parameter uncertainties. In contrast, these states are very loosely bound in Model B, with binding energies below 1 MeV and an existent probability of about 60\% when parameter uncertainties are considered. In both models, there exist very loosely bound $I(J^P) = 0(2^-)$ three-body states which resemble a $\phi$-d atom with the $\phi$ meson surrounding the deuteron, but their existences are sensitive to parameter uncertainties. No bound states or resonances are found in the isovector $I(J^P) = 1(1^-)$ $\phi NN$ system.</description>
