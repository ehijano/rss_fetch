      <title>Structure-preserving deflation of critical eigenvalues in quadratic eigenvalue problems associated with damped mass-spring systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial associated with a damped mass-spring system there are three types of critical eigenvalues, the eigenvalues $\infty$ and $0$ and the eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. All these are on the boundary of the set of (robustly) stable eigenvalues. For numerical methods, but also for (robust) stability analysis, it is desirable to deflate such eigenvalues by projecting the matrix polynomial to a lower dimensional subspace before computing the other eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We describe structure-preserving deflation strategies that deflate these eigenvalues via a trimmed structure-preserving linearization. We employ these results for the special case of hyperbolic problems. We also analyze the effect of a (possibly low rank) parametric damping matrix on purely imaginary eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Diff-ANO: Towards Fast High-Resolution Ultrasound Computed Tomography via Conditional Consistency Models and Adjoint Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound Computed Tomography (USCT) constitutes a nonlinear inverse problem with inherent ill-posedness that can benefit from regularization through diffusion generative priors. However, traditional approaches for solving Helmholtz equation-constrained USCT face three fundamental challenges when integrating these priors: PDE-constrained gradient computation, discretization-induced approximation errors, and computational imbalance between neural networks and numerical PDE solvers. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Diff-ANO} (\textbf{Diff}usion-based Models with \textbf{A}djoint \textbf{N}eural \textbf{O}perators), a novel framework that combines conditional consistency models with adjoint operator learning to address these limitations. Our two key innovations include: (1) a \textit{conditional consistency model} that enables measurement-conditional few-step sampling by directly learning a self-consistent mapping from diffusion trajectories, and (2) an \textit{adjoint operator learning} module that replaces traditional PDE solvers with neural operator surrogates for efficient adjoint-based gradient computation. To enable practical deployment, we introduce the batch-based Convergent Born Series (BCBS)--a memory-efficient strategy for online generation of neural operator training pairs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-ANO significantly improves both computational efficiency and reconstruction quality, especially under sparse-view and partial-view measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Acceleration of Iterative Methods for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to accelerate iterative methods to solve nonlinear Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problems using neural networks. Nonlinear eigenvector problems are fundamental in quantum mechanics and other fields, yet conventional solvers often suffer from slow convergence in extreme parameter regimes, as exemplified by the rotating Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC) problem. Our method uses a neural network to predict and refine solution trajectories, leveraging knowledge from previous simulations to improve convergence speed and accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant speed-up over classical solvers, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the approach.</description>

      <title>Entropic approximations of the semigeostrophic shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a discretisation of the semigeostrophic rotating shallow water equations, based upon their optimal transport formulation. This takes the form of a Moreau-Yoshida regularisation of the Wasserstein metric. Solutions of the optimal transport formulation provide the shallow water layer depth represented as a measure, which is itself the push forward of an evolving measure under the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. First, we propose and study an entropy regularised version of the rotating shallow water equations. Second, we discretise the regularised problem by replacing both measures with weighted sums of Dirac measures, and approximate the (squared) L2 norm of the layer depth, which defines the potential energy. We propose an iterative method to solve the discrete optimisation problem relating the two measures, and analyse its convergence. The iterative method is demonstrated numerically and applied to the solution of the time-dependent shallow water problem in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On finite precision block Lanczos computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In her seminal 1989 work, Greenbaum demonstrated that the results produced by the finite precision Lanczos algorithm after $k$ iterations can be interpreted as exact Lanczos results applied to a larger matrix, whose eigenvalues lie in small intervals around those of the original matrix. This establishes a mathematical model for finite precision Lanczos computations. In this paper, we extend these ideas to the block Lanczos algorithm. We generalize the continuation process and show that it can be completed in a finite number of iterations using carefully constructed perturbations. The block tridiagonal matrices produced after $k$ iterations can then be interpreted as arising from the exact block Lanczos algorithm applied to a larger model matrix. We derive sufficient conditions under which the required perturbations remain small, ensuring that the eigenvalues of the model matrix stay close to those of the original matrix. While in the single-vector case these conditions are always satisfiable, as shown by Greenbaum based on results by Paige, the question of whether they can always be satisfied in the block case remains open. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating a practical implementation of the continuation process and empirically assess the validity of the sufficient conditions and the size of the perturbations.</description>

      <title>Neumann series of Bessel functions in direct and inverse spherically symmetric transmission eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmission eigenvalue problem (TEP) plays a central role in inverse scattering theory. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the numerical solution of direct and inverse TEP in spherically symmetric domains with variable refractive index covering real and complex eigenvalues remains challenging. This study introduces a novel Neumann Series of Bessel Functions (NSBF) methodology to address this challenge. After reformulating the TEP as a Sturm-Liouville equation via a Liouville transformation, we expand its characteristic function in an NSBF whose coefficients are computed by simple recursive integration. In the direct problem, eigenvalues real or complex are found by root finding on a truncated NSBF partial sum, yielding high accuracy with a few coefficients, as demonstrated with various examples. For the inverse problem, we develop a two-step approach: first, recovering the transformed interval length $\delta$ from spectral data via a new NSBF-based algorithm, and second, reconstructing the refractive index $n(r)$ by solving a linear system for the first NSBF coefficients. A spectrum completion technique is also implemented to complete the spectrum and solve the corresponding inverse problem when eigenvalue data is limited. Numerical examples confirm the method's robustness and accuracy across a wide range of refractive indices, with no a priori assumptions on $\delta$ or the sign of the contrast $1-n(r)$.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Adaptive Gradient Recovery for Unstructured Finite Volume Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven approach for enhancing gradient reconstruction in unstructured finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, specifically for the 2D Euler equations. Our approach extends previous structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network. The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance, while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver. The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on the results.</description>

      <title>A Conservative and Positivity-Preserving Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Population Balance Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a conservative, positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the population balance equation (PBE), which models the distribution of particle numbers across particle sizes due to growth, nucleation, aggregation, and breakage. To ensure number conservation in growth and mass conservation in aggregation and breakage, we design a DG scheme that applies standard treatment for growth and nucleation, and introduces a novel discretization for aggregation and breakage. The birth and death terms are discretized in a symmetric double-integral form, evaluated using a common refinement of the integration domain and carefully selected quadrature rules. Beyond conservation, we focus on preserving the positivity of the number density in aggregation-breakage. Since local mass corresponds to the first moment, the classical Zhang-Shu limiter, which preserves the zeroth moment (cell average), is not directly applicable. We address this by proving the positivity of the first moment on each cell and constructing a moment-conserving limiter that enforces nonnegativity across the domain. To our knowledge, this is the first work to develop a positivity-preserving algorithm that conserves a prescribed moment. Numerical results verify the accuracy, conservation, and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A quasi-Monte Carlo multiscale method for the wave propagation in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze an accurate numerical approach to simulate the Helmholtz problem in a bounded region with a random refractive index, where the random refractive index is denoted using an infinite series parameterized by stochastic variables. To calculate the statistics of the solution numerically, we first truncate the parameterized model and adopt the quasi-Monte Carlo (qMC) method to generate stochastic variables. We develop a boundary-corrected multiscale method to discretize the truncated problem, which allows us to accurately resolve the Robin boundary condition with randomness. The proposed method exhibits superconvergence rates in the physical space (theoretical analysis suggests $\mathcal{O}(H^4)$ for $L^2$-error and $\mathcal{O}(H^2)$ for a defined $V$-error). Owing to the employment of the qMC method, it also exhibits almost the first-order convergence rate in the random space. We provide the wavenumber explicit convergence analysis and conduct numerical experiments to validate key features of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a novel solution method for nonautonomous linear ordinary fractional differential equations. The approach is based on reformulating the analytical solution using the $\star$-product, a generalization of the Volterra convolution, followed by an appropriate discretization of the resulting expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that, in certain cases, the $\star$-formalism enables the derivation of closed-form solutions, further highlighting the utility of this framework.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolding Network for Nonlinear Multi-Frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography (mfEIT) represents a promising biomedical imaging modality that enables the estimation of tissue conductivities across a range of frequencies. Addressing this challenge, we present a novel variational network, a model-based learning paradigm that strategically merges the advantages and interpretability of classical iterative reconstruction with the power of deep learning. This approach integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) within the iterative Proximal Regularized Gauss Newton (PRGN) framework. By unrolling the PRGN algorithm, where each iteration corresponds to a network layer, we leverage the physical insights of nonlinear model fitting alongside the GNN's capacity to capture inter-frequency correlations. Notably, the GNN architecture preserves the irregular triangular mesh structure used in the solution of the nonlinear forward model, enabling accurate reconstruction of overlapping tissue fraction concentrations.</description>

      <title>The inverse initial data problem for anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations via Legendre time reduction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse initial data problem for the compressible anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations, where the goal is to reconstruct the initial velocity field from lateral boundary observations. This problem arises in applications where direct measurements of internal fluid states are unavailable. We introduce a novel computational framework based on Legendre time reduction, which projects the velocity field onto an exponentially weighted Legendre basis in time. This transformation reduces the original time-dependent inverse problem to a coupled, time-independent elliptic system. The resulting reduced model is solved iteratively using a Picard iteration and a stabilized least-squares formulation under noisy boundary data. Numerical experiments in two dimensions confirm that the method accurately and robustly reconstructs initial velocity fields, even in the presence of significant measurement noise and complex anisotropic structures. This approach offers a flexible and computationally tractable alternative for inverse modeling in fluid dynamics with anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking CO$_2$ Storage Simulations: Results from the 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 11th Society of Petroleum Engineers Comparative Solution Project (shortened SPE11 herein) benchmarked simulation tools for geological carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) storage. A total of 45 groups from leading research institutions and industry across the globe signed up to participate, with 18 ultimately contributing valid results that were included in the comparative study reported here.
  This paper summarizes the SPE11. A comprehensive introduction and qualitative discussion of the submitted data are provided, together with an overview of online resources for accessing the full depth of data. A global metric for analyzing the relative distance between submissions is proposed and used to conduct a quantitative analysis of the submissions. This analysis attempts to statistically resolve the key aspects influencing the variability between submissions.
  The study shows that the major qualitative variation between the submitted results is related to thermal effects, dissolution-driven convective mixing, and resolution of facies discontinuities. Moreover, a strong dependence on grid resolution is observed across all three versions of the SPE11. However, our quantitative analysis suggests that the observed variations are predominantly influenced by factors not documented in the technical responses provided by the participants. We therefore identify that unreported variations due to human choices within the process of setting up, conducting, and reporting on the simulations underlying each SPE11 submission are at least as impactful as the computational choices reported.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Riemannian Proximal Gradient Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of (possibly strongly) geodesically convex optimization problems on Hadamard manifolds, where the objective function splits into the sum of a smooth and a possibly nonsmooth function. We introduce an intrinsic convex Riemannian proximal gradient (CRPG) method that employs the manifold proximal map for the nonsmooth step, without operating in the embedding or tangent space. A sublinear convergence rate for convex problems and a linear convergence rate for strongly convex problems is established, and we derive fundamental proximal gradient inequalities that generalize the Euclidean case. Our numerical experiments on hyperbolic spaces and manifolds of symmetric positive definite matrices demonstrate substantial computational advantages over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A robust and stable phase field method for structural topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel phase-field-based methodology for solving minimum compliance problems in topology optimization under fixed external loads and body forces. The proposed framework characterizes the optimal structure through an order parameter function, analogous to phase-field models in materials science, where the design domain and its boundary are intrinsically represented by the order parameter function. The topology optimization problem is reformulated as a constrained minimization problem with respect to this order parameter, requiring simultaneous satisfaction of three critical properties: bound preservation, volume conservation, and monotonic objective functional decay throughout the optimization process. The principal mathematical challenge arises from handling domain-dependent body forces, which necessitates the development of a constrained optimization framework. To address this, we develop an operator-splitting algorithm incorporating Lagrange multipliers, enhanced by a novel limiter mechanism. This hybrid approach guarantees strict bound preservation, exact volume conservation, and correct objective functional decaying rate. Numerical implementation demonstrates the scheme's robustness through comprehensive 2D and 3D benchmarks.</description>

      <title>From heteroclinic loops to homoclinic snaking in reversible systems: rigorous forcing through computer-assisted proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homoclinic snaking is a widespread phenomenon observed in many pattern-forming systems. Demonstrating its occurrence in non-perturbative regimes has proven difficult, although a forcing theory has been developed based on the identification of patterned front solutions. These heteroclinic solutions are themselves challenging to analyze due to the nonlinear nature of the problem. In this paper, we use computer-assisted proofs to find parameterized loops of heteroclinic connections between equilibria and periodic orbits in time reversible systems. This leads to a proof of homoclinic snaking in both the Swift-Hohenberg and Gray-Scott problems. Our results demonstrate that computer-assisted proofs of continuous families of connecting orbits in nonlinear dynamical systems are a powerful tool for understanding global dynamics and their dependence on parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.02391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present continuous-stage partitioned Runge-Kutta (csPRK) methods for energy-preserving integration of Hamiltonian systems. A sufficient condition for the energy preservation of the csPRK methods is derived. It is shown that the presented condition contains the existing condition for energy-preserving continuous-stage Runge-Kutta methods as a special case. A noticeable and interesting result is that when we use the simplifying assumptions of order conditions and the normalized shifted Legendre polynomials for constructing high-order energy-preserving csPRK methods, both the Butcher "weight" coefficients $B_\tau$ and $\widehat{B}_\tau$ must be equal to $1$. As illustrative examples, new energy-preserving integrators are acquired by virtue of the presented condition, and for the sake of verifying our theoretical results, some numerical experiments are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many practical problems can be described by second-order system $\ddot{q}=-M\nabla U(q)$, in which people give special emphasis to some invariants with explicit physical meaning, such as energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc. However, conventional numerical integrators for such systems will fail to preserve any of these quantities which may lead to qualitatively incorrect numerical solutions. This paper is concerned with the development of energy-preserving continuous-stage Runge-Kutta-Nystr\"om (csRKN) methods for solving second-order systems. Sufficient conditions for csRKN methods to be energy-preserving are presented and it is proved that all the energy-preserving csRKN methods satisfying these sufficient conditions can be essentially induced by energy-preserving continuous-stage partitioned Runge-Kutta methods. Some illustrative examples are given and relevant numerical results are reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As is well known, energy is generally deemed as one of the most important physical invariants in many conservative problems and hence it is of remarkable interest to consider numerical methods which are able to preserve it. In this paper, we are concerned with the energy-preserving integration of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems by continuous-stage methods. Algebraic conditions in terms of the Butcher coefficients for ensuring the energy preservation, symmetry and quadratic-Casimir preservation respectively are presented. With the presented condition and in use of orthogonal expansion techniques, the construction of energy-preserving integrators is examined. A new class of energy-preserving integrators which is symmetric and of order $2m$ is constructed. Some numerical results are reported to verify our theoretical analysis and show the effectiveness of our new methods.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two types of variational integrators, one originating from the discrete Hamilton's principle while the other from Galerkin variational approach. It turns out that these variational integrators are equivalent to each other when they are used for integrating the classical mechanical system with Lagrangian function $L(q,\dot{q})=\frac{1}{2}\dot{q}^TM\dot{q}-U(q)$ ($M$ is an invertible symmetric constant matrix). They are symplectic, symmetric, possess super-convergence order $2s$ (which depends on the degree of the approximation polynomials), and can be related to continuous-stage partitioned Runge-Kutta methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the numerical solution of conservation laws in the two dimensional case using a novel compact implicit time discretization that enables applications of fast algebraic solvers. We present details for the second order accurate parametric scheme based on the finite volume method including simple variants of ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) approximations. To avoid oscillatory numerical solutions for large time steps, we propose limiting in time which is provable non-oscillatory in the case of linear advection equation with variable velocity. We present numerical experiments for representative linear and nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate Solver for the Fractional Fokker-Planck Equation with Dirac-Delta Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is a key tool in physics for describing systems influenced by drag forces and Gaussian noise, with applications spanning multiple fields. We consider the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), which models the time evolution of probability densities for systems driven by L\'evy processes, relevant in scenarios where Gaussian assumptions fail. The paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical approach for the free-space FFPE with constant coefficients and Dirac-delta initial conditions. This method utilizes the integral representation of the solutions and enables the efficient handling of very high-dimensional problems using fast algorithms. Our work is the first to present a high-precision numerical solver for the free-space FFPE with Dirac-delta initial conditions. In addition to Dirac-delta initial data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for initial conditions given by sums of Gaussians. This opens the door for future research on more complex scenarios, including those with variable coefficients and other types of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Advection-Dominated Flows with Space-Local Reduced-Order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are often used to accelerate the simulation of large physical systems. However, traditional ROM techniques, such as those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), often struggle with advection-dominated flows due to the slow singular value decay. This results in high computational costs and potential instabilities.
  This paper proposes a novel approach using space-local POD to address the challenges arising from the slow singular value decay. Instead of global basis functions, our method employs local basis functions that are applied across the domain, analogous to the finite element method, but with a data-driven basis. By dividing the domain into subdomains and applying the space-local POD, we achieve a representation that is sparse and that generalizes better outside the training regime. This allows the use of a larger number of basis functions compared to standard POD, without prohibitive computational costs. To ensure smoothness across subdomain boundaries, we introduce overlapping subdomains inspired by the partition of unity method.
  Our approach is validated through simulations of the 1D and 2D advection equation. We demonstrate that using our space-local approach we obtain a ROM that generalizes better to flow conditions which are not part of the training data. In addition, we show that the constructed ROM inherits the energy conservation and non-linear stability properties from the full-order model. Finally, we find that using a space-local ROM allows for larger time steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of the Virtual Element Method concepts to solve scalar and system hyperbolic problems on general polygonal grids. The new schemes stem from the active flux approach \cite{AF1}, which combines the usage of point values at the element boundaries with an additional degree of freedom representing the average of the solution within each control volume. Along the lines of the family of residual distribution schemes introduced in \cite{Abgrall_AF,abgrall2023activefluxtriangularmeshes} \red{that integrate the active flux technique}, we devise novel third order accurate methods that rely on the VEM technology to discretize gradients of the numerical solution by means of a polynomial-free approximation, \red{by} adopting a virtual basis that is locally defined for each element. The obtained discretization is globally continuous, and for nonlinear problems it needs a stabilization which is provided by \new{a monolithic convex limiting strategy extended from \cite{Abgrall_BP_PAMPA}}. This is applied to both point and average values of the discrete solution. We show applications to scalar problems, as well as to the acoustics and Euler equations in two dimension. The accuracy and the robustness of the proposed schemes are assessed against a suite of benchmarks involving smooth solutions, shock waves and other discontinuities.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the thermo-poroelasticity model. By introducing an intermediate variable, we transform the original three-field model into a four-field model. Building upon this four-field model, we present both a coupled finite element method and a decoupled iterative finite element method. We prove the stability and optimal convergence of the coupled finite element method. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the decoupled iterative method. This paper focuses primarily on analyzing the iterative decoupled algorithm. It demonstrates that the algorithm's convergence does not require any additional assumptions about physical parameters or stabilization parameters. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and theoretical validity of these new methods.</description>

Abstract: We provide a finite element discretization of $\ell$-form-valued $k$-forms on triangulation in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for general $k$, $\ell$ and $n$ and any polynomial degree. The construction generalizes finite element Whitney forms for the de~Rham complex and their higher-order and distributional versions, the Regge finite elements and the Christiansen--Regge elasticity complex, the TDNNS element for symmetric stress tensors, the MCS element for traceless matrix fields, the Hellan--Herrmann--Johnson (HHJ) elements for biharmonic equations, and discrete divdiv and Hessian complexes in [Hu, Lin, and Zhang, 2025]. The construction discretizes the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG) diagrams. Applications of the construction include discretization of strain and stress tensors in continuum mechanics and metric and curvature tensors in differential geometry in any dimension.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Second-Order Adaptive Procedure for Inserting CAD Geometries into Hexahedral Meshes using Volume Fractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with inserting three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) geometries into meshes composed of hexahedral elements using a volume fraction representation. An adaptive procedure for doing so is presented. The procedure consists of two steps. The first step performs spatial acceleration using a k-d tree. The second step involves subdividing individual hexahedra in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-like fashion and approximating the CAD geometry linearly (as a plane) at the finest subdivision. The procedure requires only two geometric queries from a CAD kernel: determining whether or not a queried spatial coordinate is inside or outside the CAD geometry and determining the closest point on the CAD geometry's surface from a given spatial coordinate. We prove that the procedure is second-order accurate for sufficiently smooth geometries and sufficiently refined background meshes. We demonstrate the expected order of accuracy is achieved with several verification tests and illustrate the procedure's effectiveness for several exemplar CAD geometries.</description>

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) with low-regularity solutions pose significant challenges for traditional numerical methods, particularly in complex geometries where mesh generation and adaptive refinement become computationally expensive. While deep-learning-based approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM), offer mesh-free alternatives, they often lack adaptive resolution in critical regions, limiting their accuracy for solutions with steep gradients or singularities. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Feature Capture Method (AFCM), a novel machine learning framework that adaptively redistributes neurons and collocation points in high-gradient regions to enhance local expressive power. Inspired by adaptive moving mesh techniques, AFCM employs the gradient norm of an approximate solution as a monitor function to guide the reinitialization of feature function parameters. This ensures that partition hyperplanes and collocation points cluster where they are most needed, achieving higher resolution without increasing computational overhead. The AFCM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with near-singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in accurately resolving low-regularity problems, even in complex geometries. By bridging the gap between adaptive mesh refinement and randomized neural networks, AFCM offers a robust and scalable approach for solving challenging PDEs in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Exponential Runge-Kutta Galerkin finite element method for a reaction-diffusion system with nonsmooth initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical analysis of the Field-Noyes reaction-diffusion model with nonsmooth initial data, employing a linear Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization and a second-order exponential Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration. The initial data are assumed to reside in the fractional Sobolev space H^gamma with 0 &lt; gamma &lt; 2, where classical regularity conditions are violated, necessitating specialized error analysis. By integrating semigroup techniques and fractional Sobolev space theory, sharp fully discrete error estimates are derived in both L2 and H1 norms. This demonstrates that the convergence order adapts to the smoothness of initial data, a key advancement over traditional approaches that assume higher regularity. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Port-Hamiltonian Realizations of Nonminimal Linear Time Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods for developing port-Hamiltonian representations of general linear time-invariant systems are studied. The approach extends previous port-Hamiltonian characterizations to include the general non-minimal case and the case where the feedthrough term fails to have an invertible symmetric part. The resulting construction is able to identify infeasibility when the system fails to be port-Hamiltonian, and allows for the incorporation of perturbations in order to arrive at a nearby port-Hamiltonian system. Results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projection operators are important in Analysis, Optimization and Algorithm. It is well known that these operators are firmly nonexpansive. In this paper, we provide an exact result that sharpens this well-known result. We develop the theory of averaged operators and provide a lower bound. We give a result on the avergedness of operator compositions. We also provide some nonlinear examples to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Are Universal PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as promising tools to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits their generalization to diverse PDEs, preventing them from being practical surrogate models of numerical solvers. In this paper, we present Unisolver, a novel Transformer model trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs, aiming towards a universal neural PDE solver capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs that a PDE solution is fundamentally governed by a series of PDE components such as equation symbols and boundary conditions, we define a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise and point-wise deep conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive performance and generalizability.

      <title>On low frequency inference for diffusions without the hot spots conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We remove the dependence on the `hot-spots' conjecture in two of the main theorems of the recent paper of Nickl (2024, Annals of Statistics). Specifically, we characterise the minimax convergence rates for estimation of the transition operator $P_{f}$ arising from the Neumann Laplacian with diffusion coefficient $f$ on arbitrary convex domains with smooth boundary, and further show that a general Lipschitz stability estimate holds for the inverse map $P_f\mapsto f$ from $H^2\to H^2$ to $L^1$.</description>

      <title>On the Minimal Denominator Problem in Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the minimal denominator problem in function fields. In particular, we compute the probability distribution function of the the random variable which returns the degree of the smallest denominator $Q$, for which the ball of a fixed radius around a point contains a rational function of the form $\frac{P}{Q}$. Moreover, we discuss the distribution of the random variable which returns the denominator of minimal degree, as well as higher dimensional and $P$-adic generalizations. This can be viewed as a function field generalization of a paper by Chen and Haynes.</description>

      <title>On the time integration for phase field modeling of grain growth in additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase field simulations play a key role in the understanding of microstructure evolution in additive manufacturing. However, they have been found extremely computationally expensive. One of the reasons is the small time step requirement to resolve the complex microstructure evolution during the rapid solidification process. This paper investigates the possibility of using a class of stabilized time integration algorithms to accelerate such phase field simulations by increasing the time steps. The specific time integration formulation and theoretical analysis on energy stability were developed, based on a phase field model dedicated to simulating rapid solidification in additive manufacturing. The numerical results confirmed that the proposed method can ensure the numerical stability and a decreasing energy requirement for the phase field simulations with at least two orders-of-magnitude larger time steps over conventional explicit methods. 2D and 3D phase field simulations have been conducted with relevant physical and kinetic parameters for 316L stainless steels. This work provides a numerical framework for efficient phase field simulations and open numerous opportunities for large scale phase field modeling.</description>
