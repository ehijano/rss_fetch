      <title>Presence of a Spatially Varying Electric Field at Lipid-Water Interface with Na/K ratio in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion-lipid interface in Langmuir monolayers of Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) on pure water and 10 mM solutions of Na+ and K+ at different [K+]/[Na+] (a), atom/atom ratios, were studied initially by Surface Pressure (p) versus Specific Molecular Area (A) isotherms. The values of a were chosen as 0 (no K+), 0.43 ([K+]:[Na+] = 30:70) and 1.0 ([K+]:[Na+] = 50:50) These monolayers were studied through X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR) and Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the O K-edge. The two-dimensional rigidity of the monolayer was found to increase with Na+ ions with respect to the pristine monolayer but fall drastically and non-linearly below the pristine value with introduction of the K+ ions, as a was increased. Analysis of the XRR profiles provided the thickness, average electron density (aed) and the interfacial roughness of the phosphatidylcholine head group and the two hydrocarbon tails of the monolayers on Si (001), from which the angle (f) between the head and the tails was determined. This was also follow the same as former one. From NEXAFS, it was found that a linear increase in the cation ratio towards K led to a nonlinear variation in the P=O bond energy and a weakening of the P-O bond energy, the latter becoming more pronounced with K ions, consistent with Fajans rule. Also a split in the C=O p-bond peak was observed at a = 1.0. These results cannot be explained with the model of a uniform electric field due to the cations, which would fall linearly with increase in the K+ proportion, and rather suggest a structured field due a spatial variation in charge density in an interfacial layer of high ion concentration assembled by the counterionic attraction of the phosphatidylcholine head groups. Our results have important implications for the cell membrane, where such mixtures at high concentrations constitute the norm.</description>

      <title>Efficiency and Characteristics of MICP in Environments with Elevated Salinity, Diminished Oxygen, and Lowered Temperature: A Microfluidics Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) shows promise for enhancing soil strength, but environmental factors significantly affect its mechanisms. The feasibility of MICP in challenging conditions, such as the soil around piles in shallow seabeds during winter,characterized by high salinity, low oxygen, and cold temperatures,remains uncertain due to limited research. To address this gap, we employed microfluidic techniques and advanced measurement tools, including Raman spectroscopy and SEM, to assess how these conditions influence bacterial growth, calcium carbonate crystallization, and porous medium permeability through MICP.Our findings indicate that cold temperatures notably hinder bacterial growth, while high salinity and low oxygen also play critical roles, particularly reducing bacterial attachment. In seawater environments, high salinity and cold temperatures significantly affect calcium carbonate crystal shape and type; low oxygen has a lesser impact. Specifically, high salinity reduces crystal quantity by 20.2% with minimal effect on diameter, while low oxygen increases diameter by 20.3% but decreases quantity by 50.9%. Cold temperatures decrease diameter by 36.9% without much effect on quantity.After six injections of the cementation solution, MICP treated samples showed a chemical transformation efficiency of 20.6% compared to DI water, primarily due to cold temperatures (contributing 40.1%). An exponential decline in permeability with increasing calcium carbonate content was observed, leading to the categorization of calcium carbonate generation into fast and slow decay types. This study provides insights for optimizing mineralization in marine conditions and emphasizes how environmental factors impact MICP performance, presenting challenges for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive optimization study of Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) for soil strength enhancement: impact of biochemical and environmental factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) is a biocementation technique that modifies the hydraulic and mechanical properties of porous materials using bacterial solutions. This study evaluates the efficiency of various MICP protocols under different environmental conditions, utilizing two bacterial strains: S. pasteurii and S. aquimarina, to optimize soil strength. Results indicate that bacterial strain and cementation solution concentration significantly affect biochemical outcomes, while temperature is the primary environmental factor. The efficiency of S. pasteurii's chemical conversion ranged from 40% to 80%, compared to only about 20% for S. aquimarina. MICP treatment with S. pasteurii produced CaCO3 content between 5% and 7%, whereas S. aquimarina yielded 0.5% to 1.5%. An optimized cementation solution concentration of 0.5 M was critical for maximum efficiency. The ideal operational temperature is between 20 and 35C, with salinity and oxygen levels having minimal effects. Although salinity influences carbonate crystal characteristics, its impact on Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) of treated soil is minor. Samples from a one-phase treatment at pH 6.0 to 7.5 showed UCS strength approximately half that of a two phase treatment. These findings suggest promising applications for MICP in enhancing strength in both terrestrial and marine environments.</description>

      <title>Role of intercellular adhesion in modulating tissue fluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning cell rearrangements is essential in collective cell movement that underlies cancer progression, wound repair, and embryonic development. A key question is how tissue material properties and morphology emerge from cellular factors such as cell-cell adhesion. Here, we introduce a two-dimensional active force-based model of tissue monolayers that captures the liquid-to-solid transition exhibited by tissues. Unlike the Vertex and Voronoi models, our model shows that reducing intercellular adhesion in near-confluent tissues leads to spontaneous neighbor exchanges and fluidization. Near the liquid-solid phase boundary, we also found glassy behavior characterized by subdiffusive dynamics, swirling cell motion, and non-Gaussian exponential tails in displacement distributions. These exponential tails collapse onto a single master curve, suggesting a universal 'diffusion length' in the glassy regime. Notably, we demonstrate that structural parameters based on cell shape cannot always distinguish tissue phases due to huge cell shape fluctuations that are not observed in Vertex and Voronoi models. Our general simulation framework streamlines previous approaches by removing many arbitrary features and can reproduce known model behaviors under different conditions, offering potential applications in developmental biology and physiology.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Interface Laws of Turing Mixtures and Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For cellular functions like division and polarization, protein pattern formation driven by NTPase cycles is a central spatial control strategy. Operating far from equilibrium, no general theory links microscopic reaction networks and parameters to the pattern type and dynamics. We discover a generic mechanism giving rise to an effective interfacial tension organizing the macroscopic structure of non-equilibrium steady-state patterns. Namely, maintaining protein-density interfaces by cyclic protein attachment and detachment produces curvature-dependent protein redistribution which straightens the interface. We develop a non-equilibrium Neumann angle law and Plateau vertex conditions for interface junctions and mesh patterns, thus introducing the concepts of ``Turing mixtures'' and ``Turing foams''. In contrast to liquid foams and mixtures, these non-equilibrium patterns can select an intrinsic wavelength by interrupting an equilibrium-like coarsening process. Data from in vitro experiments with the E. coli Min protein system verifies the vertex conditions and supports the wavelength dynamics. Our study uncovers interface laws with correspondence to thermodynamic relations that arise from distinct physical processes in active systems. It allows the design of specific pattern morphologies with potential applications as spatial control strategies in synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Active morphodynamics of intracellular organelles in the trafficking pathway</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the Golgi apparatus to endosomes, organelles in the endomembrane system exhibit complex and varied morphologies that are often related to their function. Such membrane-bound organelles operate far from equilibrium due to directed fluxes of smaller trafficking vesicles; the physical principles governing the emergence and maintenance of these structures have thus remained elusive. By understanding individual fission and fusion events in terms of active mechano-chemical cycles, we show how such trafficking manifests at the hydrodynamic scale, resulting not only in fluxes of material -- such as membrane area and encapsulated volume -- but also in active stresses that drive momentum transfer between an organelle and its cytosolic environment. Due to the fluid and deformable nature of the bounding membrane, this gives rise to novel physics, coupling nonequilibrium forces to organelle composition, morphology and hydrodynamic flows. We demonstrate how both stable compartment drift and ramified sac-like morphologies, each reminiscent of Golgi-cisternae, emerge naturally from the same underlying nonequilibrium dynamics of fission and fusion.</description>

      <title>Robust assessment of asymmetric division in colon cancer cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric partition of fate determinants during cell division is a hallmark of cell differentiation. Recent works suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical frameworks. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promise to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Automata: Harnessing Kinetic-Thermodynamic Discrepancy for Temporal Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular-scale computation is crucial for smart materials and nanoscale devices, yet creating single-molecule systems capable of complex computations remains challenging. We present a theoretical framework for a single-molecule computer that performs temporal pattern recognition and complex information processing. Our approach introduces the concept of an energy seascape, extending traditional energy landscapes by incorporating control parameter degrees of freedom. By engineering a kinetic-thermodynamic discrepancy in folding dynamics, we demonstrate that a linear polymer with $N$ binary-state foldable units can function as a deterministic finite automaton, processing $2^N$ configurations. The molecule's dominant configuration evolves deterministically in response to mechanical signals, enabling recognition of complex temporal patterns. This design allows complete state controllability through non-equilibrium driving protocols. Our model opens avenues for molecular-scale computation with applications in biosensing, smart drug delivery, and adaptive materials. We discuss potential experimental realizations using DNA nanotechnology. This work bridges the gap between information processing devices and stochastic molecular systems, paving the way for sophisticated molecular computers rivaling biological systems in complexity and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-induced phase separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller-Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the full rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion similar to the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and providing a basis for the analysis of more complex multi-species chemotactic systems.</description>

      <title>Flow associated with Lighthill's elongated-body theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic forces acting on an undulating swimming fish consist of two components: a drag-based resistive force and a reactive force originating from the necessary acceleration of an added mass of water. Lighthill's elongated-body theory, based on potential flow, provides a framework for calculating this reactive force. By leveraging the high aspect ratio of most fish, the theory simplifies the problem into a series of independent two-dimensional slices of fluids along the fish's body, which exchange momentum with the body and neighbouring slices. Using momentum conservation arguments, Lighthill's theory predicts the total thrust generated by an undulating fish, based solely on the dimensions and kinematics of its caudal fin. However, the assumption of independent slices has led to the common misconception that the flow produced lacks a longitudinal component. In this paper, we revisit Lighthill's theory, offering a modern reinterpretation using essential singularities of potential flows. We then extend it to predict the full three-dimensional flow field induced by the fish's body motion. Our results compare favourably with numerical simulations of realistic fish geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and theoretically investigate a minimal particle-based model for a new class of active matter where particles exhibit directional, volume-conserving division in confinement while interacting sterically, mimicking cells in early embryogenesis. We find that complex motion, synchronized within division cycles, displays strong collective effects and becomes self-similar in the long-time limit. Introducing the method of normalized retraced trajectories, we show that the transgenerational motion caused by cell division can be mapped to a time-inhomogenous random walk with an exponentially decreasing length scale. Analytical predictions for this stochastic process allow us to extract effective parameters, indicating unusual effects of crowding and absence of jamming. Robustness of our findings against desynchronized divisions, cell size dispersity, and variations in confinement hints at universal behavior. Our results establish an understanding of complex dynamics exhibited by isovolumentric division over long timescales, paving the way for new bioengineering strategies and perspectives on living matter.</description>

Robotics research devised many strategies. However, we do not well understand how the physical principles of how the need to generate mechanical energy to overcome the potential energy barrier governs behavioral strategies and 3-D body rotations given the morphology. Here I review progress on this which I led studying cockroaches self-righting on level, flat, solid, low-friction ground, by integrating biology experiments, robotic modeling, and physics modeling.</description>

      <title>Universal Aspects of Barrier Crossing Under Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal activation process by which a system passes from one local energy minimum to another is a recurring motif in physics, chemistry, and biology. For instance, biopolymer chains are typically modeled in terms of energy landscapes, with folded and unfolded conformations represented by two distinct wells separated by a barrier. The rate of transfer between wells depends primarily on the height of the barrier, but it also depends on the details of the shape of the landscape along the trajectory. We consider the case of bias due to an external force, analogous to the pulling force applied in optical tweezer experiments on biopolymers. Away from the Arrhenius-law limit and well out of equilibrium, somewhat idiosyncratic behavior might be expected. Instead, we identify universal behavior of the biased activated-barrier-crossing process and demonstrate that data collapse onto a universal curve can be achieved for simulated data over a wide variety of energy landscapes having barriers of different height and shape and for loading rates spanning many orders of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Nonequilibrium systems, in particular living organisms, are maintained by irreversible transformations of energy that drive diverse functions. Quantifying their irreversibility, as measured by energy dissipation, is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms. However, existing techniques usually overlook experimental limitations, either by assuming full information or by employing a coarse-graining method that requires knowledge of the structure behind hidden degrees of freedom. Here, we study the inference of dissipation from finite-resolution measurements by employing a recently developed model-free estimator that considers both the sequence of coarse-grained transitions and the waiting time distributions: $\sigma_2=\sigma_2^\ell + \sigma_2^t$. The dominant term $\sigma_2^\ell$ originates from the sequence of observed transitions; we find that it scales with resolution following a power law. Comparing the scaling exponent with a previous estimator highlights the importance of accounting for flux correlations at lower resolutions. $\sigma_2^t$ comes from asymmetries in waiting time distributions. It is non-monotonic in resolution, with its peak position revealing characteristic scales of the underlying dissipative process, consistent with observations in the actomyosin cortex of starfish oocytes. Alternatively, the characteristic scale can be detected in a crossover of the scaling of $\sigma_2^\ell$. This provides a novel perspective for extracting otherwise hidden characteristic dissipative scales directly from dissipation measurements. We illustrate these results in biochemical models as well as complex networks. Overall, this study highlights the significance of resolution considerations in nonequilibrium systems, providing insights into the interplay between experimental resolution, entropy production, and underlying complexity.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>

Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>
