      <title>Bird's-eye view to the realm of N_{TB} liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we start with an introductory review of the relatively recently discovered type of liquid crystals, twist-bend nematics N_{TB}. Then we describe a more detailed account of recent developments in the field. Namely: (i) Landau Theory of the easy axis N_{TB} nematics; (ii) Light scattering in the N_{TB} liquid crystals; (iii) Rheological behavior of the ordered N_{TB} samples; (iv) Shift of the N - N_{TB} phase transition point (where N stands for the conventional nematic liquid crystal) under actions of external fields. It is found that advocated in this work simple phenomenological approach successfully explains available experimental data. The paper integrates the input from publications of other researchers, and presents a personal view of the author formed partially by his own results and discussions with his collaborators.</description>

      <title>Flow of supercooled liquids under dipolar force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscosity of supercooled liquids notably increases with decreasing temperature, leading to solidification through a glass transition. This process is accompanied by dynamic heterogeneity, characterized by persistent dynamic spatial correlations. This study investigates how dynamic heterogeneity influences the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations to the flow of supercooled liquids. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we subjected a two-dimensional supercooled liquid to a localized dipolar force field and compared the resulting steady velocity field with the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Our approach captures a significant breakdown of the Navier-Stokes equations in real space; specifically, supercooled liquids flow more rapidly near the external force than the prediction from the Navier-Stokes equations. Furthermore, this deviation is enhanced by the supercooling and is accompanied by the growth of dynamic heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Entropy of state transitions in macroscopic active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of thermodynamic principles to active matter remains a challenge due to the non-equilibrium nature inherent to active systems. In this study, we introduce a framework to assess entropy in our minimal macroscopic experiment based on the utilized degrees of freedom. Using motorized spheres as active particles, we demonstrate that the system transitions between distinct active states. Analogous to the phase transition in classic solids, liquids, and gases, each phase is characterized by a quantifiable change in entropy. We show that the corresponding phase transitions are accompanied by discrete jumps in entropy, resulting from newly utilized degrees of freedom. Our findings reveal that active matter can exhibit phase transitions analogous to classical thermodynamic systems, quantifiable in terms of their entropy and temperature. By bridging equilibrium thermodynamics and active matter, this work shows how underlying principles extend to complex, living systems.</description>

      <title>Self-organization and memory in an amorphous solid subject to random loading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider self-organization and memory formation of a sheared amorphous solid subject to a random shear strain protocol confined to a strain range $\pm \varepsilon_{\rm max}$. We show that, as in the case of applied cyclic shear, the response of the driven system retains a memory of the strain range that can subsequently be retrieved. Our findings suggest that self-organization and memory formation of disordered materials can emerge under more general conditions, such as a system interacting with its fluctuating environment.</description>

      <title>Thermo-mechanical Properties of Hierarchical Biocomposite Materials from Photosynthetic Microorganisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrusion 3D-printing of biopolymers and natural fiber-based biocomposites allows for the fabrication of complex structures, ranging from gels for healthcare applications to eco-friendly structural materials. However, traditional polymer extrusion demands high-energy consumption to pre-heat the slurries and reduce material viscosity. Additionally, natural fiber reinforcement often requires harsh treatments to improve adhesion to the matrix. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a systematic framework to fabricate natural biocomposite materials via a sustainable and scalable process. Using Chlorella vulgaris microalgae as the matrix, we optimize the bioink composition and the 3D-printing process to fabricate multifunctional, lightweight, hierarchical materials. A systematic dehydration approach prevents cracking and failure of the 3D-printed structure, maintaining a continuous morphology of aggregated microalgae cells that can withstand high shear forces during processing. Hydroxyethyl cellulose acts as a binder and reinforcement for Chlorella cells, leading to biocomposites with a bending stiffness above 1.5 GPa. The Chlorella biocomposites demonstrate isotropic heat transfer, functioning as effective thermal insulators with a thermal conductivity of 0.10 W/mK at room temperature. These materials show promise in applications requiring balanced thermal insulation and structural capabilities, positioning them as a sustainable alternative to conventional materials in response to increasing global materials demand.</description>

      <title>A random planting model</title>

Abstract: The adoption of agroecological practices will be crucial to address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Such practices favor the cultivation of plants in complex mixtures with layouts differing from the monoculture approach of conventional agriculture. Inspired by random sequential adsorption processes, we propose a one-dimensional model in which the plants are represented as line segments that start as points and grow at a constant rate until they reach length $\sigma$ after a time interval $\tau$. The planting positions and times are randomly chosen with the constraint that plant overlap is forbidden. We apply an exact, event-driven simulation to investigate the resulting spatiotemporal patterns and yields in both mono- and duocultures. After a transient period, with oscillations in the density and coverage, the field reaches a steady state in which the mean age of plants is one half of the time to maturity. The structure of the active plants is characterized by correlation functions between the fluctuation of the age of a plant and its $k$th neighbour. Nearest neighbours are negatively correlated, while next nearest neighbours tend to have similar ages. The steady state yield increases with the planting rate and approaches a maximum value of 4/3 plants per unit length per unit time. For two species with the same size at maturity but different growth rates, the more slowly growing species is enriched in the harvest compared to the seed mix composition. If two species have the same time to maturity but different sizes, the smaller one is enriched in the harvest and, at a sufficiently high planting rate, the larger species may be completely absent. For two species with the same ratio of $\sigma/\tau$ the selectivity is insensitive to the planting rate. The model may be extended to higher dimensions, more species and other planting strategies.</description>

      <title>Optothermal Revolution: Colloids in an Optical Ring Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional motion is commonly observed in various living active systems, such as bacterial colonies moving through confined environments. In these systems, the dynamics arise from the collective effects of mutual interactions between individual elements, as well as their interactions with obstacles or boundaries. In this study, we turn our focus to an artificial system and experimentally investigate the emergence of directional revolution in dimer and trimer structures composed of colloidal particles in ring-shaped optical illumination. In this case, the movement of these colloidal structures is exclusively facilitated by optothermal interactions without any direct mechanical force applied from the external optical field. Depending on the optical absorption properties of the colloidal particles, these optothermal interactions can exhibit both attractive and repulsive characteristics. The attractive interactions provide the necessary driving force that propels the motion, while the repulsive interactions serve to control the structural parameters of the system. The arrangement and interaction of the colloidal particles within these dimer and trimer structures fuel the controlled, directional revolution, with the optical gradient force acting as a confining factor, guiding the movement along a specific path. Notably, the dynamics of these systems can be tuned by altering the intensity of the optical field. This study can be useful as a model for understanding insights into biological systems where group dynamics and environmental interactions are key to coordinated movement.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle in one-dimensional potentials: mean first-passage time and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP), which is a prototypical model for active system, moving within an arbitrary external potential. Using backward Fokker-Planck equations, we derive the differential equation satisfied by its mean first-passage time (MFPT) to an absorbing target, which, without any loss of generality, is placed at the origin. Depending on the shape of the potential, we identify four distinct ``phases'', with a corresponding expression for the MFPT in every case, which we derive explicitly. To illustrate these general expressions, we derive explicit formulae for two specific cases which we study in detail: a double-well potential and a logarithmic potential. We then present different applications of these general formulae to (i) the generalization of the Kramer's escape law for an RTP in the presence of a potential barrier, (ii) the ``trapping'' time of an RTP moving in a harmonic well and (iii) characterizing the efficiency of the optimal search strategy of an RTP subjected to stochastic resetting. Our results reveal that the MFPT of an RTP in an external potential exhibits a far more complex and, at times, counter-intuitive behavior compared to that of a passive particle (e.g., Brownian) in the same potential.</description>

      <title>What do clever algorithms for glasses do? Time reparametrization at work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tuning energy dissipation via topologically electro-convoluted lipid-membrane boundary layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that friction between surfaces bearing phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers can be increased by two orders of magnitude or more via an externally-applied electric field, and that this increase is fully reversible when the field is switched off. While this striking effect holds promising application potential, its molecular origin remains unknown due to difficulty in experimentally probing confined membrane structure at a molecular level. Our earlier molecular dynamics simulations revealed the equilibrium electroporated structure of such confined lipid membranes under an electric field; here we extend this approach to study the associated sliding friction between two solid surfaces across such PC bilayers. We identify the enhanced friction in the field as arising from membrane undulations due to the electroporation; this leads to some dehydration at the lipid-water interfaces, leading to closer contact and thus increased attraction between the zwitterionic headgroups, which results in increased frictional dissipation between the bilayers as they slide past each other. Additionally, the electric field facilitates formation of lipid bridges spanning the intersurface gap; at the sliding velocities of the experiments, these bridges increase the friction by topologically-forcing the slip-plane to pass through the acyl tail-tail interface, associated with higher dissipation during sliding. Our results account quantitatively for the experimentally-observed electro-modulated friction with boundary lipid bilayers, and indicate more generally how they may affect interactions between contacting surfaces, where high local transverse fields may be ubiquitous.</description>

      <title>Flow dichroism of DNA can be quantitatively predicted via coarse-grained molecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of multiscale polymer modelling to quantitatively predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation, however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study, we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five input parameters, the DNA contour length, persistence length, optical factor, solvent quality, and relaxation time, all of which have been well characterized in prior literature. The method is sufficiently general to apply to a wide range of biopolymers beyond DNA, and our findings could help guide the search for new pharmaceutical drug targets via flow LD.</description>

      <title>Closure to the PRISM equation derived from nonlinear response theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear response theory is employed to derive a closure to the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) equation. The closure applies to a liquid of neutral polymers at melt densities. It can be considered a molecular generalization of the mean spherical approximation (MSA) closure of Lebowitz and Percus to the atomic Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation, and is similar in some aspects to the reference "molecular" MSA (R-MMSA) closure of Schweizer and Yethiraj to PRISM. For a model binary blend of freely-jointed chains, the new closure predicts an unmixing critical temperature, Tc, via the susceptibility route that scales linearly with molecular weight, N, in agreement with Flory theory. Predictions for Tc of the new closure differ greatest from those of the R-MMSA at intermediate N, the latter being about 40% higher than the former there, but at large N both theories give about the same values. For an isotopic blend of polyethylene, the new and R-MMSA closures predict a Tc about 25% higher than the experimental value, which is only moderately less accurate than the prediction of atomic OZ-MSA theory for Tc of methane. In this way, the derivation and its consequences help to identify the ingredients in a theory needed to model properly the equilibrium properties of a polymeric liquid at both short and long lengthscales.</description>

      <title>Specific yet transient bonds between anisotropic colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly of colloidal particles is a promising avenue to control the shape and dynamics of larger aggregates. However, achieving the necessary fine control over the dynamics and specificity of the bonds between such particles remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate such control in bonds mediated by depletion interactions between anisotropic colloids that we 3D-print in the shape of half disks with sub-micron resolution. When brought together by diffusion, the particles interact in different configurations but the interaction through the flat faces is by far the longest-lasting. All bonds are flexible and transient, and we demonstrate control over their life time through the depletant concentration in quantitative agreement with a simple physical model. This basic design could be extended to manufacture particles with multiple binding sites to engineer directional assembly with multiple particles.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a number of realizations of long-range interacting systems, including ultra-cold atomic and molecular gases, we study a neutral plasma with power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulombic. We find that beyond a crossover length, such interactions are universally screened down to a standard Coulomb form in all spatial dimensions. This implies, counter-intuitively, that in two dimensions and below, such a "super-Coulombic" gas is asymptotically Coulombically confining at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the plasma undergoes a deconfining transition that in two dimensions is the same Kosterlitz-Thouless transition that occurs in a conventional Coulomb gas, but at an elevated temperature that we calculate. We also predict that in contrast, above two dimensions, even when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, the super-Coulomb to Coulomb crossover is followed at longer length scales by an unconventional "Debye-Huckel" screening, which leads to faster-than-Coulombic, power-law decay of the screened potential, in contrast to the usual exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Furthermore, we show that power-law potentials, that fall off more rapidly than Coulomb, are screened down to a shorter-ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form. We expect these prediction to be testable in simulations, and hope they will inspire experimental studies in various platforms.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport</title>

Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for cellular function, presenting a canonical example of rapid molecular sorting inside cells. It consists of a coordinated interplay between import/export of molecules in/out the cell nucleus. Here, we investigate the role of spatio-temporal dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation. We develop a biophysical model that captures the main features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular, its regulation through the Ran cycle. Our model yields steady-state profiles for the molecular components of the Ran cycle, their relaxation times, as well as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic molecule ratio. We show that these quantities are affected by their spatial dynamics and heterogeneity within the nucleus. Specifically, we find that the spatial nonuniformity of Ran Guanine Exchange Factor (RanGEF) - particularly its proximity to the nuclear envelope - increases the Ran content in the nucleus. We further show that RanGEF's accumulation near the nuclear envelope results from its intrinsic dynamics as a nuclear cargo, transported by the Ran cycle itself. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of molecular spatial dynamics in cellular processes, and proposes new avenues for theoretical and experimental inquiries into the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</description>

      <title>Condensate Formation in a Chiral Lattice Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of condensates in a binary lattice gas in the presence of chiral interactions. These interactions differ between a given microscopic configuration and its mirror image. We consider a two dimensional lattice gas with nearest-neighbour interactions to which we add interactions involving favoured local structures that are chiral. We focus on favoured local structures that have the shape of the letter L and explore condensate formation through simulations and analytical calculations. At low temperature, this model can exhibit four different phases that are characterised by different periodic tiling patterns, depending on the strength of interactions and the chemical potential. When particle numbers are conserved, some of these phases can coexist. We analyse the structure and surface tension of interfaces between coexisting phases and determine the condensate shapes of minimal free energy. We show that these shapes can be quadrilaterals or octagons of different orientation and symmetry.</description>
