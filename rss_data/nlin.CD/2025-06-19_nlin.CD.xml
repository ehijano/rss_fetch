      <title>On the solvable-unsolvable transition due to noise-induced chaos in digital memcomputing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) have been designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. Since DMMs are fundamentally classical dynamical systems, their ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be efficiently simulated on modern computers. This provides a unique platform to study their performance under various conditions. An aspect that has received little attention so far is how their performance is affected by the numerical errors in the solution of their ODEs and the physical noise they would be naturally subject to if built in hardware. Here, we analyze these two aspects in detail by varying the integration time step (numerical noise) and adding stochastic perturbations (physical noise) into the equations of DMMs. We are particularly interested in understanding how noise induces a chaotic transition that marks the shift from successful problem-solving to failure in these systems. Our study includes an analysis of power spectra and Lyapunov exponents depending on the noise strength. The results reveal a correlation between the instance solvability and the sign of the ensemble averaged mean largest Lyapunov exponent. Interestingly, we find a regime in which DMMs with positive mean largest Lyapunov exponents still exhibit solvability. Furthermore, the power spectra provide additional information about our system by distinguishing between regular behavior (peaks) and chaotic behavior (broadband spectrum). Therefore, power spectra could be utilized to control whether a DMM operates in the optimal dynamical regime. Overall, we find that the qualitative effects of numerical and physical noise are mostly similar, despite their fundamentally different origin.</description>

      <title>Can Laser Resonances Have Irregularities in Oscillations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser resonances play a crucial role in optical and quantum systems because the photons impact the stability and coherence of laser sources. While laser oscillations are typically stable and periodic, the presence of nonlinear effects can introduce irregular dynamical behaviors. This study explores whether laser resonances can exhibit such irregular oscillations by drawing an analogy to the classical and quantum Van der Pol oscillators. The Van der Pol model, known for its self-sustained oscillatory nature, is a simple dissipative nonlinear system. This work investigates how nonlinearity, damping, and quantum fluctuations influence resonance oscillations by examining the transition from classical to quantum regimes. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to assess the stability of fixed points, the emergence of limit cycles, and the impact of increasing nonlinearity for the classical oscillator.</description>

      <title>Dynamic behavior of shear-thickening fluids under harmonic excitation: an experimental investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear-thickening fluids (STFs) become more viscous under shear stress, which makes them useful for many engineering and scientific applications. However, their behavior under normal forces, especially when these forces are applied harmonically, is less understood. Here, we examine the dynamic response of STFs under harmonic excitation. Our experimental setup features an unbalanced rotor attached to a vibrating plate submerged in an STF-filled container. We monitored the rotor's speed, the system's displacement, and the STF force. Data from experiments without STF were used to identify system parameters, and measurements of the STF force revealed the dynamic nature of the STF force. By comparing responses with and without STF, we identified three regions of behavior: in the pre-resonance region, the STF force is negligible; at resonance, it acts as a significant damping force; and in the post-resonance region, it behaves like an on-off force. Overall, the STF effectively reduces resonance amplitudes. These results can inform the design of complex structures incorporating STFs.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Semi-Classical Signatures of Dissipative Chaos in the Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Parameter Inference in Non-linear Dynamical Systems via Recurrence Plots and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inferring control parameters in non-linear dynamical systems is an important task in analysing general dynamical behaviours, particularly in the presence of inherently deterministic chaos. Traditional approaches often rely on system-specific models and involve heavily parametrised formulations, which can limit their general applicability. In this study, we present a methodology that employs recurrence plots as structured representations of non-linear trajectories, which are then used to train convolutional neural networks to infer the values of the control parameter associated with the analysed trajectories. We focus on two representative non-linear systems, namely the logistic map and the standard map, and show that our approach enables accurate estimation of the parameters governing their dynamics. When compared to regression models trained directly on raw time-series data, the use of recurrence plots yields significantly more robust results. Although the methodology does not aim to predict future states explicitly, we argue that accurate parameter inference, when combined with predetermined initial conditions, enables the reconstruction of a system's evolution due to its deterministic nature. These findings highlight the potential of recurrence-based learning frameworks for the automated identification and characterisation of non-linear dynamical behaviours.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Koopmanism and Response Theory: Using Natural Variability to Predict Forced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a cornerstone result in statistical mechanics that can be used to translate the statistics of the free natural variability of a system into information on its forced response to perturbations. By combining this viewpoint on response theory with the key ingredients of Koopmanism, it is possible to deconstruct virtually any response operator into a sum of terms, each associated with a specific mode of natural variability of the system. This dramatically improves the interpretability of the resulting response formulas. We show here on three simple yet mathematically meaningful examples how to use the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm on an individual trajectory of the system to compute with high accuracy correlation functions as well as Green functions associated with acting forcings. This demonstrates the great potential of using Koopman analysis for the key problem of evaluating and testing the sensitivity of a complex system.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>
