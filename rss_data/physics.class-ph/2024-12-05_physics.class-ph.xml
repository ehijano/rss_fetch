      <title>Hamiltonian-based neural networks for systems under nonholonomic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been increasing interest in methodologies that incorporate physics priors into neural network architectures to enhance their modeling capabilities. A family of these methodologies that has gained traction are Hamiltonian neural networks (HNN) and their variations. These architectures explicitly encode Hamiltonian mechanics both in their structure and loss function. Although Hamiltonian systems under nonholonomic constraints are in general not Hamiltonian, it is possible to formulate them in pseudo-Hamiltonian form, equipped with a Lie bracket which is almost Poisson. This opens the possibility of using some principles of HNNs in systems under nonholonomic constraints. The goal of the present work is to develop a modified Hamiltonian neural network architecture capable of modeling Hamiltonian systems under holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. A three-network parallel architecture is proposed to simultaneously learn the Hamiltonian of the system, the constraints, and their associated multipliers. A rolling disk and a ball on a spinning table are considered as canonical examples to assess the performance of the proposed Hamiltonian architecture. The experiments are then repeated with a noisy training set to study modeling performance under more realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Generation of a reflected wave in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous media based on the generalized WKB method. In this approach the field is represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right-travelling WKB solution and the other with the left-travelling WKB solution. It has been shown that the second component is not a left-travelling nonuniform wave. Calculation results showed that the phase distribution of this component has an increasing character, similar to the phase distribution of the right-travelling wave component. Obtained results can be useful during the development of dielectric accelerating waveguides. The obtained results may also indicate the location where a semiclassical particle with energy greater than the barrier height can reflect from a smooth potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>
