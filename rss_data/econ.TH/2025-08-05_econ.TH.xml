      <title>Persuasion in the Long Run: When history matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a long-run persuasion problem where a long-lived Sender repeatedly interacts with a sequence of short-lived Receivers who may adopt a misspecified model for belief updating. The Sender commits to a stationary information structure, but suspicious Receivers compare it to an uninformative alternative and may switch based on the Bayes factor rule. We characterize when the one-shot Bayesian Persuasion-optimal (BP-optimal) structure remains optimal in the long run despite this switching risk. In particular, when Receivers cannot infer the state from the Sender's preferred action, they never switch, and the BP-optimal structure maximizes the Sender's lifetime utility. In contrast, when such inference is possible, full disclosure may outperform BP-optimal. Our findings highlight the strategic challenges of information design when the Receivers' interpretation of signals evolves over time.</description>

      <title>Achieving Irrational Correlated Equilibria without Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the implementation and performance of a decentralized information transmission mechanism in complete information games. We propose a mediator-free mechanism that realizes mediator-free irrational correlated equilibria through a finite sequence of cheap talk. Designed for environments with at least five players, the mechanism leverages encryption techniques to safeguard private information and strategic choices. The core procedure involves three players decomposing and encrypting the equilibrium, while two other players securely randomize and deliver the encrypted recommendations to designated players. Our results demonstrate that all irrational correlated equilibria can be achieved through this mechanism, which is both strategically robust and practically implementable.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft-budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg-style mechanism-design model in which the province commits at initial stage to an ex-ante grant schedule and an ex-post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal-need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single-crossing (or virtual monotonicity with ironing), the problem reduces to one-dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal rule is threshold--linear--cap: no bailouts below a participation cutoff; a linear ramp-up up to a cap; and a hard cap thereafter. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no-bailout regime, and an explicit discount-factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. The closed-form characterisation provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>

      <title>Criminal Property Rights Suppress Violence in Urban Drug Markets: Theory and Evidence from Merseyside, U.K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide empirical evidence on organized criminal groups' (OCGs) behavior across the Liverpool area in the U.K. (Merseyside). We find that violent crimes concerning OCGs concentrate in the areas yielding the highest revenue, while OGCs primarily control areas yielding middle or low revenue. We explain and generalize these empirical observations with a theoretical model examining how OCGs strategically select which area to exploit based on expected revenue and the presence of other OCGs. We prove our results for three OCGs analytically and extend them to larger numbers of OCGs through numerical simulations. Both approaches suggest that, when the frequency of OCG activity is sufficiently high, each OCG controls one area, while the violence between OCGs remains low across all areas. When the frequency of OCG activity reduces, violent collisions between OCGs occur in the areas yielding the highest revenue, while some OCGs retain control over the medium-revenue areas. Our results suggest important policy recommendations. Firstly, if interventions are only violence-driven, they might miss critical underlying factors. Secondly, police operations might have unintended negative externalities in other areas of a city when they target criminal property rights, like increased violence in the areas yielding the highest revenue.</description>

      <title>Most likely retail agglomeration patterns: Potential maximization and stochastic stability of spatial equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model of retail agglomeration where consumers are more likely to visit zones with a higher concentration of shops. This agglomerative effect makes zones with many retailers more attractive. The spatial distribution of retailers in equilibrium is endogenously determined in response to the spatial pattern of shopping demand. In such a setting, multiple locally stable equilibria may arise, and the outcome can depend on the initial distribution of shops. To address this issue, we apply an approach from evolutionary game theory, selecting the equilibrium that maximizes a potential function representing the incentives of retailers. We demonstrate the method in a two-dimensional spatial setting. Compared to local stability based on gradual, myopic adjustments, this global maximization leads to a unique and more robust prediction. As expected, the number of retail clusters decreases either when shopping costs for immobile consumers fall or when the attractiveness of larger retail concentrations increases.</description>

      <title>Comparisons of Experiments in Moral Hazard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use a novel geometric approach to compare information in moral hazard problems. I study three nested geometric orders on information, namely the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope orders. The orders are defined by the inclusion of the column space, the conic span, and the zonotope of the matrices representing the experiments. For each order, I establish four equivalent characterizations, (i) inclusion of polyhedral sets of feasible state dependent utilities, (ii) matrix factorization, (iii) posterior belief distributions, and (iv) classes of moral hazard problems. The column space order characterizes the comparison of feasibility in all moral hazard problems. The conic span order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems with a risk neutral agent and limited liability. The zonotope order characterizes the comparison of costs in all moral hazard problems when the agent can have any utility exhibiting risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Digital Goods Monopoly: A Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13137v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic durable-goods monopoly model of differentiated digital goods. We establish a folk theorem: when both parties are sufficiently patient, any seller payoff ranging from the lowest buyer valuation up to approximately the static commitment monopoly payoff can be sustained in equilibrium. This result emerges from two fundamental characteristics unique to digital goods: free disposability on the buyer side and zero marginal cost on the seller side. Our analysis provides economic intuition consistent with empirical evidence documenting substantially higher markups in digital-intensive industries compared to traditional manufacturing sectors.</description>

      <title>Divide or Confer: Aggregating Information without Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine receiver-optimal mechanisms for aggregating information divided across many biased senders. Each sender privately observes an unconditionally independent signal about an unknown state, so no sender can verify another's report. A receiver makes a binary accept/reject decision that determines the players' payoffs via the state. When information is divided across a small population, and bias is low, the receiver-optimal mechanism coincides with the sender-preferred allocation, and can be implemented by letting senders confer privately before reporting. However, for larger populations, the receiver can benefit from the informational divide. We introduce a novel incentive-compatibility-in-the-large approach to solve the high-dimensional mechanism design problem for the large-population limit. Using this, we show that optimal mechanisms converge to one that depends only on the accept payoff and punishes excessive consensus in the direction of the common bias. These surplus burning punishments lead to payoffs that are bounded away from the first-best.</description>
