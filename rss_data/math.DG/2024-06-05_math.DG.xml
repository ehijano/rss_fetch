      <title>Bounding Shortest Closed Geodesics with Diameter on compact 2-dimensional Orbifolds Homeomorphic to $S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Length bounded sweepouts give a way to bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a closed manifold. In this paper, we generalized to the case of compact 2-dimensional orbifolds homeomorphic to $S^2$ as well as compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with finite orbifold fundamental groups. We proved an inequality for the length of the shortest closed orbifold geodesic in terms of the diameter.</description>

      <title>3-circle Theorem for Willmore surface I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the blow-up of Willmore surfaces. By using the 3-circle theorem, we prove a decay estimate of the second fundamental form along the neck region. This estimate provides a new perspective and streamlined proofs to a few key results in this field, such as the energy identity(quantization), removable singularities and gap theorem.</description>

      <title>Fourier integral operators on Hardy spaces with Hormander class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider a Fourier integral operator defined by
  \begin{align*}
  T_{\phi,a}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}e^{i\phi(x,\xi)}a(x,\xi)\widehat{f}(\xi)d\xi,
  \end{align*}
where $a$ is the amplitude, and $\phi$ is the phase.
  Let $0\leq\rho\leq 1,n\geq 2$ or $0\leq\rho&lt;1,n=1$ and
  $$m_p=\frac{\rho-n}{p}+(n-1)\min\{\frac 12,\rho\}.$$
  If $a$ belongs to the forbidden H\"{o}rmander class $S^{m_p}_{\rho,1}$ and $\phi\in \Phi^{2}$ satisfies the strong non-degeneracy condition, then for any $\frac {n}{n+1}&lt;p\leq 1$, we can show that the Fourier integral operator $T_{\phi,a}$ is bounded from the local Hardy space $h^p$ to $L^p$.
  Furthermore, if $a$ has compact support in variable $x$, then we can extend this result to $0&lt;p\leq 1$. As $S^{m_p}_{\rho,\delta}\subset S^{m_p}_{\rho,1}$ for any $0\leq \delta\leq 1$, our result supplements and improves upon recent theorems proved by Staubach and his collaborators for $a\in S^{m}_{\rho,\delta}$ when $\delta$ is close to 1.
  As an important special case, when $n\geq 2$, we show that $T_{\phi,a}$ is bounded from $H^1$ to $L^1$ if $a\in S^{(1-n)/2}_{1,1}$ which is a generalization of the well-known Seeger-Sogge-Stein theorem for $a\in S^{(1-n)/2}_{1,0}$. This result is false when $n=1$ and $a\in S^{0}_{1,1}$.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities for quasi-Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some geometric inequalities for quasi-Einstein manifolds. We use the generalized Reilly's formulas by Qiu-Xia and Li-Xia to establish new boundary estimates and an isoperimetric type inequality for compact quasi-Einstein manifolds with boundary. Boundary estimates in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator and the Hawking mass are also established. In particular, we present a Heintze-Karcher type inequality for a compact domain on a quasi-Einstein manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the index and nullity for minimal submanifolds of some complex Einstein spaces. We investigate the stability of these minimal submanifolds and suggest a criterion for instability for some cases. We also compute some higher eigenvalues for the Laplacian of the Berger spheres and provide with an algorithm.</description>

      <title>A new conformal quasi-local energy in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new conserved quasi-local energies in general relativity using the formalism developed by \cite{CWY}. In particular, we use the optimal isometric embedding defined in \cite{yau,yau1} to transplant the conformal Killing fields of the Minkowski space back to the $ 2-$ surface of interest in the physical spacetime. For an asymptotically flat spacetime of order $1$, we show that these energies are always finite. Their limit as the total energies of an isolated system is evaluated and a conservation law under Einsteinian evolution is deduced.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

      <title>The SYZ mirror symmetry conjecture for del Pezzo surfaces and rational elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.05416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror symmetry conjecture for non-compact Calabi-Yau surfaces arising from, on the one hand, pairs $(\check{Y},\check{D})$ of a del Pezzo surface $\check{Y}$ and $\check{D}$ a smooth anti-canonical divisor and, on the other hand, pairs $(Y,D)$ of a rational elliptic surface $Y$, and $D$ a singular fiber of Kodaira type $I_k$. Three main results are established concerning the latter pairs $(Y,D)$. First, adapting work of Hein \cite{Hein}, we prove the existence of a complete Calabi-Yau metric on $Y\setminus D$ asymptotic to a (generically non-standard) semi-flat metric in every K\"ahler class. Secondly, we prove a uniqueness theorem to the effect that, modulo automorphisms, every K\"ahler class on $Y\setminus D$ admits a unique asymptotically semi-flat Calabi-Yau metric. This result yields a finite dimensional K\"ahler moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics on $Y\setminus D$. Further, this result answers, in this setting, questions of Tian-Yau and Yau. Thirdly, building on the authors' previous work, we prove that $Y\setminus D$ equipped with an asymptotically semi-flat Calabi-Yau metric $\omega_{CY}$ admits a special Lagrangian fibration whenever the de Rham cohomology class of $\omega_{CY}$ is not topologically obstructed. Combining these results we define a mirror map from the moduli space of del Pezzo pairs $(\check{Y}, \check{D})$ to the complexified K\"ahler moduli of $(Y,D)$ and prove that the special Lagrangian fibration on $(Y,D)$ is $T$-dual to the special Lagrangian fibration on $(\check{Y}, \check{D})$ previously constructed by the authors. We give some applications of these results, including to the study of automorphisms of del Pezzo surfaces fixing an anti-canonical divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a toric K\"ahler-Einstein Fano manifold. We show that any toric shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on certain toric blowups of $\mathbb{C}\times D$ satisfies a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We then set up an Aubin continuity path to solve this equation and show that it has a solution at the initial value of the path parameter. This we do by implementing another continuity method.</description>

      <title>A method for determining Cartan geometries from the local behavior of automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the purpose of determining global properties of Cartan geometries from local information about automorphisms, we introduce a construction for a Cartan geometry that captures the local behavior of a given automorphism near a distinguished element. The result of this construction, which we call the sprawl generated by the automorphism from the distinguished element, is uniquely characterized by a kind of "universal property" that allows us to compare Cartan geometries admitting automorphisms with equivalent local behavior. As example applications, we prove that the only affine structure on a connected manifold admitting an affine transformation with scaling isotropy is the standard one on affine space, and describe how to construct non-flat real projective structures admitting nontrivial automorphisms with higher-order fixed points.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M^{n}, g)$ be a closed connected Einstein space, $n=dim M ,$ and $\kappa_{0} $ be the lower bound of the sectional curvature. In this paper, we prove Udo Simon's conjecture: on closed Einstein spaces, $n\geq 3,$ there is no eigenvalue $\lambda$ such that $$n\kappa_{0} &lt; \lambda &lt; 2(n + 1)\kappa_{0},$$ and both bounds are the best possible. Furthermore, we develop Simon's conjecture to the next gap of eigenvalue $\lambda:$ on closed Einstein spaces, there is no $\lambda$ such that $$
  2(n + 1)\kappa_{0}&lt; \lambda &lt; 2(n+2)\kappa_{0}, $$ and both bounds are the best possible.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We show that there are extremely rich geometric structures attached to certain unstable 3-forms arising naturally from degeneration of Calabi-Yau structures, which in turn provides us a new perspective towards the SYZ conjecture. We give concrete examples and demonstrate that the limiting behavior of the Type IIA flow can be used to detect canonical geometric structures on symplectic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 3-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with asymptotically nonnegative Ricci curvature and a uniformly positive scalar curvature lower bound. Our main result is that, if this manifold has $k$ ends and finite first Betti number, then it has at most linear volume growth, and furthermore, if the negative part of Ricci curvature decays sufficiently fast at infinity, then we have an optimal asymptotic volume ratio $\limsup_{r\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\mathrm{Vol}(B(p, r))}{r}\leq4k\pi$. In particular, our results apply to 3-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and a uniformly positive scalar curvature lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a self-contained exposition of the geometry of symmetric positive-definite real $n\times n$ matrices $\operatorname{SPD}(n)$, including necessary and sufficent conditions for a submanifold $\mathcal{N} \subset\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ to be totally geodesic for the affine-invariant Riemannian metric. A non-linear projection $x\mapsto \pi(x)$ on a totally geodesic submanifold is defined. This projection has the minimizing property with respect to the Riemannian metric: it maps an arbitrary point $x \in\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ to the unique closest element $\pi(x)$ in the totally geodesic submanifold for the distance defined by the affine-invariant Riemannian metric. Decompositions of the space $\operatorname{SPD}(n)$ follow, as well as variants of the polar decomposition of non-singular matrices known as Mostow's decompositions. Applications to decompositions of covariant matrices are mentioned.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every nodal domain of an eigenfunction of the Laplacian of eigenvalue $\lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifold contains a ball of radius $c\lambda^{-1/2}(\log\lambda)^{-(d-2)/2}$. This ball is centered at a point at which the eigenfunction attains its maximum in absolute value within the nodal domain.</description>

      <title>On Selecting Distance Metrics in $n$-Dimensional Normed Vector Spaces of Cells: A Novel Criterion and Similarity Measure Towards Efficient and Accurate Omics Analysis</title>

Abstract: Single-cell omics enable the profiles of cells, which contain large numbers of biological features, to be quantified. Cluster analysis, a dimensionality reduction process, is used to reduce the dimensions of the data to make it computationally tractable. In these analyses, cells are represented as vectors in $n$-Dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a certain cell feature. The distance between cells is used as a surrogate measure of similarity, providing insight into the cell's state, function, and genetic mechanisms. However, as cell profiles are clustered in 3D or higher-dimensional space, it remains unknown which distance metric provides the most accurate spatiotemporal representation of similarity, limiting the interpretability of the data. I propose and prove a generalized proposition and set of corollaries that serve as a criterion to determine which of the standard distance measures is most accurate for conveying cell profile heterogeneity. Each distance method is evaluated via statistical, geometric, and topological proofs, which are formalized into a set of criteria. In this paper, I present the putative, first-ever method to elect the most accurate and precise distance metrics with any profiling modality, which are determined to be the Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity metrics, respectively, in general cases. I also identify special cases in which the criterion may select non-standard metrics. Combining the metric properties selected by the criterion, I develop a novel, custom, optimal distance metric that demonstrates superior computational efficiency, peak annotation, motif identification, and footprinting for transcription factor binding sites when compared with leading methods.</description>

      <title>Milnor-Wood inequality for klt varieties of general type and uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the definition of the Toledo invariant for representations of fundamental groups of smooth varieties of general type due to Koziarz and Maubon to the context of singular klt varieties, where the natural fundamental groups to consider are those of smooth loci. Assuming that the rank of the target Lie group is not greater than two, we show that the Toledo invariant satisfies a Milnor-Wood type inequality and we characterize the corresponding maximal representations.</description>

      <title>Abstract Group Automorphisms of Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Groups and Partial Automatic Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any abstract (not necessarily continuous) group automorphism of a simple, compact Lie group must be continuous due to Cartan (1930) and van der Waerden (1933). The purpose of this paper is to study a similar question in nilpotent Lie groups. For many simply connected 2-step nilpotent Lie groups, we show any abstract group automorphism is continuous "up to discontinuity due to the center and field automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}$." Such groups include (1) a generic simply connected 2-step nilpotent Lie group of type $(p,q)$ with $p$ large, (2) all twelve simply connected 2-step nilpotent Lie groups of dimensions 6 or less except for one example, and (3) Iwasawa N-groups of simple Lie groups of rank 1, i.e., "Heisenberg groups". To our knowledge, the exception in (2) is the first nilpotent Lie group whose automorphism group is not of the type described above. In the proof for (3), we use tools from Riemannian geometry, even though the result is purely algebraic. All of the three cases are derived from one key result that gives a sufficient condition for the automorphism group to be of the type described above.</description>
