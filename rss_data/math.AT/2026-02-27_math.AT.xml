      <title>It's All About Covers: Persistent Homology of Cover Refinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational cost of persistent homology is often dominated by the growth of the underlying simplicial filtrations. Many different filtrations exist, each with its own assumptions and trade-offs, but all face some form of this growth which can be exponential in the worst case, as for the Vietoris-Rips. We recast this problem at the level of covers, developing a framework in which filtrations and persistence modules can be constructed, analyzed, and compared through simple relations between covers rather than at the level of simplicial complexes. The guarantees propagate through any functor that preserves the contiguity of refinement maps, we give the example of two such functors: the Nerve and the Co-Nerve. Working at this level is drastically simpler, with stronger, more general consequences. We explore this perspective and show how it can be used to construct a robust approximation of the Vietoris-Rips filtration that is orders of magnitude smaller, while maintaining a log 3-interleaving unconditionally for any metric space. The resulting filtration restores near-linear scaling in the number of data points and enable us to efficiently capture homology at high degrees.</description>

      <title>Learning Tangent Bundles and Characteristic Classes with Autoencoder Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that connects multi-chart autoencoders in manifold learning with the classical theory of vector bundles and characteristic classes. Rather than viewing autoencoders as producing a single global Euclidean embedding, we treat a collection of locally trained encoder-decoder pairs as a learned atlas on a manifold. We show that any reconstruction-consistent autoencoder atlas canonically defines transition maps satisfying the cocycle condition, and that linearising these transition maps yields a vector bundle coinciding with the tangent bundle when the latent dimension matches the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This construction provides direct access to differential-topological invariants of the data. In particular, we show that the first Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed from the signs of the Jacobians of learned transition maps, yielding an algorithmic criterion for detecting orientability. We also show that non-trivial characteristic classes provide obstructions to single-chart representations, and that the minimum number of autoencoder charts is determined by the good cover structure of the manifold. Finally, we apply our methodology to low-dimensional orientable and non-orientable manifolds, as well as to a non-orientable high-dimensional image dataset.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Persistent Topological Features and Minimum Homological Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular method for computing topological features of (metric) data. Standard approaches based on the \v{C}ech or Rips filtration are stable under small perturbations of the data, but highly sensitive to outliers. This lack of robustness has been frequently addressed in the literature. In this paper, we take a novel perspective by asking the following question: When can we guarantee that an observed persistent feature (a bar) is inherent to the underlying data in the presence of a limited number of unknown, arbitrary outliers. We formalize this question by introducing the notion of \emph{adversarial robustness}, and study the problem of deciding whether a given bar in the barcode of a filtered simplicial complex is adversarially robust. We show that this problem is essentially equivalent to a homological variant of the minimum cut problem in simplicial complexes, which we believe to be of independent interest. As our main technical contribution, we provide the first computational complexity results for this problem, consisting of an efficient algorithm in $0$-dimensional homology, NP-hardness for the general problem, and an efficient algorithm for codimension-$1$ in $n$-dimensional complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also analyze its natural linear programming relaxation, whose dual defines a homological analog of the max-flow problem in graphs. We show that a max-flow/min-cut theorem does not hold in our setting, implying that the LP relaxation is not tight in general. Finally, in the special case of the Rips filtration, we provide a global heuristic based on the Hausdorff distance that guarantees adversarial robustness of sufficiently long bars. This connects adversarial robustness to standard stability theorems in persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e dualization and Massey products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rational homotopy theoretic and geometric properties of a construction which extends any cohomologically connected, finite type cdga to one satisfying cohomological Poincar\'e duality. Using this construction we show that non-trivial quadruple Massey products can pull back trivially under non-zero degree maps of Poincar\'e duality spaces, unlike the case of triple Massey products as studied by Taylor. We also show that a non-zero degree map between formal rational Poincar\'e duality spaces need not be formal. Our consideration of Massey products naturally ties in with cyclic $A_\infty$-algebras modelling Poincar\'e duality spaces.</description>

      <title>A recognition principle for iterated suspensions as coalgebras over the little cubes operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main result is a recognition principle for iterated suspensions as coalgebras over the little disks operads. Given a topological operad, we construct a comonad in pointed topological spaces endowed with the wedge product. We then prove an approximation theorem that shows that the comonad associated to the little $n$-cubes operad is weakly equivalent to the comonad $\Sigma^n \Omega^n$ arising from the suspension-loop space adjunction. Finally, our recognition theorem states that every little $n$-cubes coalgebra is homotopy equivalent to an $n$-fold suspension. These results are the Eckmann--Hilton dual of May's foundational results on iterated loop spaces.</description>

      <title>New infinite families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify seven new $192$-periodic infinite families of elements in the $2$-primary stable homotopy groups of spheres. Although their Hurewicz image is trivial for topological modular forms, they remain nontrivial after $\mathrm{T}(2)$- as well as $\mathrm{K}(2)$-localization. We also obtain new information about $2$-torsion and $2$-divisibility of some of the previously known $192$-periodic infinite families in the stable stems.</description>

      <title>Hyperelliptic four-manifolds defined by vector-colorings of simple polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toric topology assigns to each simple convex $n$-polytope $P$ with $m$ facets an $n$-dimensional real moment angle manifold $\mathbb RZ_P$ with a canonical action of $\mathbb Z_2^m=(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^m$. We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on $\mathbb RZ_P$. The orbit space $N(P,H)=\mathbb RZ_P/H$ has an action of $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$. For general $n$ we introduce the notion of a Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex in the boundary of an $n$-polytope $P$ generalizing the notions of a Hamiltonian cycle ($k=2$), Hamiltonian theta-subgraph ($k=3$) and Hamiltonian $K_4$-subgraph ($k=4)$ in the $1$-skeleton of a $3$-polytope. Each $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset \partial P$ corresponds to a subgroup $H_C\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $N(P,H_C)\simeq S^n$. We prove that in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. Any subgroup $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ defines a complex $C(P,H)\subset \partial P$. We prove that each Hamiltonian $C(n,k)$-subcomplex $C\subset C(P,H)$ inducing $H$ corresponds to a hyperelliptic involution $\tau_C\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ on the manifold $N(P,H)$ (that is, an involution with the orbit space homeomorphic to $S^n$) and in dimensions $n\leqslant 4$ this correspondence is a bijection. We prove that for the geometries $\mathbb X= \mathbb S^4$, $\mathbb S^3\times\mathbb R$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb S^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb R^2$, $\mathbb S^2\times \mathbb L^2$, and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb L^2$ there exists a compact right-angled $4$-polytope $P$ with a free action of $H$ such that the geometric manifold $N(P,H)$ has a hyperelliptic involution in $\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, and for $\mathbb X=\mathbb R^4$, $\mathbb L^4$, $\mathbb L^3\times \mathbb R$ and $\mathbb L^2\times \mathbb R^2$ there are no such polytopes.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of the Cohomology Algebra of the Even Orthogonal Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M_{n,k}$ denote the even orthogonal Grassmanian, $SO(2n) / (U(k) \times SO(2n-2k) )$. We study endomorphisms of the rational cohomology algebra of $M_{n,k}$. We prove that an endomorphism of the rational cohomology algebra of $M_{n,k}$, which maps all the Chern classes of the canonical $k$-plane bundle over $M_{n,k}$ to zero, or maps all the Pontrjagin classes of the canonical, real, oriented $(2n-2k)$-plane bundle over $M_{n,k}$ to zero, is the zero endomorphism. Additionally, we prove that if an endomorphism of the rational cohomology algebra of $M_{n,k}$ vanishes on $H^{2}(M_{n,k}; \mathbb{Q})$, and admits a splitting, then the splitting equals zero.</description>
