      <title>Background Field Effects on Quasi-Real Photon Emission and Lepton-Pair Production at EIC and EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how background electromagnetic fields modify quasi-real photon emission at the EIC and EicC through an effective coupling correction, thereby altering the photon flux spectrum. The resulting change in lepton-pair production via photon-photon fusion, where one photon arises from the electron and the other from the nuclear Coulomb field-serves as a clean QED probe of such background effects. In our formulation, the correction originates from a non-perturbative modification of the photon propagator induced by the background field. Because this process shares the same initial-state photon dynamics as photon-gluon fusion, any background-induced alteration of the photon propagator directly impacts the extraction of small-$x$ gluon distributions. Numerical estimates at realistic collider energies indicate that these corrections should be non-negligible in certain kinematic regions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative aspects of the electroweak phase transition with a complex singlet and implications for gravitational wave predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of strong first-order electroweak phase transitions within the extension of the Standard Model by a complex scalar singlet (cxSM). Focusing on the impact of renormalization scale and gauge dependence, we systematically compare commonly used perturbative frameworks for predicting thermodynamic observables that characterize the phase transition and the associated gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum. These include both the four-dimensional ($4D$) formalism and the dimensionally reduced three-dimensional effective field theory ($3D$ EFT) approach in different renormalization schemes. Within the $3D$ EFT, we compute the effective potential up to two-loop order in a general $R_\xi$ gauge, and demonstrate that applying the $\hbar$-expansion yields gauge-independent results in excellent agreement with those obtained from a direct minimization of the loop-corrected potential. In contrast, large discrepancies between the two methods persist in the $4D$ approaches. We find that, across most of the parameter space, the $3D$ EFT approach provides the most robust predictions for phase-transition parameters and GW spectra, reducing theoretical uncertainties in the GW peak amplitude by more than an order of magnitude compared to the $4D$ calculations. We point out, however, that the $3D$ EFT approach is subject to an additional theory uncertainty from truncating the EFT at finite operator dimension and show that higher-dimensional operators within the $3D$ EFT approach can substantially modify the predicted transition strength and GW signals. This indicates a potential breakdown of the high-temperature expansion precisely in the region with the lowest transition temperatures, where the strongest GW signals are expected and the detection prospects with LISA are most promising.</description>

      <title>How to pick the best anomaly detector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection has the potential to discover new physics in unexplored regions of the data. However, choosing the best anomaly detector for a given data set in a model-agnostic way is an important challenge which has hitherto largely been neglected. In this paper, we introduce the data-driven ARGOS metric, which has a sound theoretical foundation and is empirically shown to robustly select the most sensitive anomaly detection model given the data. Focusing on weakly-supervised, classifier-based anomaly detection methods, we show that the ARGOS metric outperforms other model selection metrics previously used in the literature, in particular the binary cross-entropy loss. We explore several realistic applications, including hyperparameter tuning as well as architecture and feature selection, and in all cases we demonstrate that ARGOS is robust to the noisy conditions of anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation in photon-induced electron-muon pairs at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the outstanding potential of the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) to discover charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) via the ultra-peripheral process $\gamma\gamma \to e^\pm\mu^\mp$. Using a gauge-invariant Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework -consistent with the most stringent bounds from radiative decays- we perform a full Monte Carlo analysis with multivariate techniques. Our results show that a $5\sigma$ discovery is achievable with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm int} \gtrsim 2700$ fb$^{-1}$ for favorable benchmark scenarios. This study establishes photon-fusion at the HL-LHC as a powerful probe of cLFV, strongly motivating dedicated searches by the experimental collaborations.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency radio telescopes sensitivity to light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based radio telescopes are routinely used to search for light dark matter (DM) candidates such as axion-like particles or dark photons. These instruments face however inherent limitations to push the searches to masses below $10^{-7}$ eV, due to the effect of the Earth's ionosphere. The extant and planned space- or Moon-based radio telescopes motivate this study: We systematically investigate their sensitivity to resonant conversion of light DM into radio signals from three solar system targets: the Sun, the Earth, and Jupiter. The perspectives are especially encouraging for dark photon searches using the Sun as a target, and for axion-like particles conversion in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Probing Axion via M\"ossbauer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using the ultra-narrow 88 keV M\"ossbauer transition in $^{109}$Ag to search for QCD axion dark matter. The sub-eV axion field oscillates coherently, inducing a time-varying effective $\bar{\theta}_{\rm QCD}$ angle. This, in turn, modulates the nuclear binding energy. From existing linewidth measurements, we derive constraints on the $f_a^{-1}$-$m_a$ plane that already surpass other laboratory bounds. We further detail an experimental setup to directly probe this time-dependent signature via precision M\"ossbauer spectroscopy in the gravitational potential. This Letter demonstrates that this approach can significantly extend search capability and probe a vast, unexplored region of axion parameter space. Particularly, this setup can probe axion masses beyond the reach of existing experiments, such as atomic-clock measurements, offering a powerful new way for exploring higher-mass axion dark matter. The sensitivity has the potential to be further improved with advancing experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>511 keV Gamma Ray Echo from Particle Decays in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of a hot and dense core in a core-collapse supernova (SN) can produce massive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles. These particles can decay in the stellar envelope, generating positrons either directly or through secondary processes involving neutrinos or photons. We show for the first time that such positrons regardless of their production channel, can thermalize and annihilate at rest with ambient electrons in the outer SN envelope, producing a characteristic echo of 511 keV gamma rays. For axion-like particles (ALPs), we derive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling ($G_{a \gamma}$) using Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations of SN 1987A. We also evaluate the sensitivity of upcoming MeV gap gamma-ray telescopes in the 511 keV range, such as COSI and AMEGO, for future Galactic SNe, which can improve existing constraints or enable ALP discovery. The echo signal is a generic prediction for any particle species that efficiently produces positrons near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Improved cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions based on state-of-the-art computations of the thermal axion abundance. By combining Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2, we derive improved limits on both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion couplings. Incorporating finite axion mass effects substantially strengthens the bounds for axion masses above 0.1 eV compared to those inferred from the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint alone. The bounds on the LFC axion-tau coupling and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are improved by several orders of magnitude and the lower bound on the axion decay constant may exceed $10^6$ and $10^8$ GeV, respectively, for axion masses above 1 eV. Our cosmological constraints on LFC axion couplings to muons and taus and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are stronger than all other constraints for masses above 0.3 eV. In particular, they are stronger than recent collider constraints from Belle-II on $\tau \rightarrow la$ decays, where $l=e$ or $\mu$. The collider constraints on $\mu \rightarrow ea$ decays are weaker than the cosmological constraints for axion masses above 100 eV. Our results are relevant for both the QCD axion and axion-like particles (ALPs).</description>

      <title>Structure of non-global logarithms with Cambridge/Aachen clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the structure of both Abelian and non-Abelian non-global logarithms up to four loops for $e^+ e^-$ processes in perturbative QCD, where final-state jets are defined using the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) clustering algorithm. The calculations are performed within the soft (eikonal) approximation using strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons. The resulting expressions include full colour and complete jet-radius dependence. Compared to the anti-$k_t$ and $k_t$ clustering algorithms, the C/A distribution minimises the impact of these non-global logarithms, making it the preferred choice among the three algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$\sigma$ of the current central values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.</description>

      <title>Large-Width New Physics at Colliders: A Gauge-Invariant Resummation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad resonances challenge the standard Monte-Carlo treatment of unstable particles, which introduces a Breit-Wigner width into leading-order matrix elements and can generate unphysical gauge artifacts. We develop a gauge-consistent framework that combines a Dyson-resummed propagator with Slavnov-Taylor-identity-implied resummed vertices, enabling a consistent implementation in MadGraph5. In the Type-I seesaw model, heavy Majorana neutrinos naturally satisfy $\Gamma \sim m$, leading to strong departures from the Breit-Wigner lineshape, distorted angular correlations, and significant modifications to both $s$- and $t$-channel dynamics. Comparing with the normal and complex-mass schemes, we find that standard treatments can substantially misestimate cross sections and kinematic distributions in the large-width regime. Our results show that existing collider limits on heavy neutrinos-and, more generally, on any broad resonance-should be revisited within a fully resummed framework, opening new opportunities for both experimental searches and theoretical model building.</description>

      <title>Divergence in tracing the flavors of astrophysical neutrinos: can JUNO help IceCube?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</description>

      <title>Towards the full NLO electro-weak corrections to Higgs boson pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the Higgs boson self-interaction is one of the main goals for the high luminosity phase of the LHC. A promising channel to this aim is the simultaneous production of two Higgs bosons from gluon fusion. For the interpretation of the data, precise theoretical predictions, also for differential cross sections, are needed. Following current projections this requires electroweak corrections at next-to-leading order. We present the contributions of top-Yukawa and Higgs self-interaction-type, as well as the first steps towards inclusion of the complete NLO electroweak corrections.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay in Light of JUNO First Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first results from the JUNO reactor neutrino oscillation experiment improve our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing parameters, especially the solar angle $\theta_s \equiv \theta_{12}$ and the solar mass squared difference $\Delta m^2_s \equiv \Delta m^2_{21}$. We discuss the implications of these results on neutrinoless double beta decay by itself and in combination with the global fit of neutrino oscillation experiments, the JUNO first data, and cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass sum. For the effective mass $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$, the uncertainties in its lower limits for both mass orderings and upper limits for the normal ordering are largely reduced. Since the cosmological CMB and DESI BAO data put a stringent constraint on the neutrino mass scale, we also show how the probability distribution of both the real and imaginary parts of the effective mass $\langle m_{ee} \rangle$ on the complex plane is affected. Especially, the funnel region with $|\langle m_{ee} \rangle| \lesssim 1$\,meV receives larger chance to happen. Correspondingly, the chance of determining the two Majorana CP phases simultaneously in this region also increases with reduced uncertainty.</description>

      <title>CP Prediction from Residual $\mathbb Z_2^s$ and $\overline{\mathbb Z}_2^s$ Symmetries with JUNO First Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JUNO first data and the recent neutrino global fit results are implemented in the sum rule from the residual $\mathbb Z^s_2$ and $\overline{\mathbb Z}^s_2$ symmetries to make prediction of the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_D$. Without involving model parameters, the probability distribution of $\delta_D$ can be readily obtained from the experimental measurements of the three mixing angles. We then confront the theoretical predictions with the global fit results for the CP phase as well as the T2K and NOvA joint analysis for their CP measurement to give the data preference of the two residual symmetries with Bayes factor for both normal and inverted orderings. We further extend our analysis to a two-dimensional probability distribution to fully explore the correlation between the CP phase $\delta_D$ and the atmospheric angle $\theta_a \equiv \theta_{23}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach to neutrino oscillations in dark matter and its implication in the Juno experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation is a significant physical process worthy of in-depth exploration. In this paper, we investigate the matter effect of massive neutrinos in a scalar-type ultra-light dark matter and calculate the neutrino oscillation probability using the quantum field theory method. The result reveals that the neutrino oscillation probability derived from the quantum field theory approach exhibits no additional time dependence, which marks the most significant distinction from the oscillation result obtained through the quantum mechanics method. Furthermore, we discuss predictions of the Juno experiment regarding neutrino oscillation behavior in scalar-type ultra-light dark matter. This study extends the understanding of the interaction between neutrinos and dark matter, which warrants further exploration.</description>

      <title>Partial-Wave Unitarity Bounds on Higher-Dimensional Operators from 2-to-$N$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for deriving partial-wave unitarity bounds on Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators in effective field theories involving more than four fields, which naturally appear in tree-level 2-to-$N$ scattering processes with $N \geq 3$. Unlike 2-to-2 scattering, 2-to-$N$ scattering with $N \geq 3$ features multiple amplitudes associated with the same total angular momentum. To resolve these degeneracies, we provide a way to construct an orthonormal amplitude basis by parameterizing the phase space manifold of massless particles using spinor-helicity variables, enabling analytical integration over the phase space with arbitrary particle numbers. We provide Mathematica code to analytically evaluate phase space integrals of interference between two local on-shell amplitudes up to four final-state particles, with straightforward generalization to $N$ final-state particles. As practical applications, we demonstrate the use of this tool by deriving unitarity bounds on some dimension-7 and dimension-8 operators in the Standard Model effective field theory involving five and six fields, respectively.</description>

      <title>Probing unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix with reactor antineutrinos at JUNO and TAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters at Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), we investigate the possibility of probing the unitarity violation of lepton flavor mixing matrix solely with reactor antineutrinos. First, we stress that it is necessary to reconsider the production and detection of neutrinos in a self-consistent way, apart from neutrino propagation, when analyzing experimental sensitivities to unitarity violation. Then, concentrating on JUNO and its satellite experiment Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO), we demonstrate how the event rates of inverse beta decays (i.e., $\overline{\nu}^{}_e + p \to e^+ + n$) for observing $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_e$ oscillations, and those of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering (i.e., $\overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^- \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\alpha + e^-$ with $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$) for $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\mu$ and $\overline{\nu}^{}_e \to \overline{\nu}^{}_\tau$ oscillations, depend on the parameters characterizing unitarity violation. Our investigation will be useful for JUNO and TAO to place independent constraints with more data in the near future.</description>

      <title>Assessing (H)EFT theory errors by pitting EoM against Field Redefinitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Truncations of effective field theory expansions are technically necessary but inherently intertwined with the redundancies of general field redefinitions. This can be viewed as a juxtaposition of power-counting and theoretical uncertainties, which seek to estimate neglected higher-dimensional interactions through approaches based on community consensus. One can then understand the invariance of physics under field redefinitions as a data-informed validation of different power-counting schemes, or as a means of assigning theoretical errors in comparison with algebraic, equation of motion-based replacements. Such an approach generalises widely accepted procedures for estimating theoretical uncertainties within the SM to non-renormalisable interactions. We perform a case study for a representative example in Higgs Effective Field theory, focusing on universal Higgs properties tensioned against process-dependent sensitivity expectations.</description>

      <title>Towards the LHCb pentaquark modes in the single-charm sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectrum of $\Lambda_c$ baryon family is investigated within the $DN$-$D^*N$ coupled-channel framework using two phenomenological approaches for the low-energy $D^{(*)} N$ interactions: the heavy quark effective theory and the flavor-symmetry-constrained effective Lagrangian method. It is shown that the LHCb pentaquark states have direct analogs in the $\Lambda_c$ family. Specifically, $\Lambda_c(2765)$, $\Lambda_c(2910)$, and $\Lambda_c(2940)$ mirror the patterns of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)$, respectively. These mirror pentaquark modes offer valuable insights into the quantum numbers of the two heavy $P_{c\bar{c}}$ states, which remain experimentally undetermined. Further exploration of such correlations among exotic hadronic states across different flavor sectors will be crucial for developing a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the modern hadron spectrum.</description>

      <title>Trimaximal Mixing Patterns Meet the First JUNO Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JUNO experiment has recently released its first measurement results based on 59.1 days of data, achieving unprecedented precision in measuring the lepton mixing angle $\theta_{12}$. This significant improvement places stringent constraints on certain neutrino mass models and flavor mixing patterns. In this work, we examine the impact of the latest JUNO results on the two trimaximal (i.e., TM1 and TM2) mixing patterns. They are two well-motivated variants of the tri-bimaximal mixing pattern and predict specific correlations between $\theta_{12}$ and $\theta_{13}$, which lie outside the experimentally allowed $1\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ regions, respectively, after taking into account JUNO's results. Then, attempting to reconcile these TM mixing patterns with the latest experimental data, we further investigate the renormalization group (RG) running effects on them in the both Majorana and Dirac neutrino cases. Our analytical and numerical results show that RG corrections can bring the two TM mixing patterns into excellent agreement with the latest JUNO data if neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate. However, the Majorana case faces severe constraints from neutrinoless double beta decay limits, and particularly, the TM2 mixing pattern with Majorana neutrinos has been essentially ruled out. In the Dirac case, the TM1 mixing pattern is fully consistent with current data including beta decay results, whereas the TM2 pattern is strongly constrained by the KATRIN limit and even could be largely ruled out if the KATRIN experiment reaches its final sensitivity without any discovery. Future high-precision measurements of lepton mixing parameters and absolute neutrino masses in both oscillation and non-oscillation experiments will provide decisive tests of these mixing patterns.</description>

      <title>New features in the Z2xZ2 3HDM two component DM model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints and phenomenology of a three Higgs doublet model (3HDM) with a $\Z2\times\Z2$ symmetry, featuring two inert scalar doublets that give rise to a two-component dark matter (DM) scenario. We analyze the model's vacuum structure, exploring the competition between different symmetry-breaking minima, and subject it to comprehensive theoretical and current experimental constraints. Our analysis reveals previously unexplored regions of parameter space with viable dark matter candidates. Notably, we identify scenarios where both DM particles contribute comparably to the observed relic density, offering distinctive experimental signatures that could guide future searches.</description>

      <title>Fant\^omas: An analysis of parton distributions in a pion with B\'ezier parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore the parametrization dependence of the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) to better quantify the true uncertainty from global QCD analyses. To achieve this, we employ a novel technique that automates the generation of polynomial parametrizations for PDFs using B\'ezier curves. This technique is implemented in a C++ module, named Fant\^omas, which is now included within the xFitter program. As an example, we examine the charged pion PDF. Our analysis reveals that the sea and gluon distributions in the pion are strongly correlated, and PDF solutions featuring a vanishing gluon and a large quark sea are still experimentally allowed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the QCD Parton Model analysis by employing a factorized nuclear structure model that explicitly accounts for both individual nucleons and correlated nucleon pairs. This novel framework establishes a paradigm that directly links the nuclear physics description of matter (in terms of protons and neutrons) to the particle physics schema (in terms of quarks and gluons). Our analysis of high-energy data from lepton Deep-Inelastic Scattering, Drell-Yan, and W/Z production simultaneously extracts the universal effective distribution of quarks and gluons inside correlated nucleon pairs, and their nucleus-specific fractions. The successful extraction of these universal distributions marks a significant advance in our understanding of nuclear structure, as it directly connects nucleon-level and parton-level quantities.</description>

      <title>Further Reduction of the PDF Uncertainty in the High-Mass Drell-Yan Spectrum Utilizing Neutral and Charged Current Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainties in the parametrization of Parton Distribution Functions are a serious limiting systematic uncertainty in Large Hadron Collider searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics. This is especially true for measurements at high scales induced by quark and anti-quark collisions, where Drell-Yan continuum backgrounds are dominant. In Phys. Rev. D99, 054004 (2019) we presented a unique strategy for improving uncertainties using neutral current Drell-Yan backgrounds and here we update that strategy and include charged current Drell-Yan final states in the program and demonstrate significant improvements. Through a judicious selection of measurable kinematical quantities can reduce the assigned systematic PDF uncertainties by significant factors in limit-setting or discovery for neutral and charged, high mass Intermediate Vector Bosons. This approach will be take advantage of the huge statistical precision of future High Luminosity, Large Hadron Collider Standard Model datasets and could also improve uncertainties in the high statistics results from LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Matter Effects on Reactor Antineutrino Oscillations: Constant vs. Fluctuated Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JUNO Collaboration has recently released its first reactor antineutrino oscillation result, achieving unprecedented precision in the measurement of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. We emphasize that the accurate determination and modeling of the terrestrial matter density profile are fundamental for extracting the oscillation parameters and probing the neutrino mass ordering. This paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10\%. A careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss the possibility of tomography of the shallow Earth's crust in future reactor neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Resolving Ratio Redundancy in Chemical Freeze-out Studies with Principal Component Analysis and Bayesian Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--Bayesian framework for extracting chemical freeze-out conditions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that resolves long-standing ambiguities in hadron-ratio--based analyses. By constructing all possible hadron-yield ratios from a chosen set of species and transforming them into an orthogonal PCA basis, the method removes linear redundancies and eliminates the information loss and systematic uncertainties associated with ratio selection. Energy-wise Bayesian calibration of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is then performed directly in this decorrelated space, with a Gaussian Process emulator enabling fast and accurate model evaluations. A detailed Sobol sensitivity analysis, together with the PCA loading structure, identifies the most informative ratio combinations and reveals a transition from chemical-potential--dominated to temperature-controlled freeze-out with increasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The calibrated model reproduces all measured ratios, and the extracted freeze-out parameters are consistent with previous HRG determinations.</description>

      <title>The Penrose Transform and the Kerr-Schild double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.</description>

      <title>Sampling Polynomial Rational Remainders with SP$\mathbb{Q}$R: A new Package for Polynomial Division and Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SP$\mathbb{Q}$R, a new Mathematica package for the division and elimination of variables from polynomial systems. SP$\mathbb{Q}$R works by sampling and reconstructing results over finite fields, in an analogous manner to many state of the art Integration by Parts algorithms for Feynman integrals. This allows SP$\mathbb{Q}$R to effectively overcome expression swell during the construction of Gr\"obner bases, which in many cases is the major bottleneck in such computations. Benchmarks on state of the art Macaulay resultants show that SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can deliver substantial gains over symbolic computer algebra workflows -- reducing both runtime and memory footprint by multiple orders of magnitude. Likewise when applied to study Feynman integrals, we show how SP$\mathbb{Q}$R can be used to find previously unknown Landau singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a detailed account of the algorithm outlined in [1] for Feynman integral reduction and $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equations. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we use a new geometric order relation in the integration-by-parts reduction to obtain a basis of master integrals, whose differential equations are of a Laurent polynomial form in the regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$ and compatible with a filtration. This step works entirely with rational functions. In a second step, we provide a method to $\varepsilon$-factorise the aforementioned Laurent differential equations. The second step may introduce algebraic and transcendental functions. We illustrate the versatility of the algorithm by applying it to different examples with a wide range of complexity.</description>

      <title>Viscous Dark Energy and Mass-Varying Dark Matter in Lyra Manifold: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.</description>

      <title>Detectability of axion-like dark matter for different time-delay interferometry combinations in space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the space-based gravitational wave detections, the axion-like dark matter would alter the polarization state of the laser link between spacecrafts due to the birefringence effect. However, current designs of space-based laser interferometer are insensitive to variations in the polarization angle. Thus, the additional wave plates are employed to enable the response of the axion-induced birefringence effect. We calculate and compare the sensitivities of different space-based detectors, accounting for three time-delay interferometry combinations, including Monitor, Beacon, and Relay. We find that the Monitor and Beacon combinations have better sensitivity in the high-frequency range, and the optimal sensitivity reaches $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-13}\text{GeV}^{-1}$, while the Sagnac combination is superior in the low-frequency range. We also find that ASTROD-GW can cover the detection range of axion-like dark matter mass down to $10^{-20}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>First observation of deuteron-{\Lambda} correlations at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise experimental information on hyperon-nucleon interactions is scarce but of paramount importance to our understanding of the inner structure of compact stars. In this letter, we report the first experimental results of correlation functions between deuterons (d) and {\Lambda} hyperons in Au+Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN} = 3.0 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC. A clear enhancement at small relative momenta has been observed in the correlation function. Through a Bayesian inference analysis, the source size parameters as a function of collision centrality and the spin- dependent strong interaction parameters (scattering length f0 and effective range d0) are extracted using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism. The derived doublet spin state parameters (f0, d0) lead to a novel method to precisely determine {\Lambda} separation energy for the weakly bounded hypertriton ^{3}_{{\Lambda}}H.</description>

      <title>Is There New Physics Beyond 30 TeV in the BOAT?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the GRB 221009A spectrum detected by LHAASO can be used to probe effects of quadratic subluminal Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) through the enhancement of the observed flux at the highest energies. In particular, we argue that excesses in the GRB 221009A data currently classified as non-detections at energies $E \gtrsim 30$ TeV warrant further investigation, as they may indicate a recovery of the intrinsic source spectrum consistent with the LIV-induced suppression of $\gamma\gamma \to e^-e^+$ interactions within the quadratic subluminal scenario. This would increase the accessible parameter space of the energy scale of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing Mellin moments of double parton distributions from calculations on a Euclidean lattice requires taking an integral over a variable that may be regarded as a Ioffe time. The Fourier conjugate of this variable plays the role of a kinematic skewness in the double parton distributions. We discuss the skewness dependence of the relevant hadronic correlation functions. Using several models, we study the impact of this dependence on extracting moments of double parton distributions from existing lattice data.</description>

      <title>Relativistic mean-field model with density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new hadronic EoS with hyperons built within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism with baryon-density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings. Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle. The low-density part of the EoS is described via nuclear statistical equilibrium with modern mass tables (AME20/FRDM12, 8244 nuclei), providing a novel and complete general-purpose EoS for astrophysical simulations.</description>

      <title>From Qubits to Couplings: A Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Framework for LHC Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning (HyQML) framework to improve the sensitivity of double Higgs boson searches in the $HH \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ final state at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV. The proposed model combines parameterized quantum circuits with a classical neural network meta-model, enabling event-level features to be embedded in a quantum feature space while maintaining the optimization stability of classical learning. The hybrid model outperforms both a state-of-the-art XGBoost model and a purely quantum implementation by a factor of two, achieving an expected 95% CL upper limit on the non-resonant double Higgs boson production cross-section of $1.9\times\sigma_{\text{SM}}$ and $2.1\times\sigma_{\text{SM}}$ under background normalization uncertainties of 10% and 50%, respectively. In addition, expected constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling $\kappa_{\lambda}$ and quartic vector-boson-Higgs coupling $\kappa_{2V}$ are found to be improved compared to the classical and purely quantum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational wave spectra from strongly supercooled first-order phase transitions, explicitly incorporating the evolution of the background metric across the transition from thermal inflation to radiation domination. We find that the spectral shape remains largely unchanged apart from a causality-induced super-horizon tail. However, in contrast to standard expectations, for slow transitions we show that the peak amplitude and frequency exhibit a weaker dependence on the transition rate $\beta$ than the usual scaling of $\propto \beta^{-2}$ and $\propto\beta$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Effects of short-range correlations at high densities on neutron stars with and without DM content: role of the repulsive self-interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.</description>

Abstract: We illustrate the importance of interference revival, when higher-order corrections are included, by presenting LO and NLO differential cross sections and $K$-factors for three processes that are sensitive to the dimension-6 SMEFT operator $O_W$ : $Z$-plus-two-jets ($Zjj$) through VBF, leptonic diboson $WZ$ and $W\gamma$ production. We show how lifting the interference suppression at LO, through suitable variables and cuts, is necessary to get reliable predictions at NLO. We also present bounds on $C_W /\Lambda^2$ obtained from these observables</description>

Abstract: The intrinsic quantum nature of jets and the Quark-Gluon Plasma makes the study of jet quenching a promising candidate to benefit from quantum computing power. Standing as a precursor of the full study of this phenomenon, we study the propagation of SU(3) partons in Quark-Gluon Plasma using quantum simulation algorithms. The algorithms are developed in detail, and the propagation of both quarks and gluons is analysed and compared with analytical expectations. The results, obtained with quantum simulators, demonstrate that the algorithm successfully simulates parton propagation, yielding results consistent with analytical baseline calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the observables associated with the $B\to\rho\rho$ decays, including branching fractions, $CP$ asymmetry parameters, and longitudinal polarization fractions in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach with a few improvements. The essential distinction between this study and previous works lies in the introduction of an infrared cutoff at the critical scale $\mu_c$, which is approximately at the scale of $1\;\text{GeV}$. The contributions above the critical scale are calculated using the PQCD approach, consistent with earlier studies, while the contributions below the scale $\mu_c$ are regarded as nonperturbative and represented by some soft form factors. In addition, the distribution amplitude of the $B$ meson, derived from the relativistic potential model, and the contributions from the color-octet quark-antiquark components are also taken into account. With these modifications, we find that the theoretical results agree well with the experimental measurements for most observables, the introduction of the infrared cutoff enhances the reliability of the perturbation calculations, and the color-octet contributions play a key role in explaining the experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling of hadron multiplicity distributions, empirically confirmed to hold approximately in $e^+e^-$ collisions and Deep Inelastic Scattering, has been observed to be violated in hadron-hadron collisions. In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be extended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a comprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double logarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling approximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$ range, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels. Especially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling functions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying above that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction is essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC. Furthermore, we propose direct experimental tests of KNO scaling in QCD jets at the LHC through quark-gluon discrimination using jet substructure techniques, as demonstrated by applying energy correlation functions to PYTHIA-generated data.</description>

      <title>Analyzing $t\bar{t}Z$-couplings at the future $e^-p$ collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), with center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}\approx 1.3$ TeV, provides a clean and sensitive environment to probe the top quark's neutral current interactions with the $Z$ boson via the process $e^- p \to e^- t \bar{t}$. We investigate the precision with which the Standard Model (SM) $t\bar{t}Z$ couplings-the vector and axial-vector components ($\Delta C_{1V}$, $\Delta C_{1A}$)-can be measured, along with possible new physics effects parameterized by higher-dimensional operators inducing weak electric and magnetic dipole-like interactions ($C_{2V}$, $C_{2A}$). Focusing on the semileptonic decay channel, where either the top quark or anti-top decays leptonically to a positively charged lepton ($\ell^+ = e^+, \mu^+$), we utilize the azimuthal angle difference $\Delta \phi$ between the scattered electron and the charged lepton as the key observable. Using a one-parameter multi-bin $\chi^2$-analysis of this differential distribution, we find that constraints on $\Delta C_{1V}$ and $\Delta C_{1A}$ improve from order $10^{-1}$ at 50 fb$^{-1}$ to order $10^{-2}$ at 1000 fb$^{-1}$, corresponding to approximately 50% and 6% precision relative to their SM values. The anomalous tensor couplings $C_{2V}$ and $C_{2A}$ are constrained at the $10^{-1}$ level even at low luminosity and improve moderately with high luminosity. While the two-parameter analysis broadens the allowed regions due to parameter correlations, it retains competitive sensitivity, particularly for SM-like couplings. A systematic uncertainty of 5% is assumed throughout. These results highlight the LHeC's potential to provide complementary and competitive sensitivity to top-$Z$ couplings compared to current and future hadron and lepton collider capabilities.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we summarise the recent experimental measurements and theoretical work on Higgs boson production via vector-boson fusion at the LHC. Along with this, we provide state-of-the-art predictions at fixed order as well as with parton-shower corrections within the Standard Model at 13.6 TeV. The results are presented in the form of multi-differential distributions as well as in the Simplified Template Cross Section bins. All materials and outputs of this study are available on public repositories. Finally, following findings in the literature, recommendations are made to estimate theoretical uncertainties related to parton-shower corrections.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

      <title>$gg \to ZH$ : updated predictions at NLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present state-of-the-art predictions for the inclusive cross section of gluon-initiated $ZH$ production, following the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group. In particular, we include NLO QCD corrections, where the virtual corrections are obtained from the combination of a forward expansion and a high-energy expansion, and the real corrections are exact. The expanded results for the virtual corrections are compared in detail to full numerical results. The updated predictions show a reduction of the scale uncertainties to the level of 15%, and they include an estimate of the top-mass-scheme uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff: Chiral Perturbation Theory Tests via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the scattering of GeV energy beam particles off the Coulomb field of a nucleus. In this context, the Coulomb field behaves like a target of $\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with the target density being proportional to Z$^2$. Henry Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the production cross section for the process $\gamma\gamma^* \rightarrow \pi^0$. When a $\gamma$ ray beam is used, Primakoff scattering is effectively represents $\gamma\gamma^*$ scattering involving hundreds of MeV gamma rays. We begin by describing Primakoffs scientific career and personal life. Then, we will review his studies on Primakoff scattering related to pion polarizability and the $\gamma\rightarrow\pi\pi\pi$ chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, as well as the $\pi^0$ lifetime study carried out at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). We highlight the good agreement between these studies and the predictions of 2-flavor (u,d) Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). Additionally, we explain the necessity of future Primakoff reaction studies involving kaons and $\eta$ mesons to evaluate how effectively three-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT accounts for the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Dipole Amplitude in the Dipole Picture as a mathematical Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and precise detector simulation with vision transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed and fidelity of detector simulations in particle physics pose compelling questions about LHC analysis and future colliders. The sparse high-dimensional data, combined with the required precision, provide a challenging task for modern generative networks. We present a comparison between solutions with different trade-offs, including accurate Conditional Flow Matching and faster coupling-based Normalising Flows. Vision Transformers allows us to emulate the energy deposition from detailed Geant4 simulations. We evaluate the networks using high-level observables, neural network classifiers, and sampling timings, showing minimum deviations from Geant4 while achieving faster generation. We use the CaloChallenge benchmark datasets for reproducibility and further development.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the transition form factors of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia and corresponding semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the vector, axial vector and tensor form factors of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia $\psi_J$ ($J=1,2,3$) and $\eta_{c2}$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. With the estimated vector and axial vector form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $B_c\to\psi_Jl\bar{\nu_l}$ and $B_c\to\eta_{c2}l\bar{\nu_l}$. Our results indicate that the semileptonic decay branching ratios of $B_c$ to $D$-wave charmonia decreases as the total angler momentum of the final state $D$-wave charmonia increases. For decay processes $B_c\to \psi_1l\bar{\nu}_l$, $B_c\to \psi_2[\eta_{c2}]l\bar{\nu}_l$ and $B_c\to \psi_3l\bar{\nu}_l$, the branching ratios can reach the order $10^{-3}$, $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$, respectively, which can provide a valuable reference for future experimental measurements for $B_c$ meson by LHCb collaboration. Furthermore, these results also can provide useful information to study the properties of $B_c$ meson and $D$-wave charmonia.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of the $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners in a molecular configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the axial-vector molecular states $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$, which are used to model the charmed states $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. To our knowledge, this presents the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments for these specific molecular configurations. Employing the QCD light-cone sum rule method with molecular-type interpolating currents, we compute these moments and perform a detailed flavor decomposition to reveal the internal distribution of the electromagnetic charge and spin. Our results demonstrate that the light up and down quarks dominate the electromagnetic response, with negligible contributions from the heavy quarks. The $D^* K$ and $B^* K$ states exhibit negative quadrupole moments and slightly oblate charge distributions, whereas the $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ states possess positive quadrupole moments and prolate distributions, with significant contributions from the strange quark. The predicted moments provide benchmarks for lattice QCD calculations and are testable through their influence on radiative transitions and photo- and electro-production observables at high-luminosity facilities, offering crucial insights into the internal structure and nature of these axial-vector states.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Relations and Dispersive Techniques for Precision Multi-Loop Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Toward a holographic realization of the 2+1-flavor QCD phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fully back-reacted Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--flavor model with dynamical light and strange sectors, calibrated to lattice QCD using a machine-learning--assisted spectral method. The model reproduces the 2+1-flavor equation of state and chiral dynamics with quantitative accuracy, and maps the Columbia plot with a tri-critical point at $m_s^{\mathrm{tri}} \simeq 21~\text{MeV}$ and a critical mass $m_c \simeq 0.785~\text{MeV}$, consistent with lattice results. At finite density, it yields a crossover-to-first-order transition and predicts a critical endpoint at $T_C = 75.4~\text{MeV}$ and $\mu_C = 768~\text{MeV}$, within the reach of heavy-ion experiments. These findings establish a unified holographic framework for the QCD phase structure across quark masses and baryon density, providing the first consistent and quantitative description of both deconfinement and chiral transitions within a single holographic model.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witnesses mediated via axionLike particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is solely a quantum property and it can be extremely helpful to test the physics beyond the Standard Model in tabletop experiments with the advent of future quantum technologies. In this work, we provide an entanglement-based partial positive transpose witness for Yukawa-type potentials in the infrared regime between pairs of neutral/charged particles in a spatial quantum superposition. The entanglement is created by the interaction beyond the Standard Model such as axionlike particle or physics motivated by string theory such as extra dimensions in the context of gravity. We will study the constrained couplings in a few different models along with the decoherence rate to show what parameters can be searched for in near-future entanglement-driven experiments for the search of new physics.</description>

      <title>Smoking gun signature from axion and the constraints with radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate. They can convert into photons under a strong magnetic field, while magnetars with extreme magnetic fields are natural labs for axion detection. Radio telescopes can detect the radio emission from axion-photon conversion near magnetars. In this study, we have refined the calculation of axion-photon conversion and developed the matched filtering integration method to largely improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We validate our method using end-to-end simulation and real observational data from TMRT. A new constraint is set with only 687 seconds of observations with TMRT. Using 10 hours of observation with the high-frequency receiver in FAST or SKA, we can reach the theoretical coupling constant prediction for the axion mass range from 1$\mu$eV to 100$\mu$eV. We validate the possibility of axion detection with radio telescopes and avoid spectrum confusion.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on nonphantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$\sigma$+ lensing anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} &gt;1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.</description>
