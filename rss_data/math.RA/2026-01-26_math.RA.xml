      <title>Aggregate Bounds on the eigenvalues of the principal submatrices of a Hermitian matrix and majorization relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend bounds, proved by R.C. Thompson in 1966, on the sum of the $j$-th largest eigenvalues of the $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. Our bounds are stronger than just summing up Thompson's bounds. We achieve the extensions as a corollary of a more general result giving bounds on the zeros of the generalized derivatives of polynomials with real roots. We use the extended bounds to obtain majorization relationships between the eigenvalues of all $m \times m$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. These majorization relationships imply both a well-known majorization result by Schur and the well-known Szasz's inequalities.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory I: Radical Phase Geometry and Structural Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop Algebraic Phase Theory (APT), an axiomatic framework for extracting intrinsic algebraic structure from phase based analytic data. From minimal admissible phase input we prove a general phase extraction theorem that yields algebraic Phases equipped with functorial defect invariants and a uniquely determined canonical filtration. Finite termination of this filtration forces a structural boundary: any extension compatible with defect control creates new complexity strata.
  These mechanisms are verified in the minimal nontrivial setting of quadratic phase multiplication operators over finite rings with nontrivial Jacobson radical. In this case nilpotent interactions produce a finite filtration of quadratic depth, and no higher degree extension is compatible with the axioms. This identifies the radical quadratic Phase as the minimal example in which defect, filtration, and boundary phenomena occur intrinsically.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory II: The Frobenius Heisenberg Phase and Boundary Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect.
  As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schr\"odinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model.
  The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory III: Structural Quantum Codes over Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the quantum component of Algebraic Phase Theory by showing that quantum phase, Weyl noncommutativity, and stabiliser codes arise as unavoidable algebraic consequences of Frobenius duality. Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.
  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.
  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality.</description>

      <title>The embedding of initial algebras into dialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for a given variety $\Var$, we present a universal algorithm that constructs a subvariety of $\Var$-dialgebras from which one can recover an algebra belonging to $\Var$. We call such a variety an initial $\Var$-dialgebra. In addition, we construct the basis of the free initial Lie and associative dialgebras.</description>

      <title>Reduced rank in $\sigma[M]$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the concept of prime submodule introduced by Raggi et.al. we extend the notion of reduced rank to the module-theoretic context of $\sigma[M]$. We study the quotient category of $\sigma[M]$ modulo the hereditary torsion theory cogenerated by the $M$-injective hull of $M$, when $M$ is a semiprime Goldie module. We prove that this quotient category is spectral. We then consider the hereditary torsion theory in $\sigma[M]$ cogenerated by the $M$-injective hull of $M/\mathfrak{L}(M)$, where $\mathfrak{L}(M)$ is the prime radical of $M$, and we determine when the module of quotients of $M$, with respect to this torsion theory, has finite length in the quotient category. Finally, we give conditions on a module $M$ with endomorphism ring $S$ under which $S$ is an order in an Artinian ring, extending Small's Theorem.</description>

      <title>On certain semigroups of finite monotone and order-decreasing partial transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{PMD}_{n}$ be the semigroup consisting of all monotone and order-decreasing partial transformations, and let $\mathcal{IMD}_{n}$ be the subsemigroup of $\mathcal{PMD}_{n}$ consisting of all injective monotone and order-decreasing transformations on the finite chain $X_{n}=\{ 1&lt;\cdots&lt;n \}$. For $2\leq r\leq n$, let $\mathcal{PMD}(n,r) =\{ \alpha\in \mathcal{PMD}_{n} : |\textrm{im}(\alpha)| \leq r\}$ and $\mathcal{IMD}(n,r)=\{ \alpha \in \mathcal{IMD}_{n} :|\textrm{im}(\alpha)| \leq r\}$. In this paper, we determine the cardinalities, maximal subsemigroups and ranks of $\mathcal{PMD}(n,r)$ and $\mathcal{IMD}(n,r)$, and moreover, we verify that the semigroups $\mathcal{PMD}(n,r)$ and $\mathcal{IMD}(n,r)$ are non-regular but abundant for any $2\leq r\leq n$.</description>

      <title>Additive Ternary $\Gamma$-Modules and Homological Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a commutative monoid $(T,+,0)$, a commutative monoid $(\Gamma,+,0_\Gamma)$, and a map \[ (a,\alpha,b,\beta,c)\longmapsto a\,\alpha\,b\,\beta\,c\in T \] which is additive in each variable and associative in the ternary sense. A left additive ternary $\Gamma$-module is an abelian group $M$ equipped with an action $(a,\alpha,b,\beta,m)\mapsto a\,\alpha\,b\,\beta\,m$ satisfying the same associativity constraints. Two scalars are intrinsic, so the action is genuinely polyadic; in particular, we do not assume a canonical unary action $T\times M\to M$. The first part constructs the \emph{operator ring} $\mathcal O_{T,\Gamma}$ generated by the left translations $(a,\alpha,b,\beta)$. It is shown that $T\!\!\;\!-\!\Gamma\mathrm{Mod}$ is equivalent to the ordinary module category $\mathcal O_{T,\Gamma}\mathrm{Mod}$. The category is therefore abelian. Under the unital operator hypothesis \emph{(U)} (i.e. when $\mathcal O_{T,\Gamma}$ is unital), it has enough projectives and enough injectives. The second part defines a tensor product over $T$ by a \emph{bi-balanced} universal property forced by the ternary action, proves right exactness of $-\otimes_T-$, and establishes a Tensor--Hom adjunction for bimodules. Assuming \emph{(U)}, derived functors $\mathrm{Ext}$ and $\mathrm{Tor}$ are developed inside the additive track. A finite example with $T=\ZZ/4\ZZ$ gives explicit computations \[\mathrm{Ext}^1_T(\ZZ/2\ZZ,\ZZ/2\ZZ)\cong \ZZ/2\ZZ,\qquad
  \mathrm{Tor}^T_1(\ZZ/2\ZZ,\ZZ/2\ZZ)\cong \ZZ/2\ZZ,\] with a concrete nonsplit extension and an explicit failure of tensor exactness. Counterexamples isolate the precise points where naive binary-module arguments break.</description>

      <title>A structural classification of algebras with graded involution and quadratic codimension growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of algebras with polynomial identities has developed significantly, with special attention devoted to the classification of varieties according to the asymptotic behavior of their codimension sequences. This sequence is a fundamental numerical invariant, as it captures the growth rate of the polynomial identities of a given algebra. Special partial classification results have been obtained, with particular interest devoted to algebras equipped with additional structure. In this paper, we consider associative G-graded algebras endowed with a graded involution. We provide a complete classification, up to equivalence, of unitary algebras with quadratic codimension growth. Our approach establishes a direct correspondence between the algebras generating minimal varieties and the nonzero multiplicities appearing in the decomposition of the proper cocharacters. As a consequence, we establish that every variety with at most quadratic growth is generated by an algebra that decomposes as a direct sum of algebras generating minimal varieties of at most quadratic growth.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--M\'emoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</description>
