      <title>Parafermions in Moir\'e Minibands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Laser induced $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking in the fluctuations of electronic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic fluids can display exciting dynamical properties. In particular, due to Landau damping, the collective modes spectrum of an electronic system with multipolar interactions is non-hermitian, and can present non-hermitian degeneracies called $\textit{exceptional points}$. In this work, we want to explore the dynamical properties of these degeneracies using laser control. We show that by using a light pulse, we can control the collective mode spectrum and tune a non-hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$ phase transition in which two exceptional points anhilate each other. At this transition, the gap closes with a cubic root signature, what defines a third order exceptional point.</description>

      <title>Comparison of superconducting pairing in doped cuprates and nickelates within an extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within an extended Hubbard model, we investigate the superconducting pairing behavior of infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{NdNiO_2}$ and cuprates superconductors by using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method. Our focus is on comparing their dominant pairing symmetries. The results indicate that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is significantly enhanced at low temperatures in both doped nickelates and cuprates, while other typical pairing symmetries are effectively suppressed, highlighting the dominance of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing form. Additionally, we find that the effective pairing interaction for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing in doped nickelates is slightly lower than that in doped cuprates, which may be attributed to the different degrees of Fermi surface warping caused by the third nearest hopping $t''$. Further studies show that the hole doping and interaction strength have significant effects on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction within the selected parameter range. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing interaction is notably weakened when the hole doping increases, while it is significantly enhanced with increasing Coulomb interaction strength $U$. This comparative analysis reveals the similarities and differences in the pairing behaviors of doped nickelates and cuprates, which may provide further insights into understanding the superconducting properties of these two classes of materials.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic ground state of 4$d^3$ double perovskite ruthenates A$_2$LaRuO$_6$ (A $=$ Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4$d$ transition metal oxide (TMO) offers an intriguing puzzle for their electronic and magnetic ground state. They are in the cross-over regime of strong spin orbit interaction (SOI) and electron-electron correlation ($U$) with quenched orbital angular momentum. Our work unravels the electronic and magnetic ground state of the less investigated 4$d^{3}$ double perovskite ruthenates A$_{2}$LaRuO$_6$ (A = Ca, Ba). The negligible effect of SOI is evident from the bulk magnetic, specific heat measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicating a classical spin-only magnetic ground state (${S}$ = 3/2) for the materials. Magnetization measurements show that both materials have long range antiferromagnetic order with high degree of magnetic frustration ($f$ $\approx$13 -15). Interestingly, a near $T^2$- behavior is observed in low-$T$ magnetic heat capacity measurement, indicating the presence of low-dimensional spin-wave exciation and magnetic frustration in both materials. The temperature dependent resistivity measurements and electronic band structure calculations confirm a conventional Mott insulating ground state in these two systems. Moreover, our experimental investigation and DFT calculations highlight the reason for the nonexistence of Sr$_2$LaRuO$_6$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator candidate in twisted bilayer checkboard lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) candidate arising from Moir\'e bands with higher Chern number C=2 on a magic angle twisted bilayer checkboard lattice (MATBCB). There are two nearly flat low lying bands in the single particle energy spectrum under the first magic angle $\phi\approx 1.608^{\circ}$ and chiral limit. We find MATBCB hosts a nearly uniform Berry curvature distribution and exhibits tiny violation of quantum geometric trace condition in the first moir\'e Brillourin Zone (mBZ), indicating that there is a nearly ideal quantum geometry in MATBCB in single particle level. Turning on projected Coulomb interactions, we perform exact diagonalization and find a ten-fold ground state quasi-degeneracy in many body energy spectrum with filling fraction $\nu=1/5$. The ten-fold quasi-degenrate ground states further show spectra flow under flux pumping. By diagnosing the particle entanglement spectrum (PES) of the ground states, we obtain a clear PES gap and quasi-hole state counting consistent with Halperin spin singlet generalized Pauli principle, suggesting that a fractional Chern insulator is realized in this system.</description>

      <title>Validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem asserts that microscopic details of the system can impose non-trivial constraints on the system's low-energy properties. While traditionally applied to short-range interaction systems, where locality ensures a vanishing spectral gap in large system size limit, the impact of long-range interactions on the LSM theorem remains an open question. Long-range interactions are prevalent in experimental platforms such as Rydberg atoms, dipolar quantum gases, polar molecules, optical cavities, and trapped ions, where the interaction decay exponent can be experimentally tuned. We extend the LSM theorem in one dimension to long-range interacting systems and find that the LSM theorem holds for exponentially or power-law two-body interactions with a decay exponent $\alpha &gt; 2$. However, for power-law interactions with $\alpha &lt; 2$, the constraints of the LSM theorem on the ground state do not apply. Numerical simulations of long-range versions of the Heisenberg and Majumdar-Ghosh models, both satisfying the LSM symmetry requirements, are also provided. Our results suggest promising directions for experimental validation of the LSM theorem in systems with tunable long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological pairing of composite fermions via criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of two-dimensional interacting lattice electrons using symmetry-aware neural backflow transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown to be a powerful tool to represent ground state of quantum many-body systems, including for fermionic systems. In this work, we introduce a framework for embedding lattice symmetries in Neural Slater-Backflow-Jastrow wavefunction ansatzes, and demonstrate how our model allows us to target the ground state and low-lying excited states. To capture the Hamiltonian symmetries, we introduce group-equivariant backflow transformations. We study the low-energy excitation spectrum of the t-V model on a square lattice away from half-filling, and find that our symmetry-aware backflow significantly improves the ground-state energies, and yields accurate low-lying excited states for up to 10x10 lattices. We additionally compute the two-point density-correlation function and the structure factor to detect the phase transition and determine the critical point. Finally, we quantify the variational accuracy of our model using the V-score.</description>

      <title>Spin excitations in Nd1-xSrxNiO2 and YBa2Cu3O7-delta: the influence of Hubbard U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) to compare the doping dependence of magnetic excitations of an Infinite-Layer nickelate to those of a prototypical superconducting cuprate. The polarization analysis of RIXS spectra establishes the dominant spin-flip nature of the mid-infrared peak in both cases. Hole doping leads to opposite behavior of the magnetic energy in the two materials. By fitting the data with an original Hubbard-based model for dynamic susceptibility, we find that t is comparable in the two materials while U is about twice larger in the nickelate. This finding accounts for the smaller magnetic bandwidth of nickelates and for its decrease upon doping.</description>

      <title>Perfectly hidden order and Z2 confinement transition in a fully packed monopole liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a simple variant of spin ice whose degenerate ground states are densely packed monopole configurations. An applied field drives this model through a Z2 confinement transition, in absence of any local order parameter. Instead, this hidden order turns out to be diagnosed by a string order invisible to any local probe. We describe the transition in terms of a bosonic field theory with a pairing term, as well as a Kramers-Wannier duality into a 3D Ising model, which establishes its Z2 nature. This topological transition can be thought of as a variant of the celebrated U(1) Kasteleyn transition; but instead of the traditional '3/2'-order kink, the system shows critical scaling expected near a 3D Ising transition. Remarkably, however, the magnetic response scales with the critical exponent not of the susceptibility, but of the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Symmetry enforced entanglement in maximally mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is typically fragile to interactions with the environment. Generic unital quantum channels, for example, have the maximally mixed state with no entanglement as their unique steady state. However, we find that for a unital quantum channel that is `strongly symmetric', i.e. it preserves a global on-site symmetry, the maximally mixed steady state in certain symmetry sectors can be highly entangled. For a given symmetry, we analyze the entanglement and correlations of the maximally mixed state in the invariant sector (MMIS), and show that the entanglement of formation and distillation are exactly computable and equal for any bipartition. For all Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is separable, and for all non-Abelian symmetries, the MMIS is entangled. Remarkably, for non-Abelian continuous symmetries described by compact semisimple Lie groups (e.g. $SU(2)$), the bipartite entanglement of formation for the MMIS scales logarithmically $\sim \log N$ with the number of qudits $N$.</description>

      <title>Meandering conduction channels and the tunable nature of quantized charge transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect founded the field of topological condensed matter physics. Its amazingly accurate quantisation of the Hall conductance, now enshrined in quantum metrology, is topologically protected: it is stable against any reasonable perturbation. Conversely, topological protection thus implies a form of censorship, as it completely hides any local information from the observer. The spatial distribution of the current in the sample is such a piece of information, which however has now become accessible thanks to spectacular experimental advances. It is an old question whether an original, and intuitively compelling, picture of the current flowing in a narrow channel along the sample edge is the physically correct one. Motivated by recent experiments $\textit{locally}$ imaging the quantized current flow in a Chern insulating (Bi, Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure, [Rosen et al., PRL 129, 246602 (2022); Ferguson et.al, Nat. Mater. 22, 1100-1105 (2023)], we theoretically demonstrate the possibility of a broad `edge state' meandering away from the sample boundary deep into the sample bulk. Further, we show that varying experimental parameters permits continuously tuning between narrow edge states and meandering channels all the way to incompressible bulk transport. This accounts for various features observed in, and differing between, experiments. Overall, this underscores the robustness of topological condensed matter physics, but it also unveils a phenomenological richness hidden by topological censorship -- much of which we believe remains to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Interacting holes in a gated WSe$_2$ quantum channel: valley correlations and zigzag Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of interacting valence holes in a gate-defined one-dimensional quantum channel in a single layer of a transition metal dichalcogenide material WSe$_2$. Based on a microscopic atomistic tight-binding model and Hartree-Fock and exact configuration-interaction tools we demonstrate the possibility of symmetry-broken valley polarized states for strongly interacting holes. The interplay between interactions, perpendicular magnetic field, and the lateral confinement asymmetry together with the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling present in WSe$_2$ material is analyzed, and its impact on valley polarization is discussed. For weaker interactions, an investigation of the pair correlation function reveals a valley-antiferromagnetic phase. For low hole densities, a formation of a zigzag Wigner crystal phase is predicted. The impact of various hole liquid phases on transport in a high mobility quasi-one dimensional channel is discussed.</description>

      <title>Linear spectroscopy of collective modes and the gap structure in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider optical response in multi-band, multi-layer two-dimensional superconductors. Within a simple model, we show that collective modes of the condensate, such as Leggett and clapping modes, can be detected in linear response. We show how trigonal warping of the superconducting order parameter can help facilitate detection of clapping modes. Taking rhombohedral trilayer graphene as an example, we consider several possible pairing mechanisms and show that all-electronic mechanisms may produce in-gap clapping modes. These modes, if present, should be detectable in the absorption of microwaves applied via gate electrodes; their detection would constitute strong evidence for unconventional pairing. Lastly, we show that absorption at frequencies above the superconducting gap $2|\Delta|$ also contains a wealth of information about the gap structure. Our results suggest that linear spectroscopy can be a powerful tool for the characterization of unconventional two-dimensional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Link between cascade transitions and correlated Chern insulators in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chern insulators are topologically non-trivial states of matter characterized by incompressible bulk and chiral edge states. Incorporating topological Chern bands with strong electronic correlations provides a versatile playground for studying emergent quantum phenomena. In this study, we resolve the correlated Chern insulators (CCIs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) through Rydberg exciton sensing spectroscopy, and unveil their direct link with the zero-field cascade features in the electronic compressibility. The compressibility minima in the cascade are found to deviate substantially from nearby integer fillings (by $\Delta\nu$) and coincide with the onsets of CCIs in doping densities, yielding a quasi-universal relation $B_c$=$\Phi_0\Delta\nu/C$ (onset magnetic field $B_c$, magnetic flux quantum $\Phi_0$ and Chern number $C$). We suggest these onsets lie on the intersection where the integer filling of localized "f-orbitals" and Chern bands are simultaneously reached. Our findings update the field-dependent phase diagram of MATBG and directly support the topological heavy fermion model.</description>

      <title>Impact of potential and temperature fluctuations on charge and heat transport in quantum Hall edges in the heat Coulomb blockade regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a broad study of charge and heat transport in a mesoscopic system where one or several quantum Hall edge channels are strongly coupled to a floating Ohmic contact (OC). It is well known that charge-current fluctuations emanating from the OC along the edge channels are highly susceptible to the OC charge capacitance in the heat Coulomb blockade regime (an impeded ability of the OC to equilibrate edge channels). Here, we demonstrate how potential- and temperature fluctuations due to finite OC charge and heat capacities impact the heat-current fluctuations emitted from the OC. First, by assuming an infinite OC heat capacity, we show that the output heat-current noise is strongly dependent on the OC charge capacitance, following from a close relation between one-dimensional charge- and heat currents. When also the OC heat capacity is finite, an interplay of potential- and temperature fluctuations influences the heat transport. Concretely, we find that the effect of the charge capacitance on heat transport manifests in terms of a strongly increased energy relaxation time in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. Furthermore, we find expressions for a broad set of output observables, such as charge and heat auto- and cross correlations, as functions of input and OC fluctuations, depending on the relation between charge and energy relaxation times compared to the frequency of fluctuations and inverse (local) temperatures as well as on the number of edge channels attached to the OC. Finally, we show that a finite OC heat capacity transforms the full counting statistics of the output charge from Gaussian to non-Gaussian. Our findings provide novel opportunities to experimentally probe and harness the quantum nature of heat transport in strongly coupled electron circuits.</description>

      <title>Incorporating static intersite correlation effects in vanadium dioxide through DFT$+V$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) of adding an empirical inter-atomic potential within the density-functional theory$+V$ (DFT$+V$) framework. We use the DFT$+V$ machinery founded on the extended Hubbard model to apply an empirical self-energy correction between nearest-neighbor vanadium atoms in both rutile and monoclinic phases, and for a set of structures interpolating between these two cases. We observe that imposing an explicit intersite interaction $V$ along the vanadium-vanadium chains enhances the characteristic bonding-antibonding splitting of the relevant bands in the monoclinic phase, thus favoring electronic dimerization and the formation of a band gap. We then explore the effect of $V$ on the structural properties and the relative energies of the two phases, finding an insulating global energy minimum for the monoclinic phase, consistent with experimental observations. With increasing $V$, this minimum becomes deeper relative to the rutile structure, and the transition from the metallic to the insulating state becomes sharper. We also analyze the effect of applying the $+V$ correction either to all or only to selected vanadium-vanadium pairs, and both in the monoclinic as well as in the metallic rutile phase. Our results suggest that DFT$+V$ can indeed serve as a computationally inexpensive unbiased way of modeling VO$_2$ which is well suited for studies that, e.g., require large system sizes.</description>

Abstract: The use of a single-qubit parametrized circuit as an Ansatz for the variational wave function in the calculation of the ground state energy of a quantum many-body system is demonstrated using the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Comparison is made to calculations where a classic neural network is used to generate the variational wave function. Computations carried out on IBM Quantum hardware are also presented.</description>

      <title>Electronic Excitations in the Bulk of Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze electronic excitations (excitations generated by adding or removing one electron) in the bulk of fractional quantum Hall states in Jain sequence states, using composite fermion Chern-Simons field theory. Starting from meanfield approximation in which gauge field fluctuations are neglected, we use symmetry to constrain the possible composite fermion states contributing to electronic Green's function and expect discrete infinitely-sharp peaks in the electronic spectral function. We further consider the electronic excitations in particle-hole conjugate fractional quantum hall states. Gauge field fluctuations play an increasingly important role in the electron spectral function as the filling factor approaches 1/2, and evolve the discrete coherent peaks into a broad continuum even in the absence of impurities. At that limit, we switch to the electron perspective and calculate the electron spectral function via linked cluster approximation from the low to intermediate energy range. Finally, we compare our results with recent experiments.</description>

Abstract: For decades, frustrated quantum magnets have been a seed for scientific progress and innovation in condensed matter. As much as the numerical tools for low-dimensional quantum magnetism have thrived and improved in recent years due to breakthroughs inspired by quantum information and quantum computation, higher-dimensional quantum magnetism can be considered as the final frontier, where strong quantum entanglement, multiple ordering channels, and manifold ways of paramagnetism culminate. At the same time, efforts in crystal synthesis have induced a significant increase in the number of tangible frustrated magnets which are generically three-dimensional in nature, creating an urgent need for quantitative theoretical modeling. We review the pseudo-fermion (PF) and pseudo-Majorana (PM) functional renormalization group (FRG) and their specific ability to address higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnetism. First developed more than a decade ago, the PFFRG interprets a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian in terms of Abrikosov pseudofermions, which is then treated in a diagrammatic resummation scheme formulated as a renormalization group flow of $m$-particle pseudofermion vertices. The article reviews the state of the art of PFFRG and PMFRG and discusses their application to exemplary domains of frustrated magnetism, but most importantly, it makes the algorithmic and implementation details of these methods accessible to everyone. By thus lowering the entry barrier to their application, we hope that this review will contribute towards establishing PFFRG and PMFRG as the numerical methods for addressing frustrated quantum magnetism in higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Deconfined pseudocriticality in a model spin-1 quantum antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berry phase interference arguments that underlie the theory of deconfined quantum criticality (DQC) for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnets have also been invoked to allow for continuous transitions in spin-1 magnets including a N\'eel to (columnar) valence bond solid (cVBS) transition. We provide a microscopic model realization of this transition on the square lattice consisting of Heisenberg exchange ($J_H$) and biquadratic exchange ($J_B$) that favor a N\'eel phase, and a designed $Q$-term ($Q_B$) interaction which favors a cVBS through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. For $J_H=0$, this model is equivalent to the $SU(3)$ $JQ$ model with a N\'eel-cVBS transition that has been argued to be DQC through QMC. Upon turning on $J_H$ which brings down the symmetry to $SU(2)$, we find multiple signatures -- a single critical point, high quality collapse of correlation ratios and order parameters, "$U(1)$-symmetric" cVBS histograms and lack of double-peak in order parameter histograms for largest sizes studied near the critical point -- that are highly suggestive of a continuous transition scenario. However, Binder analysis finds negative dips that grow sub-extensively that we interpret as these transitions rather being pseudocritical. This along with recent results on spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models suggests that deconfined pseudocriticality is the more generic scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional interacting quantum fluids, such as the Lieb-Liniger gas. By computing the low-temperature limit of its (generalised) hydrodynamics we show how in this limit the gas is well described by a conventional viscous (Navier-Stokes) hydrodynamics for density, fluid velocity and the local temperature, and the other generalised temperatures in the case of integrable gases. The dynamic viscosity is proportional to temperature and can be expressed in a universal form only in terms of the emergent Luttinger Liquid parameter $K$ and its density. We show that the heating factor is finite even in the zero temperature limit, which implies that viscous contribution remains relevant also at zero temperatures. Moreover, we find that in the semi-classical limit of small couplings, kinematic viscosity diverges, reconciling with previous observations of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in mean-field quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Minimal Pole Representation and Controlled Analytic Continuation of Matsubara Response Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical continuation is a central step in the simulation of finite-temperature field theories in which numerically obtained Matsubara data is continued to the real frequency axis for physical interpretation. Numerical analytic continuation is considered to be an ill-posed problem where uncertainties on the Matsubara axis are aplified exponentially. Here, we present a systematic and controlled procedure that approximates any Matsubara function by a minimal pole representation to within a predefined precision. We then show systematic convergence to the exact spectral function on the real axis as a function of our control parameter for a range of physically relevant setups. Our methodology is robust to noise and paves the way towards reliable analytic continuation in many-body theory and, by providing access to the analytic structure of the functions, direct theoretical interpretation of physical properties.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx 1.080 N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the new universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a charge self-consistent density functional theory combined with the ghost-rotationally-invariant slave-boson (DFT+gRISB) formalism for studying correlated materials. This method is applied to SrVO$_3$ and NiO, representing prototypical correlated metals and charge-transfer insulators. For SrVO$_3$, we demonstrate that DFT+gRISB yields an accurate equilibrium volume and effective mass close to experimentally observed values. Regarding NiO, DFT+gRISB enables the simultaneous description of charge transfer and Mott-Hubbard bands, significantly enhancing the accuracy of the original DFT+RISB approach. Furthermore, the calculated equilibrium volume and spectral function reasonably agree with experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: Multiple software packages currently exist for the computation of bulk topological invariants in both idealized tight-binding models and realistic Wannier tight-binding models derived from density functional theory. Currently, only one package, PythTB(https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) is capable of computing nested Wilson loops and spin-resolved Wilson loops. These state-of-the-art techniques are vital for accurate analysis of band topology. In this paper we introduce BerryEasy, a python package which is built to work alongside the PyBinding(https://docs.pybinding.site/en/stable/index.html) software package. By working in tandem with the Pybinding package and harnessing the speed of graphical processing units, topological analysis of supercells in the presence of disorder and impurities is made possible. The BerryEasy package simultaneously accommodates use of realistic tight-binding models developed using Wannier90.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework that enables a direct calculation of their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed. Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial steady states and long-time dynamics for open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. Notably, we identify a novel $(1+1)$-D mixed-state quantum phase that has no counterpart in closed systems, where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We further establish the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying fault tolerant simulation of strongly correlated systems using the Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of strongly correlated materials is one of the grand challenge problems for physics today. A large class of scientifically interesting materials, from high-$T_c$ superconductors to spin liquids, involve medium to strong correlations, and building a holistic understanding of these materials is critical. Doing so is hindered by the competition between the kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion, which renders both analytic and numerical methods unsatisfactory for describing interacting materials. Fault-tolerant quantum computers have been proposed as a path forward to overcome these difficulties, but this potential capability has not yet been fully assessed. Here, using the multi-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model as a representative model and a source of scalable problem specifications, we estimate the resource costs needed to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for obtaining experimentally relevant quantities such as correlation function estimation. We find that advances in quantum algorithms and hardware will be needed in order to reduce quantum resources and feasibly address utility-scale problem instances.</description>
