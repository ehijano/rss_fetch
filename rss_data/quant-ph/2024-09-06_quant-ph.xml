      <title>Quantum wavepackets: Proofs (almost) without words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometrical way of understanding the dynamics of wavefunctions in a free space, using the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics. By visualizing the Wigner function, the spreading, shearing, the so-called "negative probability flow" of wavefunctions, and the long-time asymptotic dispersion, are intuited visually. These results are not new, but previous derivations were analytical, whereas this paper presents elementary geometric arguments that are almost "proofs without words", and suitable for a first course in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits based on topological pumping in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis of digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate between nearest neighbours, many circuits require non-local connectivity, necessitating some form of quantum information transport, such as the repeated application of SWAP gates or qubit shuttling. Preserving motional coherence during such transport remains a key challenge to improve gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, as well as to connect local fermionic modes. Here we combine tuneable gate operations between fermionic potassium-40 atoms - based on superexchange interaction - with their bidirectional transport via topological Thouless pumping in an optical lattice. We demonstrate shuttling of atomic singlet pairs with a single-shift fidelity of 99.57(4)% over 50 lattice sites. We spatially and coherently split a large number of randomly distributed fermionic spin singlet pairs and show $($SWAP$)^\alpha$-gate operations between atoms encountering each other during transport. As a signature of entanglement between fermions separated over large distances and interwoven with each other, we observe multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Topological pumping is generally applicable to long-lived atomic and molecular states, and specifically overcomes lifetime limitations inherent to transport using state-dependent optical lattices. Our work opens up new avenues for transport of quantum information and offers unprecedented possibilities for engineering connectivity in quantum circuits, including approaches based on fermionic modes, as well as for atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Progress in Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory at the macroscopic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum description of the microscopic world is incompatible with the classical description of the macroscopic world, both mathematically and conceptually. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in the macroscopic limit. In this letter, we challenge this perspective and demonstrate that the behavior of a macroscopic system can retain all aspects of the quantum formalism, in a way that is robust against decoherence, particle losses and coarse-grained (imprecise) measurements. This departure from the expected classical description of macroscopic systems is not merely mathematical but also conceptual, as we show by the explicit violation of a Bell inequality and a Leggett-Garg inequality.</description>

      <title>Random sampling of permutations through quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce classical algorithms for random sampling of permutations, drawing inspiration from the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. Our approach takes a comprehensive view of permutation sampling by expressing them as products of adjacent transpositions. Building on this, we develop a quantum analogue of these classical algorithms using a quantum circuit model for random sampling of permutations for $n$-qubit systems. As an application, we present a quantum algorithm for the two-sample randomization test to assess the difference of means in classical data, utilizing a quantum circuit model. Finally, we propose a nested corona product graph generative model for symmetric groups, which facilitates random sampling of permutations from specific sets of permutations through a quantum circuit model.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric protocols for fast high-fidelity adiabatic state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient control schemes that enable fast, high-fidelity operations are essential for any practical quantum computation. However, current optimization protocols are intractable due to stringent requirements imposed by the microscopic systems encoding the qubit, including dense energy level spectra and cross talk, and generally require a trade-off between speed and fidelity of the operation. Here, we address these challenges by developing a general framework for optimal control based on the quantum metric tensor. This framework allows for fast and high-fidelity adiabatic pulses, even for a dense energy spectrum, based solely on the Hamiltonian of the system instead of the full time evolution propagator and independent of the size of the underlying Hilbert space. Furthermore, the framework suppresses diabatic transitions and state-dependent crosstalk effects without the need for additional control fields. As an example, we study the adiabatic charge transfer in a double quantum dot to find optimal control pulses with improved performance. We show that for the geometric protocol, the transfer fidelites are lower bounded $F&gt;99\%$ for ultrafast 20 ns pulses, regardless of the size of the anti-crossing.</description>

      <title>Real-time operator evolution in two and three dimensions via sparse Pauli dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study real-time operator evolution using sparse Pauli dynamics, a recently developed method for simulating expectation values of quantum circuits. On the examples of energy and charge diffusion in 1D spin chains and sudden quench dynamics in the 2D transverse-field Ising model, it is shown that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art tensor network methods. We further demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by studying quench dynamics in the 3D transverse-field Ising model which is highly challenging for tensor network methods. For the simulation of expectation value dynamics starting in a computational basis state, we introduce an extension of sparse Pauli dynamics that truncates the growing sum of Pauli operators by discarding terms with a large number of X and Y matrices. This is validated by our 2D and 3D simulations. Finally, we argue that sparse Pauli dynamics is not only capable of converging challenging observables to high accuracy, but can also serve as a reliable approximate approach even when given only limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</description>

      <title>QHDOPT: A Software for Nonlinear Optimization with Quantum Hamiltonian Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an open-source, end-to-end software (named QHDOPT), which can solve nonlinear optimization problems using the quantum Hamiltonian descent (QHD) algorithm. QHDOPT offers an accessible interface and automatically maps tasks to various supported quantum backends (i.e., quantum hardware machines). These features enable users, even those without prior knowledge or experience in quantum computing, to utilize the power of existing quantum devices for nonlinear and nonconvex optimization tasks. In its intermediate compilation layer, QHDOPT employs SimuQ, an efficient interface for Hamiltonian-oriented programming, to facilitate multiple algorithmic specifications and ensure compatible cross-hardware deployment. The detailed documentation of QHDOPT is available at https://github.com/jiaqileng/QHDOPT.</description>

      <title>High Energy Physics from Low Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation between physics at low and high energies is essential for physics to have any utility; the details of quantum gravity are not necessary to calculate the trajectory of a cannon ball. However, physics at low and high energies are not completely independent, and this thesis explores two ways that they are related. The first is through a UV/IR symmetry that relates scattering processes at low and high energies. This UV/IR symmetry manifests in geometrical properties of the $S$-matrix, and of the RG flow of the coupling constants in the corresponding effective field theory. Low energy nuclear physics nearly realizes this UV/IR symmetry, providing an explanation for the smallness of shape parameters in the effective range expansion of nucleon-nucleon scattering, and inspiring a new way to organize the interactions between neutrons and protons. The second is through the use of quantum computers to simulate lattice gauge theories. Quantum simulations rely on the universality of the rules of quantum mechanics, which can be applied equally well to describe a (low energy) transmon qubit at 15 milli-Kelvin as a (high energy) 1 TeV quark. This thesis presents the first simulations of one dimensional lattice quantum chromodynamics on a quantum computer, culminating in a real-time simulation of beta-decay. Results from the first simulations of a lattice gauge theory on 100+ qubits of a quantum computer are also presented. The methods developed in this thesis for quantum simulation are ``physics-aware", and are guided by the symmetries and hierarchies in length scales of the systems being studied. Without these physics-aware methods, 100+ qubit simulations of lattice gauge theories would not have been possible on the noisy quantum computers that are presently available.</description>

      <title>DasAtom: A Divide-and-Shuttle Atom Approach to Quantum Circuit Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom (NA) quantum systems are emerging as a leading platform for quantum computation, offering superior or competitive qubit count and gate fidelity compared to superconducting circuits and ion traps. However, the unique features of NA devices, such as long-range interactions, long qubit coherence time, and the ability to physically move qubits, present distinct challenges for quantum circuit compilation. In this paper, we introduce DasAtom, a novel divide-and-shuttle atom approach designed to optimise quantum circuit transformation for NA devices by leveraging these capabilities. DasAtom partitions circuits into subcircuits, each associated with a qubit mapping that allows all gates within the subcircuit to be directly executed. The algorithm then shuttles atoms to transition seamlessly from one mapping to the next, enhancing both execution efficiency and overall fidelity. For a 30-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), DasAtom achieves a 414x improvement in fidelity over the move-based algorithm Enola and a 10.6x improvement over the SWAP-based algorithm Tetris. Notably, this improvement is expected to increase exponentially with the number of qubits, positioning DasAtom as a highly promising solution for scaling quantum computation on NA platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Catalytic Amplification of Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation and transformation of quantum resources are key parts of quantum mechanics. Among them, asymmetry is one of the most useful operational resources, which is widely used in quantum clocks, quantum metrology, and other tasks. Recent studies have shown that the asymmetry of quantum states can be significantly amplified with the assistance of correlating catalysts which are finite-dimensional auxiliaries. In the experiment, we perform translationally invariant operations, ensuring that the asymmetric resources of the entire system remain non-increasing, on a composite system composed of a catalytic system and a quantum system. The experimental results demonstrate an asymmetry amplification of 0.0172\pm0.0022 in the system following the catalytic process. Our work showcases the potential of quantum catalytic processes and is expected to inspire further research in the field of quantum resource theories.</description>

      <title>On chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum entanglement is an important resource for emerging quantum technologies such as quantum communication and quantum computation. The scalability of metres-long experimental setups limits high-dimensional entanglement in bulk optics. Advancements in quantum technology hinge on reproducible, and reconfigurable quantum devices -- including photon sources, which are challenging to achieve in a scalable manner using bulk optics. Advances in nanotechnology and CMOS-compatible integration techniques have enabled the generation of entangled photons on millimeter-scale chips, significantly enhancing scalability, stability, replicability, and miniaturization for real-world quantum applications. In recent years we have seen several chip-scale demonstrations with different degrees of freedom including path, frequency-bin, time-bin, and transverse modes, on many material platforms. A complete quantum photonic integrated circuit requires the generation, manipulation, and detection of qudits, involving various active and passive quantum photonic components which further increase the degree of complexity. Here, we review and introduce the nonlinear optical processes that facilitate on-chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources and the currently used material platforms. We discuss a range of current implementations of on-chip high-dimensional entangled photon sources and demonstrated applications. We comment on the current challenges due to the limitations of individual material platforms and present future opportunities in hybrid and heterogeneous integration strategies for the next generation of integrated quantum photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Learning Dynamics in Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) excel on tasks using functional data, such as those originating from partial differential equations. Such characteristics render them an effective approach for simulating the time evolution of quantum wavefunctions, which is a computationally challenging, yet coveted task for understanding quantum systems. In this manuscript, we use FNOs to model the evolution of random quantum spin systems, so chosen due to their representative quantum dynamics and minimal symmetry. We explore two distinct FNO architectures and examine their performance for learning and predicting time evolution using both random and low-energy input states. Additionally, we apply FNOs to a compact set of Hamiltonian observables ($\sim\text{poly}(n)$) instead of the entire $2^n$ quantum wavefunction, which greatly reduces the size of our inputs and outputs and, consequently, the requisite dimensions of the resulting FNOs. Moreover, this Hamiltonian observable-based method demonstrates that FNOs can effectively distill information from high-dimensional spaces into lower-dimensional spaces. The extrapolation of Hamiltonian observables to times later than those used in training is of particular interest, as this stands to fundamentally increase the simulatability of quantum systems past both the coherence times of contemporary quantum architectures and the circuit-depths of tractable tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm For Testing Convexity of Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functions are a fundamental object in mathematics, with countless applications to different fields, and are usually classified based on certain properties, given their domains and images. An important property of a real-valued function is its convexity, which plays a very crucial role in many areas, such as thermodynamics and geometry. Motivated by recent advances in quantum computation as well as the quest for quantum advantage, we give a quantum algorithm for testing convexity of polynomial functions, which appears frequently in multiple contexts, such as optimization, machine learning, physics, etc. We show that quantum computers can reveal the convexity property superpolynomially faster than classical computers with respect to number of variables. As a corollary, we provide a significant improvement and extension on quantum Newton's method constructed in earlier work of Rebentrost et al [New J. Phys. \textbf{21} 073023 (2019)]. We further discuss our algorithm in a broader context, such as potential application in the study of geometric structure of manifold, testing training landscape of variational quantum algorithm and also gradient descent/Newton's method for optimization.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Noise Rates and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</description>

      <title>Four-order power reduction in nanoscale electron-nuclear double resonance with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting nuclear spins using single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers is of particular importance in nano-scale science and engineering, but often suffers from the heating effect of microwave fields for spin manipulation, especially under high magnetic fields. Here, we realize an energy-efficient nano-scale nuclear-spin detection using a phase-modulation electron-nuclear double resonance scheme. The microwave field can be reduced to 1/250 of previous requirements and the corresponding power is over four orders lower. Meanwhile, the microwave-induced broadening to the line-width of the spectroscopy is significantly canceled and we achieve a nuclear-spin spectrum with a resolution down to 2.1 kHz under a magnetic field at 1840 Gs. The spectral resolution can be further improved by upgrading the experimental control precision. This scheme can also be used in sensing microwave fields and extended to a wide range of applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Direct Readout of Nitrogen-Vacancy Hybrid-Spin Quantum Register in Diamond by Photon Arrival Time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state readout plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, spanning applications in sensing, computation, and secure communication. In this work, we introduce a new approach for efficiently reading populations of hybrid-spin states in the nitrogen-vacancy center of diamond using a single laser pulse, which utilizes the excited state level anti-crossing mechanism at around 500 Gs. Reading spin state populations through this approach achieves the same outcome as traditional quantum state diagonal tomography but significantly reduces the experimental time by an order of magnitude while maintaining fidelity. Moreover, this approach may be extended to encompass full-state tomography, thereby obviating the requirement for a sequence of spin manipulations and mitigating errors induced by decoherence throughout the procedure.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the Hamilton Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum mechanics is finding the correct quantum image of a classical observable that would correspond to experimental measurements. We investigate for the appropriate quantization rule that would yield a Hamiltonian that obeys the quantum analogue of Hamilton's equations of motion, which includes differentiation of operators with respect to another operator. To give meaning to this type of differentiation, Born and Jordan established two definitions called the differential quotients of first type and second type. In this paper we modify the definition for the differential quotient of first type and establish its consistency with the differential quotient of second type for different basis operators corresponding to different quantizations. Theorems and differentiation rules including differentiation of operators with negative powers and multiple differentiation were also investigated. We show that the Hamiltonian obtained from Weyl, simplest symmetric, and Born-Jordan quantization all satisfy the required algebra of the quantum equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the performance of Variational Quantum Classifiers with hybrid autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) lie at the forefront of quantum machine learning research. Still, the use of quantum networks for real data processing remains challenging as the number of available qubits cannot accommodate a large dimensionality of data --if the usual angle encoding scenario is used. To achieve dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis is routinely applied as a pre-processing method before the embedding of the classical features on qubits. In this work, we propose an alternative method which reduces the dimensionality of a given dataset by taking into account the specific quantum embedding that comes after. This method aspires to make quantum machine learning with VQCs more versatile and effective on datasets of high dimension. At a second step, we propose a quantum inspired classical autoencoder model which can be used to encode information in low latent spaces. The power of our proposed models is exhibited via numerical tests. We show that our targeted dimensionality reduction method considerably boosts VQC's performance and we also identify cases for which the second model outperforms classical linear autoencoders in terms of reconstruction loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of QKD systems in Metro optical networks raises challenges which cannot be completely resolved with the current technological status. In this work we devise a methodology for identifying different kind of impairments which may occur on the quantum channel during its transmission in an operational network. The methodology is built around a supervised ML pipeline which is using as input QBER and SKR time-series and requires no further interventions on the QKD system. The identification of impairments happens in real time and even though such information cannot reverse incidents, this can be valuable for users, operators and key management system.</description>

      <title>Characteristic time operators as quantum clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the characteristic time operator $\operator{T}$ which is bounded and self-adjoint. For a semibounded and discrete Hamiltonian $\operator{H}$ whose energy eigenvalues satisfy $\sum_s E_s^{-2} &lt; \infty$, the characteristic time operator satisfies the canonical relation $[\operator{T},\operator{H}]\ket{\psi}=i\hbar\ket{\psi}$ for $\ket{\psi}$ in a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. While these bounded time operators are not covariant, we show that they still satisfy the canonical relation in a set of times of total measure zero which we refer to as the time invariant set $\mathscr{T}$. In the neighborhood of each time $t$ in $\mathscr{T}$, this time operator $\operator{T}$ is still canonically conjugate to $\operator{H}$ and thus moves in step with parametric time, and its expectation value gives the parametric time. Its two-dimensional projection saturates the time-energy uncertainty relation in the neighborhood of $\mathscr{T}$, and is proportional to the Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$. Thus, one can construct a quantum clock that tells the time in the neighborhood of $\mathscr{T}$ by measuring a compatible observable. In a Larmor clock for example, measurement of the spin $\operator{S}_y$ can be used to yield the parametric time in the neighborhood of its period.</description>

      <title>Accelerating multipartite entanglement generation in non-Hermitian superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are susceptible to losses in information, energy, and particles due to their surrounding environment. One novel strategy to mitigate these losses is to transform them into advantages for quantum technologies through tailored non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this work, we theoretically propose a fast generation of multipartite entanglement in non-Hermitian qubits. Our findings reveal that weakly coupled non-Hermitian qubits can accelerate multiparty entanglement generation by thousands of times compared to Hermitian qubits, in particular when approaching the $2^n$-th order exceptional points of $n$ qubits in the ${\cal P}{\cal T}-$ symmetric regime. Furthermore, we show that Hermitian qubits can generate GHZ states with a high fidelity more than $0.9995$ in a timescale comparable to that of non-Hermitian qubits, but at the expense of intense driving and large coupling constant. Our approach is scalable to a large number of qubits, presenting a promising pathway for advancing quantum technologies through the non-Hermiticity and higher-order exceptional points in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Density Matrices via Dense Dual Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient understanding of a quantum system fundamentally relies on the selection of observables. Pauli observables and mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are widely used in practice and are often regarded as theoretically optimal for quantum state tomography (QST). However, Pauli observables require a large number of measurements for complete tomography and do not permit direct measurement of density matrix elements with a constant number of observables. For MUBs, the existence of complete sets of \(d+1\) bases in all dimensions remains unresolved, highlighting the need for alternative observables. In this work, we introduce a novel set of \(2d\) observables specifically designed to enable the complete characterization of any \(d\)-dimensional quantum state. To demonstrate the advantages of these observables, we explore two key applications. First, we show that direct measurement of density matrix elements is feasible without auxiliary systems, with any element extractable using only three selected observables. Second, we demonstrate that QST for unknown rank-\(r\) density matrices, excluding only a negligible subset, can be achieved with \(O(r \log d)\) observables. This significantly reduces the number of unitary operations compared to compressed sensing with Pauli observables, which typically require \(O(r d \log^2 d)\) operations. Each circuit is iteratively generated and can be efficiently decomposed into at most \(O(n^4)\) elementary gates for an \(n\)-qubit system. The proposed observables represent a substantial advancement in the characterization of quantum systems, enhancing both the efficiency and practicality of quantum state learning and offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Purification of Gaussian States by Photon Subtraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon subtraction can enhance entanglement, which for pure states induces a decrease in the purity of reduced states. In contrast, by analyzing the purities of Gaussian states before and after subtracting a single photon, we prove that the purity of a Gaussian state can also be increased by less than 20%. On the one hand, it reveals that photon subtraction can reduce entanglement, and on the other hand, it reveals that it can achieve a limited amount of Gaussian state purification. Through the analysis of some examples, we demonstrate the inherent mechanism and applicable scope of photon-subtraction-based purification. In a multimode system, we find that photon subtraction can increase entanglement and purify some of the reduced states simultaneously. We thus present purification through the suppression of Gaussian noise as a new application for photon subtraction in continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Generating arbitrary superpositions of nonclassical quantum harmonic oscillator states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full coherent control and generation of superpositions of the quantum harmonic oscillator are not only of fundamental interest but are crucial for applications in quantum simulations, quantum-enhanced metrology and continuous-variable quantum computation. The extension of such superpositions to nonclassical states increases their power as a resource for such applications. Here, we create arbitrary superpositions of nonclassical and non-Gaussian states of a quantum harmonic oscillator using the motion of a trapped ion coupled to its internal spin states. We interleave spin-dependent nonlinear bosonic interactions and mid-circuit measurements of the spin that preserve the coherence of the oscillator. These techniques enable the creation of superpositions between squeezed, trisqueezed, and quadsqueezed states, which have never been demonstrated before, with independent control over the complex-valued squeezing parameter and the probability amplitude of each constituent, as well as their spatial separation. We directly observe the nonclassical nature of these states in the form of Wigner negativity following a full state reconstruction. Our methods apply to any system where a quantum harmonic oscillator is coupled to a spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate experimentally the undirected open microwave network $\Gamma $ with internal absorption composed of two coupled directed halves, unidirectional networks $\Gamma_{+} $ and $\Gamma_{-} $, corresponding to two possible directions of motion on their edges. The two-port scattering matrix of the network $\Gamma$ is measured and the spectral statistics and the elastic enhancement factor of the network are evaluated. The comparison of the number of experimental resonances with the theoretical one predicted by the Weyl's law shows that within the experimental resolution the resonances are doubly degenerate. This conclusion was also corroborated by the numerical calculations. Though the network is characterized by the time reversal symmetry the missing level spectral statistics and the elastic enhancement factor are rather close to the Gaussian unitary ensemble predictions in random matrix theory. We used numerical calculations for the open non-dissipative quantum graph possessing the same structure as the microwave network $\Gamma$ to investigate the doublet structures in the spectrum which otherwise would not be experimentally resolved. We show that the doublet size distribution is close to the Poisson distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, digitized-counterdiabatic (CD) corrections to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) have been proposed, yielding faster convergence within the desired accuracy than standard QAOA. In this manuscript, we apply this approach to a fully-connected spin model with random couplings. We show that the performances of the algorithm are related to the spectral properties of the instances analyzed. In particular, the larger the gap between the ground state and the first excited states, the better the convergence to the exact solution.</description>

      <title>Local Measurement Scheme of Gravitational Curvature using Atom Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light pulse atom interferometers (AIFs) are exquisite quantum probes of spatial inhomogeneity and gravitational curvature. Moreover, detailed measurement and calibration are necessary prerequisites for very-long-baseline atom interferometry (VLBAI). Here we present a method in which the differential signal of two co-located interferometers singles out a phase shift proportional to the curvature of the gravitational potential. The scale factor depends only on well controlled quantities, namely the photon wave number, the interferometer time and the atomic recoil, which allows the curvature to be accurately inferred from a measured phase. As a case study, we numerically simulate such a co-located gradiometric interferometer in the context of the Hannover VLBAI facility and prove the robustness of the phase shift in gravitational fields with complex spatial dependence. We define an estimator of the gravitational curvature for non-trivial gravitational fields and calculate the trade-off between signal strength and estimation accuracy with regard to spatial resolution. As a perspective, we discuss the case of a time-dependent gravitational field and corresponding measurement strategies.</description>

      <title>Temperature shift of magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence features of nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently significant attention has been paid to magnetic-field-dependent photoluminescence (PL) features of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These features are used for microwave-free sensing and are indicative of the spin-bath properties in the diamond sample. Examinating the temperature dependence of the PL features allows to identify both temperature dependent and independent features, and to utilize them in diamond-based quantum sensing and dynamic nuclear polarization applications. Here, we study the thermal variability of many different features visible in a wide range of magnetic fields. To this end, we first discuss the origin of the features and tentatively assign the previously unidentified features to cross relaxation of NV center containing multi-spin systems. The experimental results are compared with theoretically predicted temperature shifts deduced from a combination of thermal expansion and electron-phonon interactions. A deeper insight into the thermal behavior of a wide array of the features may come with important consequences for various applications in high-precision NV thermometry, gyroscopes, solid-state clocks, and biomagnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>On the Relativistic Zero Knowledge Quantum Proofs of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of relativistic zero-knowledge quantum proof of knowledge systems with classical communication, formally defining a number of useful concepts and constructing appropriate knowledge extractors for all the existing protocols in the relativistic setting which satisfy a weaker variant of the special soundness property due to Unruh (EUROCRYPT 2012). We show that there exists quantum proofs of knowledge with knowledge error 1/2 + negl({\eta}) for all relations in NP via a construction of such a system for the Hamiltonian cycle relation using a general relativistic commitment scheme exhibiting the fairly-binding property due to Fehr and Fillinger (EUROCRYPT 2016). We further show that one can construct quantum proof of knowledge extractors for proof systems which do not exhibit special soundness, and therefore require an extractor to rewind multiple times. We develop a new multi-prover quantum rewinding technique by combining ideas from monogamy of entanglement and gentle measurement lemmas that can break the quantum rewinding barrier. Finally, we prove a new bound on the impact of consecutive measurements and use it to significantly improve the soundness bound of some existing relativistic zero knowledge proof systems, such as the one due to Chailloux and Leverrier (EUROCRYPT 2017).</description>

      <title>Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Corrections for Small Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). QNGGC is specifically designed for small, shallow quantum circuits. We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum complexity and localization in random quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum complexity has emerged as a central concept in diverse areas of physics, ranging from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. We perform a systematic study of complexity in random quantum circuits with and without measurements. We observe that complexity grows linearly before saturating to a constant value. For $N$ qubits without measurements, the saturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$. This behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with different probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is insensitive to the rate of measurement. We also study the behaviour of complexity in two variants of the random unitary floquet circuit, where we observe that complexity acts as a novel probe of Anderson localization and many-body localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence that a photon can spend a negative amount of time in an atom cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a pulse of light traverses a material, it incurs a time delay referred to as the group delay. Should the group delay experienced by photons be attributed to the time they spend as atomic excitations? However reasonable this connection may seem, it appears problematic when the frequency of the light is close to the atomic resonance, as the group delay becomes negative in this regime. To address this question, we use the cross-Kerr effect to probe the degree of atomic excitation caused by a resonant transmitted photon, by measuring the phase shift on a separate beam that is weak and off-resonant. Our results, over a range of pulse durations and optical depths, are consistent with the recent theoretical prediction that the mean atomic excitation time caused by a transmitted photon (as measured via the time integral of the observed phase shift) equals the group delay experienced by the light. Specifically, we measure mean atomic excitation times ranging from $(-0.82\pm 0.31) \tau_0$ for the most narrowband pulse to $(0.54\pm 0.28) \tau_0$ for the most broadband pulse, where $\tau_0$ is the non-post-selected excitation time, given by the scattering (absorption) probability multiplied by the atomic lifetime $\tau_{\rm sp}$. These results suggest that negative values taken by times such as the group delay have more physical significance than has generally been appreciated.</description>

      <title>Predicting quantum channels over general product distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of predicting the output behavior of unknown quantum channels. Given query access to an $n$-qubit channel $E$ and an observable $O$, we aim to learn the mapping \begin{equation*}
  \rho \mapsto \mathrm{Tr}(O E[\rho]) \end{equation*} to within a small error for most $\rho$ sampled from a distribution $D$. Previously, Huang, Chen, and Preskill proved a surprising result that even if $E$ is arbitrary, this task can be solved in time roughly $n^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, where $\epsilon$ is the target prediction error. However, their guarantee applied only to input distributions $D$ invariant under all single-qubit Clifford gates, and their algorithm fails for important cases such as general product distributions over product states $\rho$.
  In this work, we propose a new approach that achieves accurate prediction over essentially any product distribution $D$, provided it is not "classical" in which case there is a trivial exponential lower bound. Our method employs a "biased Pauli analysis," analogous to classical biased Fourier analysis. Implementing this approach requires overcoming several challenges unique to the quantum setting, including the lack of a basis with appropriate orthogonality properties. The techniques we develop to address these issues may have broader applications in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated quantum gates in trapped ions coupled to an ultracold atomic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions between trapped ions in the presence of an ultracold atomic gas. By deriving and solving a master equation to describe the combined system, we show that the presence of the atoms causes the quantum gate quality to reduce because of motional decoherence. On the other hand, we calculate that the gas may be used to keep the ion crystal cold in the presence of external heating due to electric field noise. We show that tuning the atom-ion scattering length allows to tune the cooling rate of the ions and would make it possible to temporarily reduce the effects of the gas during a quantum gate while keeping the ions cold over long timescales. In this way, the trapped ion quantum computer may be buffer gas cooled. The system may also be used for quantum-enhanced measurements of the atom-ion interactions or properties of the atomic bath.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Assisted Parameterized Circuit Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard compilers for quantum circuits decompose arbitrary single-qubit gates into a sequence of physical X(pi/2) pulses and virtual-Z phase gates. Consequently, many circuit classes implement different logic operations but have an equivalent structure of physical pulses that only differ by changes in virtual phases. When many structurally-equivalent circuits need to be measured, generating sequences for each circuit is unnecessary and cumbersome, since compiling and loading sequences onto classical control hardware is a primary bottleneck in quantum circuit execution. In this work, we develop a hardware-assisted protocol for executing parameterized circuits on our FPGA-based control hardware, QubiC. This protocol relies on a hardware-software co-design technique in which software identifies structural equivalency in circuits and "peels" off the relevant parameterized angles to reduce the overall waveform compilation time. The hardware architecture then performs real-time "stitching" of the parameters in the circuit to measure circuits that implement a different overall logical operation. This work demonstrates significant speed ups in the total execution time for several different classes of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Halving the Cost of Quantum Algorithms with Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a systematic framework for implementing a polynomial transformation of a linear operator, and unifies nearly all known quantum algorithms. In parallel, recent works have developed randomized compiling, a technique that promotes a unitary gate to a quantum channel and enables a quadratic suppression of error (i.e., $\epsilon \rightarrow O(\epsilon^2)$) at little to no overhead. Here we integrate randomized compiling into QSP through Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm implements a probabilistic mixture of polynomials, strategically chosen so that the average evolution converges to that of a target function, with an error quadratically smaller than that of an equivalent individual polynomial. Because nearly all QSP-based algorithms exhibit query complexities scaling as $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- stemming from a result in functional analysis -- this error suppression reduces their query complexity by a factor that asymptotically approaches $1/2$. By the unifying capabilities of QSP, this reduction extends broadly to quantum algorithms, which we demonstrate on algorithms for real and imaginary time evolution, phase estimation, ground state preparation, and matrix inversion.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Simulating Fermions, Bosons, and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S))$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work establishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as a viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A neural processing approach to quantum state discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although linear quantum amplification has proven essential to the processing of weak quantum signals, extracting higher-order quantum features such as correlations in principle demands nonlinear operations. However, nonlinear processing of quantum signals is often associated with non-idealities and excess noise, and absent a general framework to harness nonlinearity, such regimes are typically avoided. Here we present a framework to uncover general quantum signal processing principles of a broad class of bosonic quantum nonlinear processors (QNPs), inspired by a remarkably analogous paradigm in nature: the processing of environmental stimuli by nonlinear, noisy neural ensembles, to enable perception. Using a quantum-coherent description of a QNP monitoring a quantum signal source, we show that quantum nonlinearity can be harnessed to calculate higher-order features of an incident quantum signal, concentrating them into linearly-measurable observables, a transduction not possible using linear amplifiers. Secondly, QNPs provide coherent nonlinear control over quantum fluctuations including their own added noise, enabling noise suppression in an observable without suppressing transduced information, a paradigm that bears striking similarities to optimal neural codings that allow perception even under highly stochastic neural dynamics. Unlike the neural case, we show that QNP-engineered noise distributions can exhibit non-classical correlations, providing a new means to harness resources such as entanglement. Finally, we show that even simple QNPs in realistic measurement chains can provide enhancements of signal-to-noise ratio for practical tasks such as quantum state discrimination. Our work provides pathways to utilize nonlinear quantum systems as general computation devices, and enables a new paradigm for nonlinear quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic gravity in which the spacetime metric is a random variable and the spacetime manifold is a fluctuating physical system at a certain length scale is investigated. We will propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The Bose-Einstein occupation number $N_g$ for gravitons can be large enough to be the particle components of the gravitational random metric fluctuations in a physical system. The stochastic gravitational noise produced by the gravitons displaces a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations of a large number of gravitons causing a Brownian motion displacement $\Delta x$ of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects on Cosmic Scales as an Alternative to Dark Matter and Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-torsion theory is a gauge theory approach to gravity that expands upon Einstein's general relativity (GR) by incorporating the spin of microparticles. In this study, we further develop the spin-torsion theory to examine spherically symmetric and static gravitational systems that involve free-falling macroscopic particles. We posit that the quantum spin of macroscopic matter becomes noteworthy at cosmic scales. We further assume that the Dirac spinor and Dirac equation adequately capture all essential physical characteristics of the particles and their associated processes. A crucial aspect of our approach involves substituting the constant mass in the Dirac equation with a scale function, allowing us to establish a connection between quantum effects and the scale of gravitational systems. This mechanism ensures that the quantum effect of macroscopic matter is scale-dependent and diminishes locally, a phenomenon not observed in microparticles. For any given matter density distribution, our theory predicts an additional quantum term, the quantum potential energy (QPE), within the mass expression. The QPE induces time dilation and distance contraction, and thus mimics a gravitational well. When applied to cosmology, the QPE serves as a counterpart to the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein to balance gravity in his static cosmological model. The QPE also offers a plausible explanation for the origin of Hubble redshift (traditionally attributed to the universe's expansion). The predicted luminosity distance--redshift relation aligns remarkably well with SNe Ia data from the cosmological sample of SNe Ia. In the context of galaxies, the QPE functions as the equivalent of dark matter. The predicted circular velocities align well with rotation curve data from the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves database) sample.</description>

Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown by analyzing the $1D$ Schr\"odinger equation the discontinuities in the coupling constant can occur in both the energies and the eigenfunctions. Surprisingly, those discontinuities, which are present in the energies versus the coupling constant, are of three types only: (i) discontinuous energies (similar to the 1st order phase transitions), (ii) discontinuous first derivative in the energy while the energy is continuous (similar to the 2nd order phase transitions), (ii) the energy and all its derivatives are continuous but the functions are different below and above the point of discontinuity (similar to the infinite order phase transitions). Supersymmetric (SUSY) Quantum Mechanics provides a convenient framework to study this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Exceptional topology in Non-Hermitian Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene has extraordinary electronic properties at the magic angle along with an isolated flat band at magic angle. However, the non-Hermitian phenomena in twisted bilayer graphene remain unexplored. In this work, we study a non-Hermitian TBG formed by one-layer graphene twisted relative to another layer with gain and loss. Using a non-Hermitian generalization of Bistritzer-MacDonald(BM) model, we find Dirac cones centered at $K'$ corner of the moir\'e Brillouin zone deformed in the presence of non-Hermiticity. This is different from single layer graphene with gain and loss, where rings of exceptional points appear in both $K$ and $K'$ corners of the Brillouion zone. The coincident of exceptional rings at $\Gamma_M$ point characterizes an ``exceptional magic angle", at which the system hosts flat bands with zero energy and finite lifetime. More interestingly, we find that the topological charge in the moir\'e Brillouin zone is conserved during the expansion and fusion of the exceptional ring, which is absent in two-dimensional systems constraining by Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. These findings can be demonstrated in realistic cold atom and metamaterial systems and will stimulate further study on non-Hermitian phenomena in twistronic.</description>

      <title>Regimes of Steady-State Turbulence in a Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to model the development of turbulence in a quantum fluid confined by a cuboid box potential, and forced by shaking along one axis. We observe the development of isotropic turbulence from anisotropic forcing for a broad range of forcing amplitudes, and characterise the states through their Fourier spectra, vortex distributions, and spatial correlations. For weak forcing the steady-state wave-action spectrum exhibits a $k^{-3.5}$ scaling over wavenumber $k$; further decomposition uncovers the same power law in both compressible kinetic energy and quantum pressure, while the bulk superfluid remains phase coherent and free from extended vortices. As the forcing energy exceeds the chemical potential, extended vortices develop in the bulk, disrupting the $k^{-3.5}$ scaling. The spectrum then transitions to a $k^{-7/3}$ regime for compressible kinetic energy only, associated with dense vortex turbulence, and phase coherence limited to the healing length. The strong forcing regime is consistent with an inverse cascade of compressible energy driven by small-scale vortex annihilation.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Scalability and Accuracy of Variational Quantum Linear Solver for Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solution for non-linear, complex partial differential Equations (PDEs) is achieved through numerical approximations, which yield a linear system of equations. This approach is prevalent in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but it restricts the mesh size since the solution of the linear system becomes computationally intractable when the mesh resolution increases. The reliance on the ability of High-Performance Computers (HPC) to scale up and meet these requirements is myopic; such very high-fidelity simulations require a paradigm shift in computing. This paper presents an exploration of quantum methodologies aimed at achieving high accuracy in solving such a large system of equations.
  Leveraging recent works in Quantum Linear Solver Algorithms (QLSA) and variational algorithms suitable for Quantum Simulation in HPC, we aspire to push the boundaries of CFD-relevant problems that can be solved on hybrid quantum-classical framework. To this end, we consider the 2D, transient, incompressible, viscous, non-linear coupled Burgers equation as a test problem and investigate the accuracy of our approach by comparing results with a classical linear system of equation solvers, such as the Generalized Minimal RESidual method (GMRES). Through rigorous testing, our findings demonstrate that our quantum methods yield results comparable in accuracy to traditional approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and consistency of our quantum method. Lastly, we present an insightful estimation of the resources our quantum algorithm needs to solve systems with nearly 2 billion mesh points.</description>

      <title>Absorbing state transitions with long-range annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of classical stochastic processes describing diffusive particles undergoing branching and long-range annihilation in the presence of a parity constraint. The probability for a pair-annihilation event decays as a power-law in the distance between particles, with a tunable exponent. Such long-range processes arise naturally in various classical settings, such as chemical reactions involving reagents with long-range electromagnetic interactions. They also increasingly play a role in the study of quantum dynamics, in which certain quantum protocols can be mapped to classical stochastic processes with long-range interactions: for example, state preparation or error correction processes aim to prepare ordered ground states, which requires removing point-like excitations in pairs via non-local feedback operations conditioned on a global set of measurement outcomes. We analytically and numerically describe features of absorbing phases and phase transitions in this family of classical models as pairwise annihilation is performed at larger and larger distances. Notably, we find that the two canonical absorbing-state universality classes -- directed-percolation and parity-conserving -- are endpoints of a line of universality classes with continuously interpolating critical exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum imaging-inspired setup for measuring gravitational fields using an atom that emits a photon at one of two possible locations. The atom acquires a gravitationally induced quantum phase that it shares with the photon. By restoring the path identity of the atom after its interaction with the gravitational field, the gravitationally induced phase can be measured using photon interferometry without the need for additional measurements on the atom. Through repeated measurements with varying interferometric setups, the gravitational potential and inertial acceleration can be deduced.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the spectrum of the hexagonal lattice graph with a vertex coupling which manifestly violates the time reversal invariance and at high energies it asymptotically decouples edges at even degree vertices; a comparison is made to the case when such a decoupling occurs at odd degree vertices. We also show that the spectral character does not change if the equilateral elementary cell of the lattice is dilated to have three different edge lengths, except that flat bands are absent if those are incommensurate.</description>

      <title>Better bounds on Grothendieck constants of finite orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck constants $K_G(d)$ bound the advantage of $d$-dimensional strategies over $1$-dimensional ones in a specific optimisation task. They have applications ranging from approximation algorithms to quantum nonlocality. However, apart from $d=2$, their values are unknown. Here, we exploit a recent Frank-Wolfe approach to provide good candidates for lower bounding some of these constants. The complete proof relies on solving difficult binary quadratic optimisation problems. For $d\in\{3,4,5\}$, we construct specific rectangular instances that we can solve to certify better bounds than those previously known; by monotonicity, our lower bounds improve on the state of the art for $d\leqslant9$. For $d\in\{4,7,8\}$, we exploit elegant structures to build highly symmetric instances achieving even greater bounds; however, we can only solve them heuristically. We also recall the standard relation with violations of Bell inequalities and elaborate on it to interpret generalised Grothendieck constants $K_G(d\mapsto2)$ as the advantage of complex quantum mechanics over real quantum mechanics. Motivated by this connection, we also improve the bounds on $K_G(d\mapsto2)$.</description>

      <title>Multi-party Semi-quantum Secret Sharing Protocol based on Measure-flip and Reflect Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-quantum secret sharing (SQSS) protocols serve as fundamental frameworks in quantum secure multi-party computations, offering the advantage of not requiring all users to possess intricate quantum devices. However, the current landscape of SQSS protocols predominantly caters to bipartite scenarios, rendering them inadequate for practical multi-party secret sharing requirements. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel SQSS protocol based on multi-particle GHZ states. In this protocol, the quantum user distributes predetermined secret information to multiple classical users with limited quantum capabilities, necessitating collaborative efforts among all classical users to reconstruct the correct secret information. By utilizing measure-flip and reflect operations, the transmitted multi-particle GHZ states can all contribute keys, thereby improving the utilization of transmitted particles. Security analysis shows that the protocol's resilience against prevalent external and internal threats. Additionally, employing IBM Qiskit, we conduct quantum circuit simulations to validate the protocol's accuracy and feasibility. Compared with similar studies, the proposed protocol has advantages in terms of protocol scalability, qubit efficiency, and shared message types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

Abstract: Transitions out of the ground space limit the performance of quantum adiabatic algorithms, while hardware imperfections impose stringent limitations on the circuit depth. We propose an adiabatic echo verification protocol which mitigates both coherent and incoherent errors, arising from non-adiabatic transitions and hardware noise, respectively. Quasi-adiabatically evolving forward and backwards allows for an echo-verified measurement of any observable. In addition to mitigating hardware noise, our method uses positive-time dynamics only. Crucially, the estimator bias of the observable is reduced when compared to standard adiabatic preparation, achieving up to a quadratic improvement.</description>

Abstract: Resource-efficient quantum state tomography is one of the key ingredients of future quantum technologies. In this work, we propose a new tomography protocol combining standard quantum state reconstruction methods with an attention-based neural network architecture. We show how the proposed protocol is able to improve the averaged fidelity reconstruction over linear inversion and maximum-likelihood estimation in the finite-statistics regime, reducing at least by an order of magnitude the amount of necessary training data. We demonstrate the potential use of our protocol in physically relevant scenarios, in particular, to certify metrological resources in the form of many-body entanglement generated during the spin squeezing protocols. This could be implemented with the current quantum simulator platforms, such as trapped ions, and ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocity in Photon Polarization based on direction of polarizer under Gravitational Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unification of gravity with quantum mechanics is still a terra incognita. Photon polarization measurements offer a unique window for probing the interaction between these two fundamental forces. We have revealed that non-reciprocity in the photon polarization angle can arise by tailoring the quantization axis, which corresponds to the direction of polarizer. Due to this non-reciprocity, the measured polarization angle can become ten times larger than that of gravitationally induced frame rotation in both near-Earth and black hole environments. To verify this finding, we propose an astronomical interferometer composed of satellites with the tailored quantization axis, challenging the conventional view of their triviality in closed paths of a photon. Notably, this non-reciprocity can extend to any rotation in the polarization plane, irrespective of the origins, all of which can dictate polarization rotation. Our findings could offer new opportunities for testing fundamental principles in physics.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic implementation of multipartite quantum channels and other quantum instruments using local operations and classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a necessary condition that a quantum channel on a multipartite system may be approximated arbitrarily closely using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then extend those arguments to obtain a condition that applies to all quantum instruments, which range from the most refined case, a generalized measurement, to the most coarse-grained, which is a quantum channel. We illustrate these results by a detailed analysis of a quantum instrument that is known not to be implementable by LOCC, but which can be arbitrarily closely approximated within that framework. As one outgrowth of this analysis, we find a quantum measurement that falls into the same category: it cannot be implemented exactly by LOCC, but can be approximated by LOCC arbitrarily closely. This measurement has an infinite number of outcomes, leaving open the question as to whether or not there exists a measurement within this same category but having only a finite number of outcomes.</description>

      <title>Towards a dissipative quantum classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel quantum classifier utilizing dissipative engineering. Unlike standard quantum circuit models, the classifier consists of a central spin-qubit model. By subjecting the auxiliary qubits to carefully tailored strong dissipations, we establish a one-to-one mapping between classical data and dissipative modes. This mapping enables the encoding of classical data within a decoherence-free subspace, where the central qubit undergoes evolution. The dynamics of the central qubit are governed by an effective Lindblad master equation, resulting in relaxation towards a steady state. We first demonstrate the capability of our model to prepare arbitrary single-qubit states by training the inter-coupling of the system and the external dissipations. By elucidating the underlying classification rule, we subsequently derive a quantum classifier. Leveraging a training set with labeled data, we train the dissipative central spin-qubit system to perform specific classification tasks akin to classical neural networks. Our study illuminates the untapped potential of the dissipative system for efficient and effective classification tasks in the realm of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard gate cannot be replaced by a resource state in universal quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03515v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models of quantum computation that involve operations performed on some fixed resourceful quantum state. Examples that fit this paradigm include magic state injection and measurement-based approaches. We introduce a framework that incorporates both of these cases and focus on the role of coherence (or superposition) in this context, as exemplified through the Hadamard gate. We prove that given access to incoherent unitaries (those that are unable to generate superposition from computational basis states, e.g. CNOT, diagonal gates), classical control, computational basis measurements, and any resourceful ancillary state (of arbitrary dimension), it is not possible to implement any coherent unitary (e.g. Hadamard) exactly with non-zero probability. We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds for the induced trace distance between the above operations and $n$ Hadamard gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a similar no-go result for the case of using $k$ Hadamard gates to exactly implement $n&gt;k$ Hadamard gates.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Kink Entanglement Asymmetry on a Quantum Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement and characterization of noise is a flourishing area of research in mesoscopic physics. In this work, we propose interaction-free measurements as a noise-detection technique, exploring two conceptually different schemes: the coherent and the projective realizations. These detectors consist of a qutrit whose second transition is resonantly coupled to an oscillatory field that may have noise in amplitude or phase. For comparison, we consider a more standard detector previously discussed in this context: a qubit coupled in a similar way to the noise source. We find that the qutrit scheme offers clear advantages, allowing precise detection and characterization of the noise, while the qubit does not. Finally, we study the signature of noise correlations in the detector's signal.</description>

      <title>Exact results on finite size corrections for surface codes tailored to biased noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The code-capacity threshold of a scalable quantum error correcting stabilizer code can be expressed as a thermodynamic phase transition of a corresponding random-bond Ising model. Here we study the XY and XZZX surface codes under phase-biased noise, $p_x=p_y=p_z/(2\eta)$, with $\eta\geq 1/2$, and total error rate $p=p_x+p_y+p_z$. By appropriately formulating the boundary conditions, in the rotated code geometry, we find exact solutions at a special disordered point, $p=\frac{1+\eta^{-1}}{2+\eta^{-1}}\gtrsim 0.5$, for arbitrary odd code distance $d$, where the codes reduce to one-dimensional Ising models. The total logical failure rate is given by $P_{f}=\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}e^{-2d_Z\,\text{artanh}(1/2\eta)}$, where $d_{Z}=d^2$ and $d$ for the two codes respectively, is the effective code distance for pure phase-flip noise. As a consequence, for code distances $d\ll \eta$, and error rates near the threshold, the XZZX code is effectively equivalent to the phase-flip correcting repetition code over $d$ qubits. The large finite size corrections for $d_Z&lt;\eta$ also make threshold extractions, from numerical calculations at moderate code distances, unreliable. We show that calculating thresholds based not only on the total logical failure rate, but also independently on the phase- and bit-flip logical failure rates, gives a more confident estimate. Using this method for the XZZX code with a tensor-network based decoder and code distances up to $d\approx 100$, we find that the thresholds converge to a single value at moderate bias ($\eta=30, 100$), at an error rate above the hashing bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study supersymmetry in quantum mechanics using the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), or in other words, generalized supersymmetry in quantum mechanics. We construct supersymmetry in the generalized form of the momentum operator, which is derived from GUP. By generalizing the creation and annihilation operators, we can transform the supersymmetry into a generalized state. In the following, we address the challenge of solving the Schr\"odinger equation for the generalized Hamiltonian. To overcome this difficulty, we employ perturbation theory to establish a relationship between the creation and annihilation operators. By solving this equation analytically and utilizing wave functions and energy levels, we can generate new potentials using the creation and annihilation operators of the wave functions and energy levels for the newer potentials.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of {\it quantum ratio} emerged in the recent efforts to understand how Newton's equations appear for the center of mass (CM) of an isolated macroscopic body at finite body-temperatures, as the first approximation to quantum-mechanical equations. It is defined as $Q\equiv R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases $R_q /L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum mechanics works in biological systems.</description>

With the help of Cannon's algorithm, the distributed computing transformation of numerical method for simulating quantum unitary evolution is achieved. Based on the Tavis-Cummings model, a large number of atoms are added into the optical cavity to obtain a high-dimensional quantum closed system, implemented on the supercomputer platform.

      <description>arXiv:2404.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent manipulation of quantum states of light is key to photonic quantum information processing. In this Letter, we show that a passive two-level nonlinearity suffices to implement non-Gaussian quantum operations on propagating field modes. In particular, the collective light-matter interaction can efficiently extract a single photon from a multi-photon input wave packet to an orthogonal temporal mode. We accurately describe the single-photon subtraction process by elements of an intuitive quantum-trajectory model. By employing this process, quantum information protocols gain orders of magnitude improved efficiency over heralded schemes with linear optics. The reverse process can be used to add photons one-by-one to a single wave-packet mode and compose arbitrarily large Fock states with a finite total success probability $&gt;96.7\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $1/2$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space $CP^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin j (a 2j+1 -state system) for generic j is represented instead by a point of a larger space, $CP^{2j}$. Here we study the angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The state, $(J \cdot n) | j, n\rangle = j |j, n \rangle $, where $J$ is the angular momentum operator and $n$ stands for a generic unit vector in $R^3$, is found to behave as a classical angular momentum, $ j n $. We discuss this phenomenon, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. This problem arose from the consideration of a macroscopic body under an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our observations help to explain how classical mechanics (with unique particle trajectories) emerges naturally from quantum mechanics in this context, and at the same time, make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, a more precise one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for multiphoton qubit-resonator interactions enhanced by a qubit drive. The interactions generate qubit-conditional operations in the resonator when the driving is near $n$-photon cross-resonance, namely, the qubit drive is $n$-times the resonator frequency. We pay special attention to the strong driving regime, where the interactions are conditioned on the qubit dressed states. We consider the specific case where $n=2$, which results in qubit-conditional squeezing (QCS). We show that the QCS protocol can be used to generate a superposition of orthogonally squeezed states following a properly chosen qubit measurement. We outline quantum information processing applications for these states, including encoding a qubit in a resonator via the superposition of orthogonally squeezed states. We show how the QCS operation can be used to realize a controlled-squeeze gate and its use in bosonic phase estimation. The QCS protocol can also be utilized to achieve faster unitary operator synthesis on the joint qubit-resonator Hilbert space. Next, we investigate the use of a two-tone drive to engineer an effective $n$-photon Rabi Hamiltonian with widely tunable effective system parameters, which could enable the realization of new regimes that have so far been inaccessible. Finally, we propose a multiphoton circuit QED implementation based on a transmon qubit coupled to a resonator via an asymmetric SQUID. We provide realistic parameter estimates for the two-photon operation regime that can host the aforementioned two-photon protocols. We use numerical simulations to show that even in the presence of spurious terms and decoherence, our analytical predictions are robust.</description>

Abstract: Negative probabilities arise primarily in physics, statistical quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Negative probabilities arise as mixing distributions of unobserved latent variables in Bayesian modeling. Our goal is to provide a link between these two viewpoints. Bartlett provides a definition of negative probabilities based on extraordinary random variables and properties of their characteristic function. A version of Bayes rule is given with negative mixing weights. The classic half coin distribution and Polya-Gamma mixing is discussed. Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty and the duality of scale mixtures of Normals is also discussed. A number of examples of dual densities with negative mixing measures are provided including the Linnik and Wigner distributions. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Quantum encoder for fixed Hamming-weight subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact $n$-qubit computational-basis amplitude encoder of real- or complex-valued data vectors of $d=\binom{n}{k}$ components into a subspace of fixed Hamming weight $k$. This represents a polynomial space compression. The circuit is optimal in that it expresses an arbitrary data vector using only $d-1$ (controlled) Reconfigurable Beam Splitter (RBS) gates and is constructed by an efficient classical algorithm that sequentially generates all bitstrings of weight $k$ and identifies all gate parameters. An explicit compilation into CNOTs and single-qubit gates is presented, with the total CNOT-gate count of $\mathcal{O}(k\, d)$ provided in analytical form. In addition, we show how to load data in the binary basis by sequentially stacking encoders of different Hamming weights using $\mathcal{O}(d\,\log(d))$ CNOT gates. Moreover, using generalized RBS gates that mix states of different Hamming weights, we extend the construction to efficiently encode arbitrary sparse vectors. Finally, we perform an experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of our scheme on a commercial trapped-ion quantum computer. We successfully upload a $q$-Gaussian probability distribution in the non-log-concave regime with $n = 6$ and $k = 2$. We also showcase how the effect of hardware noise can be alleviated by quantum error mitigation. Our results constitute a versatile framework for quantum data compression with various potential applications in fields such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, and constrained combinatorial optimizations.</description>

      <title>Gate-based counterdiabatic driving with complexity guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general, fully gate-based quantum algorithm for counterdiabatic driving. The algorithm does not depend on heuristics as in previous variational methods, and exploits regularisation of the adiabatic gauge potential to suppress only the transitions from the eigenstate of interest. This allows for a rigorous quantum gate complexity upper bound in terms of the minimum gap $\Delta$ around this eigenstate. We find that, in the worst case, the algorithm requires at most $\tilde O(\Delta^{-(3 + o(1))} \epsilon^{-(1 + o(1))})$ quantum gates to achieve a target state fidelity of at least $1 - \epsilon^2$, where $\Delta$ is the minimum spectral gap. In certain cases, the gap dependence can be improved to quadratic.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum computing approaches for Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator on classical hardware for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal ansatz circuit depths of 65 and 424 layers, respectively, and for the molecule LiH with a maximal ansatz circuit depth of 81 layers. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Improve Variational Quantum Eigensolver by Many-Body Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have been widely demonstrated in both experimental and theoretical contexts to have extensive applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. However, the exponential growth in the dimension of the Hilbert space results in the phenomenon of vanishing parameter gradients in the circuit as the number of qubits and circuit depth increase, known as the barren plateau phenomena. In recent years, research in non-equilibrium statistical physics has led to the discovery of the realization of many-body localization. As a type of floquet system, many-body localized floquet system has phase avoiding thermalization with an extensive parameter space coverage and have been experimentally demonstrated can produce time crystals. We applied this circuit to the variational quantum algorithms for the calculation of many-body ground states and studied the variance of gradient for parameter updates under this circuit. We found that this circuit structure can effectively avoid barren plateaus. We also analyzed the entropy growth, information scrambling, and optimizer dynamics of this circuit. Leveraging this characteristic, we designed a new type of variational ansatz, called the 'many-body localization ansatz'. We applied it to solve quantum many-body ground states and examined its circuit properties. Our numerical results show that our ansatz significantly improved the variational quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Diagonalization of large many-body Hamiltonians on a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of low energies of many-body systems is a cornerstone of computational quantum sciences. Variational quantum algorithms can be used to prepare ground states on pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, but their lack of convergence guarantees and impractical number of cost function estimations prevent systematic scaling of experiments to large systems. Alternatives to variational approaches are needed for large-scale experiments on pre-fault-tolerant devices. Here, we use a superconducting quantum processor to compute eigenenergies of quantum many-body systems on two-dimensional lattices of up to 56 sites, using the Krylov quantum diagonalization algorithm, an analog of the well-known classical diagonalization technique. We construct subspaces of the many-body Hilbert space using Trotterized unitary evolutions executed on the quantum processor, and classically diagonalize many-body interacting Hamiltonians within those subspaces. These experiments show that quantum diagonalization algorithms are poised to complement their classical counterpart at the foundation of computational methods for quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Randomness versus Nonlocality in Multi-input and Multi-output Quantum Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent randomness certification based on Bell nonlocality does not require any assumptions about the devices and therefore provides adequate security. Great effort has been made to demonstrate that nonlocality is necessary for generating quantum randomness, but the minimal resource required for random number generation has not been clarified. Here we first prove and experimentally demonstrate that violating any two-input Bell inequality is both necessary and sufficient for certifying randomness, however, for the multi-input cases, this sufficiency ceases to apply, leading to certain states exhibiting Bell nonlocality without the capability to certify randomness. We examine two typical classes of Bell inequalities with multi-input and multi-output, the facet inequalities and Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Ac\'in-Pironio Bell inequalities, in the high-dimensional photonic system, and observe the violation of the latter one can always certify randomness which is not true for the former. The private randomness with a generation rate of 1.867\pm0.018 bits per photon pair is obtained in the scenario of Salavrakos-Augusiak-Tura-Wittek-Ac\'in-Pironio Bell inequalities with 3-input and 4-output. Our work unravels the internal connection between randomness and nonlocality, and effectively enhances the performance of tasks such as device-independent random number generation.</description>

      <title>Non-Iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster based on Lie-algebraic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to their non-iterative nature, fixed Unitary Coupled-Cluster (UCC) ans\"atze are attractive for performing quantum chemistry Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) computations as they avoid pre-circuit measurements on a quantum computer. However, achieving chemical accuracy for strongly correlated systems with UCC requires further inclusion of higher-order fermionic excitations beyond triples increasing circuit depth. We introduce $k$-NI-DUCC, a fixed and Non-iterative Disentangled Unitary Coupled-Cluster compact ansatz, based on specific $"k"$ sets of "qubit" excitations, eliminating the needs for fermionic-type excitations. These elements scale linearly ($\mathcal{O}(n)$) by leveraging Lie algebraic structures, with $n$ being the number of qubits. The key excitations are screened through specific selection criteria, including the enforcement of all symmetries, to ensure the construction of a robust set of generators. NI-DUCC employs $"k"$ products of the exponential of $\mathcal{O}(n)$- anti-Hermitian Pauli operators, where each operator has a length $p$. This results in a fewer two-qubit CNOT gates circuit, $\mathcal{O}(knp)$, suitable for hardware implementations. Tested on LiH, H$_6$ and BeH$_2$, NI-DUCC-VQE achieves both chemical accuracy and rapid convergence even for molecules deviating significantly from equilibrium. It is hardware-efficient, reaching the exact Full Configuration Interaction energy solution at specific layers, while reducing significantly the VQE optimization steps. While NI-DUCC-VQE effectively addresses the gradient measurement bottleneck of ADAPT-VQE-like iterative algorithms, the classical computational cost of constructing the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ set of excitations increases exponentially with the number of qubits. We provide a first implementation for constructing the generators' set able to handle up to 20 qubits and discuss the efficiency perspectives.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Shortest Vector Problems with Folded Spectrum Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing has been recently studied to solve the shortest vector problem (SVP), where the norm of a lattice point vector is mapped to the problem Hamiltonian with the qudit encoding, Hamming-weight encoding, or binary encoding, and the problem to find the shortest vector is mapped to a problem to find a non-trivial first excited state. We here propose an alternative encoding and alternative quantum algorithm to solve the SVP: the one-hot encoding and the quantum imaginary-time algorithm with the folded spectrum (FS) method. We demonstrate that our approach is applicable to find the shortest vector with a variational quantum algorithm. The application of the FS method to the quantum annealing and simulated annealing is also discussed to solve the SVP. Our study shows wide potential applicability of the SVP in quantum computing frameworks.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the restricted Hilbert space of Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Q-Seg: Quantum Annealing-Based Unsupervised Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Q-Seg, a novel unsupervised image segmentation method based on quantum annealing, tailored for existing quantum hardware. We formulate the pixel-wise segmentation problem, which assimilates spectral and spatial information of the image, as a graph-cut optimization task. Our method efficiently leverages the interconnected qubit topology of the D-Wave Advantage device, offering superior scalability over existing quantum approaches and outperforming several tested state-of-the-art classical methods. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets have shown that Q-Seg has better runtime performance than the state-of-the-art classical optimizer Gurobi. The method has also been tested on earth observation image segmentation, a critical area with noisy and unreliable annotations. In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum, Q-Seg emerges as a reliable contender for real-world applications in comparison to advanced techniques like Segment Anything. Consequently, Q-Seg offers a promising solution using available quantum hardware, especially in situations constrained by limited labeled data and the need for efficient computational runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference Experiment in Optical Fiber for the Undergraduate Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a quantum optics laboratory experiment that has recently become more accessible to undergraduate students. The experiment consists of two identical photons simultaneously entering a non-polarizing beam splitter. The wavefunctions destructively interfere and the photon pairs bunch (both exit the same output) at the outputs whereas classically they are equally likely to exit different outputs. Due to the precision needed to achieve indistinguishability, setup and alignment of this experiment is often considered to be too difficult and time consuming to be appropriate for an undergraduate lab, with an end goal of merely demonstrating the HOM interference dip. Here, we present an alternative optical fiber-based apparatus that gives a consistently reproducible experiment with interference occurring in a fused-fiber coupler instead of a traditional beam splitter. We use a commercially available fiber coupled biphoton source that requires minimal alignment and increases coherence length of the interference. In addition, our biphoton source provides direct temperature based control of the frequency degeneracy of the photon pairs produced, allowing for students to investigate physical properties of HOM interference such as coherence length and interference visibility. Through use of standard opto-mechanical parts combined with the commercially available fiber integrated biphoton source and laser, our apparatus is a middle ground between built-from-scratch and pre-aligned setups.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic but commensurate hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with an additional onsite staggered imaginary potential. Such dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain, more so with the periodic hopping distribution. Generally a weak potential can respect the parity-time (PT ) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, while a strong potential breaks PT conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. We find that this PT breaking with imaginary potential strength \gamma show interesting dependence on the hopping modulation \Delta for different hoping modulations. In-gap states, that appear also in the \gamma = 0 limit, take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strength of both \gamma and \Delta. The localization of end states (in-gap states) at the boundaries are investigated which show extended nature not only near topological transitions (further away from |\Delta/t| = 1) but also near the unmodulated limit of \Delta = 0. Moreover, localization of the bulk states is observed at the maximally dimerized limit of |\Delta/t| = 1, which also have a {\gamma} dependence. Analyzing further the dissipation caused by the complex eigenvalues in this problem with different hopping periodicity can be essential in modulating the gain-loss contrast in optical systems or in designing various quantum information processing and storage devices.</description>

Abstract: We construct the primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of the 108-element $\Sigma(36\times3)$ group. This is the first time a nonabelian crystal-like subgroup of $SU(3)$ has been constructed for quantum simulation. The gauge link registers and necessary primitives -- the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the $\Sigma(36\times3)$ Fourier transform -- are presented for both an eight-qubit encoding and a heterogeneous three-qutrit plus two-qubit register. For the latter, a specialized compiler was developed for decomposing arbitrary unitaries onto this architecture.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems as an Effective Collapse Theory</title>

Abstract: It is shown that, in the non-relativistic limit, causal fermion systems give rise to an effective collapse theory. The nonlinear and stochastic correction terms to the Schr\"odinger equation are derived from the causal action principle. The dynamics of the statistical operator is described by a deterministic equation of Kossakowski-Lindblad form. Moreover, the quantum state undergoes a dynamical collapse compatible with the Born rule. The effective model has similarities with the continuous spontaneous localization model, but differs from it by a conservation law for the probability integral as well as a non-locality in time on a microscopic length scale $\ell_{\min}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics of integrable quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

      <title>Landauer's principle and black hole area quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau\mathcal{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>
