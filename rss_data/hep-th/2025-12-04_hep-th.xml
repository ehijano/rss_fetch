      <title>Topological Einstein gravity as Kodaira-Spencer gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a contribution towards quantizing three-dimensional gravity, we show at the classical level that Euclidean three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant is uplifted to the $SU(2)$-invariant sector of Kodaira-Spencer gravity on a Calabi-Yau three-fold. Kodaira-Spencer gravity appears in the target space description of the B-model topological string theory and describes deformations of a complex structure. We prove that given a reference solution of Einstein gravity in the first-order formulation, a second off-shell configuration uplifts to a unique complex structure deformation in six dimensions. If the configuration satisfies Einstein's equations, the complex structure deformation is integrable, i.e. a solution of Kodaira-Spencer gravity. We demonstrate the uplift explicitly for Ba\~nados solutions. Our construction embeds three-dimensional gravity into topological string theory and AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality into twisted holography.</description>

      <title>Homotopy transfer for massive Kaluza-Klein modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop techniques to treat massive Kaluza-Klein modes to arbitrary order in perturbation theory. The Higgs mechanism that renders the higher Kaluza-Klein modes massive is displayed. To this end we give an algorithm in perturbation theory that yields new fields with the following characteristics: they are gauge invariant under all higher-mode gauge transformations, which are broken, but they transform covariantly under the zero-mode gauge transformations, which are unbroken. We employ the formulation of field theory in terms of $L_{\infty}$ algebras together with their homotopy transfer, which here maps the gauge redundant fields of gravity to gauge invariant fields. We illustrate these results, as a proof of concept, for Kaluza-Klein theory on a torus. In an accompanying paper these results will be applied to a large class of generalized Scherk-Schwarz backgrounds in exceptional field theory.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Saddle in Euclidean IKKT Matrix Model and Its Effective Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equation of motion of the Euclidean IKKT matrix model, and realize a new type of classical saddle that only exists in $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Under the assumption that the matrices are the generators of $\mathfrak{so}(n,m)$, we identify a unique solution, that is, $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Even though it has $6$ generators and thus $6$ non-zero matrices, they are not independent due to the $2$ Casimir constraints in $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure and the Casimir constraints, we derive the effective metric that a test probe propagates on. The resulting effective metric exhibits an $SO(3)$ symmetry, matching the spatial symmetry of our universe.</description>

      <title>Matrix Quantum Mechanics and Entanglement Entropy: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review aspects of entanglement entropy in the quantum mechanics of $N\times N$ matrices, i.e. matrix quantum mechanics (MQM), at large $N$. In doing so we review standard models of MQM and their relation to string theory, D-brane physics, and emergent non-commutative geometries. We overview, in generality, definitions of subsystems and entanglement entropies in theories with gauge redundancy and discuss the additional structure required for definining subsystems in MQMs possessing a $U(N)$ gauge redundancy. In connecting these subsystems to non-commutative geometry, we review several works on `target space entanglement,' and entanglement in non-commutative field theories, highlighting the conditions in which target space entanglement entropy displays an `area law' at large $N$. We summarize several example calculations of entanglement entropy in non-commutative geometries and MQMs. We review recent work in connecting the area law entanglement of MQM to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, highlighting the conditions in which $U(N)$ invariance implies a minimal area formula for the entanglement entropy at large $N$. Finally, we make comments on open questions and research directions.</description>

      <title>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</description>

      <title>(Anti)-de Sitter with leaky boundaries and corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct charges for four-dimensional spacetimes with a non-vanishing cosmological constant, including charges that are not conserved because of a leaky boundary and charges associated with corner terms in the symplectic current. The construction leads to manifestly finite charges for any choice of boundary conditions, and reveals new charges in partial Bondi gauge for an enlarged class of field configurations which are not fully on-shell, including a Weyl charge for conformal boundary conditions. In addition, we generalize the variational principle for AdS$_4$ gravity with Dirichlet boundary conditions to a wedge of spacetime where the conformal boundary includes a corner. The boundary data is completely general, with no conditions restricting time dependence or the determinant of the metric. The Ward identities associated with boundary diffeomorphisms are shown to reproduce the evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum of fully on-shell field configurations.</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro Crossing Kernels at Rational Central Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report novel analytic results for the Virasoro modular and fusion kernels relevant to 2d conformal field theories (CFTs), 3d topological field theories (TQFTs), and the representation theory of certain quantum groups. For all rational values of the parameter $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ -- corresponding in 2d CFT to all rational central charge values in the domain $(-\infty,1]\cup[25,\infty)$ -- we establish two main results. First, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{[25,\infty)}$ we show that the modular and fusion kernels derived by Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov respectively can be expressed as a linear combination of two functions, which (i) are themselves admissible crossing kernels, (ii) have square-root branch point singularities in the Liouville momenta, (iii) are not reflection-symmetric in the Liouville momenta. These features illustrate that the space of solutions to the basic shift relations determining these kernels is broader than previously assumed. Second, in the domain $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ we derive for the first time the physical modular and fusion kernels for generic values of the Liouville momenta. These can again be written as a linear combination of two other admissible kernels but overall, and unlike the Teschner and Teschner-Vartanov solutions for $c\geq 25$, they possess square-root branch point singularities. As a corollary, we demonstrate that timelike Liouville theory at $c\in\mathbb{Q}_{(-\infty,1]}$ is crossing symmetric and modular covariant. Surprisingly, the crossing kernels at any $b^2\in\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ behave as if they were semiclassical and one-loop exact, and we discuss the interpretation of this fact in the context of the 2d conformal bootstrap and the 3d TQFT that captures pure 3d gravity with negative cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Generalized Yang-Mills theory: Interpolating between SDYM and YM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generalized Yang-Mills (YM) theory with two real couplings, interpolating continuously between the Self-Dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) limit (also called Chalmers-Siegel theory) and physical Yang-Mills theory. The kinetic coupling $\epsilon$ controls local fluctuations and anti-instanton weight, while the topological coupling $g$ controls the instanton weight. Both couplings are asymptotically free. We derive an exact all-order relation between the beta functions of the two couplings, revealing a Renormalization Group invariant, a new dimensionless expansion parameter $\Lambda_\epsilon / \Lambda_g$ into the study of YM theory. In the SDYM limit, the vacuum is populated by a finite density of topological defects, yet local correlators decay algebraically, consistent with a non-unitary conformal field theory. We confirm this mechanism via compactification on arbitrary size $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, where the vacuum maps to a non-interacting ideal gas of monopole-instantons. As the kinetic coupling is turned on, a mass gap and confinement scale emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a careful study of the chiral symmetry breaking minima and other potential minima in supersymmetric symplectic QCD ($Sp(N_c)$ with $N_f$ flavors) perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). Although the case of $N_f = N_c +1$ requires particular care due to the inherently strongly coupled nature of the quantum modified moduli space, we are able to show that all $Sp(N_c)$ theories to which AMSB can be applied ($N_f &lt; 3(N_c + 1)$) possess stable chiral symmetry breaking minima, which are plausibly continuously connected to the vacua of QCD-like $Sp(N_c)$ theories for large SUSY breaking, and are protected from runaways to incalculable minima.</description>

      <title>From AdS correlators to Carrollian amplitudes with the scattering equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering equations relate massless scattering kinematics to marked points on a Riemann sphere, and underpin remarkable formulae for the full tree-level S-matrices of many interesting QFTs, including cubic biadjoint scalars, Yang-Mills theory and general relativity. The scattering equations arise from worldsheet correlators of ambitwistor string theories, which has enabled their generalisation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in certain cases. In this paper, we use the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings to prove the correspondence between an appropriate flat limit of boundary correlators in AdS and Carrollian scattering amplitudes -- massless amplitudes written in position space on the null conformal boundary -- for any number of external states and spacetime dimensions in tree-level, cubic scalar theories. We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators. We then take the flat limit of known formulae for all tree-level boundary correlators of cubic scalar theories in AdS, recovering the Carrollian amplitudes in flat space. In the special case of AdS$_3$, we also make some comments on the flat space limit of spinning boundary correlators.</description>

      <title>Functorial properties of Schwinger-DeWitt expansion and Mellin-Barnes representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider integral kernels for functions $f(\hat F)$ of a minimal second-order differential operator $\hat F(\nabla)$ on a curved spacetime. We show that they can be expanded in a functional series, analogous to the DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel, by integrating the latter term-by-term. This procedure leads to a separation of two types of data: all information about the bundle geometry and the operator $\hat F(\nabla)$ is still contained in the standard HaMiDeW coefficients $\hat a_k[F | x,x']$ (we call this property ``off-diagonal functoriality''), while information about the function $f$ is encoded in some new scalar functions $\mathbb{B}_\alpha[f | \sigma]$ and $\mathbb{W}_\alpha[f | \sigma, m^2]$, which we call basis and complete massive kernels, respectively. These objects are calculated for operator functions of the form $\exp(-\tau\hat F^\nu)/(\hat F^\mu + \lambda)$ as multiple Mellin--Barnes integrals. The article also discusses subtle issues such as the validity of the term-by-term integration, the regularization of IR divergent integrals, and the physical interpretation of the resulting expansions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love Numbers for Black Holes and Beyond from Shell Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a novel effective field theory for a compact body coupled to gravity, whose key feature is that the dynamics of gravitational perturbations is explicitly determined by known solutions in black hole perturbation theory in four dimensions. In this way, the physics of gravitational perturbations in curved space are already encoded in the effective field theory, thus bypassing the need for the higher-order calculations that constitute a major hurdle in standard approaches. Concretely, we model the compact body as a spherical shell, whose finite size regulates short-distance divergences in four dimensions and whose tidal responses are described by higher-dimensional operators. As an application, we consider scalar perturbations and derive new results for scalar Love numbers through ${\cal O} (G^9)$ for Schwarzschild black holes and for generic compact bodies. Finally, our analysis reveals an intriguing structure of the scalar black-hole Love numbers in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which we conjecture to hold to all orders.</description>

      <title>Extremal couplings and gluon scattering in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider M-theory on the backgrounds AdS$_4\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{N_f}$ and AdS$_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$, which have fixed point locii AdS$_{d+1}\times S^3$ for $d=3,6$. These theories are holographically dual to certain CFTs in $d=3,6$ with eight supercharges. We compute the bulk cubic couplings between graviton KK modes and gluon KK modes living on the fixed points of these theories, which are generically extremal. We use these couplings to compute the graviton exchange term that appears in the strong coupling expansion of holographic correlators of gluon KK modes $\langle 22pp\rangle$ in these theories, and check that it matches the expected flat space limit. We express the answer in terms of a new reduced correlator solution to the superconformal Ward identities, which we derive for all CFTs with eight supercharges in $3\leq d\leq6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of N=1 SUSY gauge theories with matter in adjoint and fundamental representations and the superpotentials given by Arnold's ADE singularities has been extensively studied in the literature. It was also conjectured that supersymmetric models with $W_{A_k}$, $W_{D_{k+2}}$ and $W_{E_7}$ superpotentials possess a dual description. In this paper we revisit the analysis of the moduli space of $A_k$ and $D_{k+2}$ models by considering the duality along nilpotent directions on the moduli space. While our analysis provides additional evidence for the duality conjecture in $W_{A_k}$ models, we show that the duality conjecture fails for the $W_{D_{k+2}}$ models.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the different scaling regimes of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang--Burgers equation using the functional renormalisation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03937v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation featuring non-equilibrium scaling. Although in one dimension, its statistical properties are very well understood, a new scaling regime has been reported in recent numerical simulations. This new regime is characterised by a dynamical exponent $z=1$, markedly different from the expected one $z=3/2$ for the KPZ universality class, and it emerges when approaching the inviscid limit. The origin of this scaling has been traced down to the existence of a new fixed point, termed the inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point, which was uncovered using the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The FRG equations can be solved analytically in the asymptotic regime of vanishing viscosity and large momenta, showing that indeed $z=1$ exactly at the IB fixed point. In this work, we set up an advanced method to numerically solve the full FRG flow equations in a certain approximation, which allows us to determine in a unified way the correlation function over the whole range of momenta, not restricted to some particular regime. We analyse the crossover between the different fixed points, and quantitatively determine the extent of the IB regime.</description>

      <title>Tau--Function Multilinear Hierarchy of the Tomimatsu--Sato Spacetime: A Gravitational Realization of the YTSF Integrable Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tomimatsu--Sato (TS) family generalizes the Kerr black hole to higher multipole order $\delta$ and has long been regarded as algebraically complicated without any clear integrability. We show instead that stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations, when the Ernst potential is written as a $\tau$--ratio $\mathcal{E}=\tau_1/\tau_0$, admit a universal decomposition of the Ernst numerator into a cubic part containing all second derivatives and a quartic \emph{gradient envelope}. The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $\delta=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel. Thus the TS geometry forms a gravitational realization of a multilinear $\tau$--function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity.</description>

      <title>From scalar clouds around evaporating black holes to boson star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the evolution of a scalar cloud bound to an evaporating black hole. Our simulations of the associated Schr\"odinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.</description>

      <title>Novel phases in the Fe-Si-O system at terapascal pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fe-Si-O ternary system, central to modeling the interiors of terrestrial planets, remains poorly constrained at Terapascal (TPa) pressures characteristic of super-Earth mantles. Using a combination of crystal-structure prediction and ab initio calculations, we identify three ternary compounds stable near 1 TPa: P3 FeSiO4, P3 Fe4Si5O18, and P-3 FeSi2O6. The first two phases are thermodynamically stable at low temperatures, whereas P-3 FeSi2O6 becomes favored above approximately 2000 K. All three are metallic, paramagnetic, and adopt pseudo-binary arrangements derived from the FeO2 and SiO2 end-member structures. Their crystal structures emerge through substitutions of Fe for Si in Fe2P-type SiO2 or of Si for Fe in Pnma-type FeO2, the stable elemental oxides at ~1 TPa. This structural continuity suggests that Fe preferentially substitutes for Si in the canonical Mg-silicates expected at TPa pressures. Notably, these new pseudo-binaries accommodate Fe in six- and nine-fold coordination, in contrast to the eight-fold cubic coordination found in FeO at similar pressures. The thermodynamic conditions under which these phases form from FeO2 and SiO2 mixtures are clarified through quasi-harmonic free energy calculations. Their prevalence in super-Earth's mantles is found to depend on the abundance of FeO2, which may be generated by the dehydrogenation of FeOOH goethite as in the Earth's deep mantle. The existence of these phases implies a markedly different pattern of Fe incorporation in high-pressure Mg-silicates at TPa pressures, compared with the behavior inferred at the GPa pressures of the Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>EFT of Dark Energy with Cosmic Chronometers: Reconstructing Background EFT Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a model-independent framework for studying cosmology within scalar-tensor theories. In this work, we explore how the time evolution of the cosmological background, inferred from cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter, can be used to reconstruct the relevant EFT functions. Our approach enables the direct determination of these EFT functions from observational data without assuming any specific cosmological model. This makes it possible to test the background evolution of a wide range of dark energy models, including the $\Lambda$CDM model. We further demonstrate how the reconstructed EFT functions can be applied to constrain concrete theories, such as the quintessence model.</description>

      <title>Multi-probe analysis of strong-field effects in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Decays of Secluded Scalars and Graviton Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss graviton dark radiation produced by the decay of a secluded scalar field that couples to the Standard Model (SM) only through gravity. Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</description>

      <title>Spherical accretion onto higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain relativistic solutions of spherically symmetric accretion by a dynamical analysis of a generalised Hamiltonian for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) Black Hole (BH). We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D&gt;4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of kinematic constraints and event selection on the emergence of the alignment phenomenon observed in cosmic-ray experiments is studied within the HYDJET++ model. It is demonstrated that the high degree of alignment, previously identified for realistic values of the transverse momentum disbalance of the most energetic particles, is also observed at the level of the most energetic clusters. In high-multiplicity events, the clustering procedure plays a crucial role in resolving individual particle groups on the detection plane, allowing a more accurate characterization of alignment patterns. These results highlight the combined effects of cluster formation and momentum conservation in shaping the observed azimuthal correlations.</description>

      <title>Some perspective of thermodynamical and optical properties of black holes in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the massive parameters ($\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($\alpha$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($\eta_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beth--Uhlenbeck entropy formula from the $\Phi-$derivable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the entropy of a dense fermion system with strong two-particle correlations, including scattering states and bound states. We work within the $\Phi-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to na\"{i}ve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a "squared Lorentzian" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $\Phi$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $\Phi$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Birefringence in a de Sitter Background with Chern-Simons Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Primary gravitational waves at high frequencies I: Origin of suppression in the power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The primary gravitational waves (PGWs) are generated in the early universe from the quantum vacuum during inflation. In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of shear viscosity on the propagation of primordial gravitational waves (pGW) after inflation. Without assuming a specific inflationary scenario we focus on the evolution of pGWs after they re-enter the horizon during a cosmological epoch characterized by the presence of shear viscosity. We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $\Omega_\text{GW}\sim k^{n_\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>New insights into two-loop running in effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, by viewing a 4D effective-field theory as the infrared (IR) limit of the compactified version in 5D, we can compute two-loop anomalous dimensions without gauge-breaking counter-terms, IR re-arrangement or geometric methods. The ultraviolet (UV) divergences in 4D are read from the IR ones in the matching from 5D to 4D. We use this approach to cross-check recent results in the literature, as well as to compute novel two-loop anomalous dimensions in the SMEFT to dimension eight and certain critical exponents in the charged fixed point of the Abelian Higgs model at large number of flavors.</description>

      <title>On the angular momentum and free energy of rotating gluon plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the free energy and the angular momentum of rotating hot gluon matter using first-principle numerical simulations of the $\textrm{SU}(3)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory. We calculate the specific moment of inertia and the specific deformation of the gluon matter as, respectively, the leading and next-to-leading terms in a series in angular velocity over a broad range of temperatures and various spatial boundary conditions. We show that the specific deformation, similarly to the moment of inertia, takes negative values in a phenomenologically interesting region of temperatures above the phase transition and turns positive at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Screening of dipolar emission in two-scale Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Trivalent Feynman Diagrams as a Flag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By identifying each standard flag with a trivalent Feynman diagram, the corresponding propagators can be read directly from the flag itself. Within the flag representation, the kinematic Jacobi identity (equivalently, the residue theorem on moduli spaces) admits a natural interpretation as the equivalence between a complete flag and its gapped counterpart. Using flags together with Orlik-Solomon algebras, we reconstruct the intersection numbers of twisted cocycles, thereby obtaining the bi-adjoint amplitude. Moreover, employing flag simplices enables the construction of the Z-amplitude in the alpha' -&gt; 0 limit. By further examining pairings of specific flags, we also recover the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) representation of the bi-adjoint amplitude.</description>

Abstract: We consider mixed strong-electroweak corrections to Higgs production via gluon fusion, in which the Higgs boson couples to the top quark. Using the method of differential equations, we compute all of the master integrals that contribute to this process at two loops through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon = (d-4)/2$, keeping full analytic dependence on the top quark, Higgs, W, and Z boson masses. We present the results for these master integrals in terms of iterated integrals whose kernels depend on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Light dilaton near critical points in top-down holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of UV-complete, strongly coupled, confining three-dimensional field theories, that exhibit a novel stabilisation mechanism for the mass of the lightest scalar composite state, relying on the existence of a critical point. The theories admit a holographic dual description in terms of regular backgrounds in eleven-dimensional supergravity. Their phase diagram includes a line of first-order phase transitions ending at the critical point, where the transition becomes of second order. We calculate the mass spectrum of bound states of the field theory, by considering fluctuations around the background solutions, and find that, near the critical point, a hierarchy of scales develops, such that one state becomes parametrically light. We identify this state as the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of approximate scale invariance. This stabilisation mechanism might be exploited to address hierarchy problems in particle and astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Unified equation for massless spin fields and new definitions of key spin coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals or exploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves, black hole perturbation theory proves indispensable. At the heart of developing a universal perturbation framework for such problems lies the challenge of formulating a coordinate-independent, unified wave equation that is universally applicable to any black hole spacetime. This paper resolves this central issue in type-D spacetimes by establishing a new definition of spin coefficients. Specifically, we introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\rho$, $\mu$, $\tau$, and $\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of the logarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\mu}$, $n^{\mu}$, $m^{\mu}$, $\bar{m}^{\mu}$), respectively. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. Using the newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary type-D black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This finding is particularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is already a significant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate spacetime around black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new definition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the unified equation for nearly all known type-D black hole backgrounds. This lays a solid foundation not only for studying gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals but also for exploring the analogy between massless spin-particle waves in any type-D black hole background.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type) Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model that shows the linear dependence of the entropy density on the temperature. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a renormalization group (RG) flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry by interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring realizing the generalized symmetry of an ultraviolet (UV) theory plays a fundamental role in determining condensation rules between anyons, resulting in the infrared (IR) theories. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>An emergent higher-form symmetry from type IIB superstring theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a higher-form symmetry in type IIB superstring theory, which possesses an ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. From the point of view of the low-energy effective field theory, the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is treated as a gauge symmetry. Hence, an $8$-form global symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ emerges as a quantum symmetry. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of the topological operator associated with the $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ symmetry. In this construction, the discriminant $\Delta(\tau)$ plays a central role. As a result, it becomes manifest that $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ is the solitonic symmetry of $7$-branes. Furthermore, taking into account the extensions of the duality group, we also discuss what global symmetries emerge when considering not ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ but ${\rm Mp}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and ${\rm Pin}^+({\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}))={\rm GL}^+(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

Abstract: We study the one-loop renormalization of self-interacting massless fields in the $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$ representation of the Restricted Lorentz Group. We work with a general model that represents the entire class of parity-invariant self-interacting massless theories that can be defined in this representation. It consists of a general free Lagrangian that reproduces the massless limit of three theories previously studied in the literature: the Joos-Weinberg, the Shay-Good/Hammer-McDonald-Pursey, and the Klein-Gordon-like one, as particular cases; along with an interacting Lagrangian containing all the independent dimension-4 parity-invariant self-interactions available in this representation. The model is found to be renormalizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the supergravity limit of AdS/CFT has been extensively explored, the regime in which stringy dynamics dominate, characterized by the emergence of an infinite tower of higher-spin massive modes, is far less understood. In this work, we leverage techniques from algebraic quantum field theory to investigate the extent to which hallmark features of bulk gravity survive at finite string tension and the emergence of intrinsically stringy phenomena. Working in the $g_s\rightarrow 0$ limit, we model excited string modes as free particles and demonstrate that the resulting Hagedorn spectrum leads to the breakdown of the split property, a strengthening of the locality principle, for regions that are within a string length of each other. We propose that this leads to a precise algebraic definition of stretched horizons and stretched quantum extremal surfaces. When stretched horizons exist, there is an associated nontrivial horizon $\star$-algebra. Furthermore, applying the algebraic ER=EPR proposal leads to the emergence of type III von Neumann factors, which provide an intriguing characterization of how such regions can have a quantum Einstein-Rosen bridge even if they are geometrically disjoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A four-dimensional gauge--gravity unification based on the local $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry is developed in a universal Yang--Mills-type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields, and their invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model-type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ down to $SL(2,\mathbb{C})\times SU(N)$, effectively filtering out unobserved non-compact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector for all gauge fields involved, while an Einstein--Cartan linear-curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. The matter sector points to a deeper elementarity of $SL(2N,\mathbb{C})$ spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $SL(16,\mathbb{C})$, accommodating precisely three composite quark--lepton families. The theory thus links non-compact unification, induced gravity, and fermion family structure within a single framework.</description>

      <title>Perturbative corrections to soft photon theorems for massless scalar QED in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perturbative corrections to soft photon theorems with massive scalars in de Sitter spacetime were computed in [JHEP10(2023)055]. However, the massless limit of the scalar modes is ill-defined in their work. It therefore is ambiguous to take the massless limit of the soft factors. In this paper, we derive the massless scalar modes in $d$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and use it to compute the perturbative corrections to the leading and sub-leading soft photon theorems. Our framework corresponds to tree level scattering of massless scalars followed by an emission of a soft photon in a compact region of the static patch of de Sitter. We show that our results are consistent with [JHEP10(2023)055] in the massless limit and we comment on the universality of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07049v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <title>Barrow Cosmology and Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using thermodynamics-gravity conjecture, we present the formal derivation of the modified Friedmann equations inspired by the Barrow entropy, $S\sim A ^{1+\delta/2}$, where $0\leq\delta\leq 1$ is the Barrow exponent and $A$ is the horizon area. We then constrain the exponent $\delta$ by using Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) observational data. In order to impose the upper bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$, we set the observational bound on $\left| \frac{\delta T_f} {T_f }\right|$. We find out that the Barrow parameter $\delta$ should be around $ \delta \simeq 0.01$ in order not to spoil the BBN era. Next we derive the bound on the Barrow exponent $\delta$ in a different approach in which we analyze the effects of Barrow cosmology on the primordial abundances of light elements i.e. Helium $_{}^{4}\textit{He}$, Deuterium $D$ and Lithium $_{}^{7}\textit{Li}$. We observe that the deviation from standard Bekenstein-Hawking expression is small as expected. Additionally we present the relation between cosmic time $t$ and temperature $T$ in the context of modified Barrow cosmology. We confirm that the temperature of the early universe increases as the Barrow exponent $\delta$ (fractal structure of the horizon) increases, too.</description>

      <title>Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the general conditions for modulus stabilization in a warped braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10668v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In braneworld scenarios with compact extra dimensions, the modulus field typically remains undetermined without an appropriate stabilization mechanism. A common approach introduces a bulk scalar field that generates an effective potential for the modulus with a stable minimum. In this work, we explore some novel aspects of such stabilization mechanisms. We study how the bulk scalar profile influences the stabilization procedure. Following the approach of Chacko et al. [1], we analyze several representative cases using methods of singular perturbation theory. We identify a consistent relationship between the structure of the bulk potential and the emergence of a stabilized modulus, and outline the general conditions that any bulk potential must satisfy to enable stabilization. In this context, we also examine a potential connection between geometric consistency conditions - specifically, the "brane world sum rules" - and the stabilized value of the modulus. In some scenarios where stabilization occurs, we find that these sum rules can offer additional constraints on the modulus, providing a complementary perspective on its determination. Taken together, these results offer a broader perspective on the mechanisms that govern modulus stabilization in higher-dimensional warped geometries.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Tensor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in lattice QCD was traditionally done by calculating matrix elements in the symmetric frame. Recent advancements have significantly reduced computational costs by calculating these matrix elements in the asymmetric frame, allowing us to choose the momentum transfer to be in either the initial or final states only. The theoretical methodology requires a new parametrization of the matrix element to obtain Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, which are then related to the GPDs. The formulation and implementation of this approach have already been established for the unpolarized and helicity GPDs. Building upon this idea, we extend this formulation to the four leading-twist quark transversity GPDs ($H_T$, $E_T$, $\widetilde{H}_T$, $\widetilde{E}_T$). We also present numerical results for zero skewness using an $N_f=2+1+1$ ensemble of twisted mass fermions with a clover improvement. The light quark masses employed in these calculations correspond to a pion mass of about 260 MeV. Furthermore, we include a comparison between the symmetric and asymmetric frame calculations to demonstrate frame independence of the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes. Analysis of the matrix elements in the asymmetric frame is performed at several values of the momentum transfer squared, $-t$, ranging from 0.17 GeV$^2$ to 2.29 GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters using synergy between T2K, NO$\nu$A and JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of combining the present NO$\nu$A and T2K data with simulated data from the JUNO experiment on the determination of the leptonic CP phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy. The current NO$\nu$A data exhibit a hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy, admitting both normal hierarchy (NH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [0,180^\circ]$, and inverted hierarchy (IH) with $\delta_{\rm CP} \in [180^\circ,360^\circ]$ solutions at comparable significance, while T2K prefers $\delta_{\rm CP}\simeq 270^\circ$ for both hierarchies, leading to a $2\sigma$ tension between the two experiments for normal hierarchy. Using detailed GLoBES simulations, we show that future JUNO data with excellent hierarchy sensitivity, can lift the hierarchy--$\delta_{\rm CP}$ degeneracy in NO$\nu$A and strengthen the hierarchy reach of T2K in spite of having no $\delta_{\rm CP}$ sensitivity. Allowing the hierarchy to be a free parameter in the fit, if the true ordering is IH, JUNO aligns the NO$\nu$A and T2K allowed regions and resolves their present tension; if NH is true, the tension continues to persist. We also show that JUNO's precise measurement of $|\Delta_{31}|$ leads to improved constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\rm CP}$ for normal mass hierarchy in NO$\nu$A even though JUNO itself is insensitive to these parameters. Finally, updated solar parameter measurements from JUNO's first data release further enhance the combined precision. Our results demonstrate that JUNO plays a crucial synergistic role in the global neutrino oscillation programme, enabling a more robust determination of the mass ordering and improving the sensitivity to the CP phase when combined with long-baseline data.</description>
