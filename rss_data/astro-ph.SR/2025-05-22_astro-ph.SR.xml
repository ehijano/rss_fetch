      <title>JWST observations of segregated $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ices in protostellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of interstellar ices can be studied with thermal tracers such as the vibrational modes of CO$_2$ ice that show great diversity depending on their local chemical and thermal environment. In this work we present JWST observations of the 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode, the 4.39 $\mu$m stretching mode and the 2.70 $\mu$m combination mode of $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice in the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126 and the low-mass protostar Per-emb 35. The 15.2 $\mu$m bending mode of both protostars shows the characteristic double peak profile that is associated with pure CO$_2$ ice and a sharp short-wavelength peak is observed at 4.38 $\mu$m in the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bands of the two sources. Furthermore, a narrow short-wavelength feature is detected at 2.69 $\mu$m in the $^{12}$CO$_2$ combination mode of Per-emb 35. We perform a consistent profile decomposition on all three vibrational modes and show that the profiles of all three bands can be reproduced with the same linear combination of CO$_2$ ice in mixtures with mostly CH$_3$OH and H$_2$O ices when the ices undergo segregation due to heating. The findings show that upon heating, CO$_2$ ice is likely segregating from mostly the water-rich ice layer and the CO$_2$-CH$_3$OH component becomes dominant in all three vibrational modes. Additionally, we find that the contribution of the different CO$_2$ components to the total absorption band is similar for both $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$. This indicates that fractionation processes must not play a significant role during the different formation epochs, H$_2$O-dominated and CO-dominated. We quantify the $^{12}$CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$ ice column densities and derive $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{ice}$ = 90 $\pm$ 9 in IRAS 20126. Finally, we report the detection of the $^{13}$CO$_2$ bending mode of pure CO$_2$ ice at 15.64 $\mu$m in both IRAS 20126 and Per-emb 35.</description>

      <title>Binary stars take what they get: Evidence for Efficient Mass Transfer from Stripped Stars with Rapidly Rotating Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars and their interactions shape the formation of compact binaries, supernovae, and gravitational wave sources. The efficiency of mass transfer - the fraction of mass retained by the accretor during binary interaction - is a critical parameter that significantly impacts the final fate of these systems. However, this parameter is observationally poorly constrained due to a scarcity of well-characterized post-mass-transfer binaries. Be+sdOB binaries, consisting of a rapidly rotating Be star and a stripped hot subdwarf companion, are particularly valuable for studying mass transfer since they represent clear examples of past binary interaction. Recently, a significantly expanded observational sample of 16 Be+sdOB binaries with well-constrained masses was obtained through combined spectroscopic and interferometric observations. In this work, we compile and analyze this sample to provide robust constraints on the mass transfer efficiency in binaries that underwent stable mass transfer during the donor's hydrogen-shell burning phase. Our analysis reveals that mass transfer was predominantly conservative: half of the systems require mass transfer efficiencies above 50%. This challenges commonly adopted assumptions of highly non-conservative mass transfer in binary evolution modeling. Our findings are inconsistent with models that account for spin-up and limit accretion due to a centrifugal barrier. We also find tension with a commonly used mass transfer model in rapid population synthesis that limits accretion based on the thermal timescale of the accretor. These results have strong implications for almost all products of binary evolution including the variety of supernovae, white dwarfs, blue stragglers, runaway stars, X-ray binaries, and gravitational-wave sources.</description>

      <title>Population demographics of white dwarf binaries with intermediate separations: Gaia constraints on post-AGB mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia mission has revealed a large population of white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d. Such systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the au-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{{\rm orb}}\propto P_{{\rm orb}}^{-0.25}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$. We model the formation of au-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. Explaining the mass distributions of both components requires two key assumptions: (1) the mass growth of the WD is terminated when its AGB progenitor overflows its Roche lobe, and (2) post-AGB binaries binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds a critical threshold, $q_{\rm crit} \approx 0.4$. Systems with more unequal mass ratios likely shrink to shorter periods and become classical post-common envelope binaries or merge. The model implies that $\sim 1\%$ of solar-type stars have WD companions with periods of $100 - 1000\,$d, consistent with complementary constraints from self-lensing binaries.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Stellar and Interstellar Contributions to Polarization: Modeling Approaches for Hot Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear polarimetry of unresolved stars is a powerful method for discerning or constraining the geometry of a source and its environment, since spherical sources produce no net polarization. However, a general challenge to interpreting intrinsic stellar polarization is the contribution to the signal by interstellar polarization (ISP). Here, we review methodologies for distinguishing the stellar signal from the interstellar contribution in the context of massive stars. We first characterize ISP with distance using a recent compilation of starlight polarization catalogs. Several scenarios involving Thomson scattering, rapidly rotating stars, optically thick winds, and interacting binaries are considered specifically to contrast the wavelength-dependent effects of ISP in the ultraviolet versus optical bands. ISP is recognizable in the stellar polarization from Thomson scattering in the polarization position angle rotations. For hot stars with near-critical rotation rates, the ISP declines whereas the stellar continuum polarization sharply increases. In the case of quite dense winds, strong ultraviolet lines trace the ISP, which is not always the case in the optical. In the binary case, temporal and chromatic effects illustrate how the ISP displaces variable polarization with wavelength. This study clarifies the impacts of ISP in relation to new ultraviolet spectropolarimetry efforts such as Polstar and Pollux.</description>

      <title>Extreme Fluctuations in the Sun's Activity over the Modern Maximum: Understanding the Enigmatic Solar Cycles 19-20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past century, the Sun's activity -- which exhibits significant variations -- went through a phase known as the Modern Maximum. Notably, the strongest sunspot cycle on record during this period, and indeed since direct sunspot observations began, was cycle 19; this was followed by a significantly weaker cycle 20. Understanding and reconstructing this extreme variability has remained elusive. Utilizing data-driven, coupled models of magnetic field evolution on the Sun's surface and within its convection zone, here we show that random deviations in the tilt angle and polarity orientation of bipolar sunspot pairs is sufficient to explain these observed, extreme fluctuations during the modern maximum in solar activity. Our results support the theory that perturbation in the poloidal field source of the dynamo mechanism -- mediated via the emergence of anomalously tilted solar active regions - is the primary driver of extreme variations in the Sun's activity. This study has implications for understanding how the Sun may switch from a phase of extreme activity to quiescent, low activity phases -- such as the Maunder Minimum.</description>

      <title>Exploring short-term stellar activity in M dwarfs: A volume-limited perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares are short-lived but energetic manifestations of stellar activity. Studying them is crucial, as they emit intense high-energy radiation that can impact the circumstellar environment, especially the atmospheres of orbiting planets. This is particularly relevant for M dwarfs, which frequently flare and often host planets within their habitable zones. Flare-driven photoevaporation and photochemical processes may significantly affect planetary evolution. In this work, we analyzed the flaring properties of a volume-limited, unbiased sample of nearby M dwarfs using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We selected stars within 10 pc from Gaia DR3 and used an iterative Gaussian process to remove long-term stellar variability from the light curves, isolating impulsive flare events. For each flare, we measured amplitude, duration, and total emitted energy. Our sample includes 173 stars and 17,229 detected flares, ranging from 0 to 76 flares per TESS sector. We focused on three representative stars to highlight the diversity in flare activity. Detected flares had energies above 10^29 erg and durations from 2 to 8000 seconds. We modeled cumulative energy distributions with one- and two-slope power-law fits, finding average slopes of -0.79 +/- 0.64 and -1.23 +/- 1.32, respectively. We introduced the Flare Energy Index (GF.01) to describe flare frequency, identifying two populations: fainter stars tend to produce fewer high-energy flares, while brighter stars exhibit more frequent low-energy flares. Finally, we investigated two highly active stars, G 227-22 and G 258-33, observed across many sectors, to study long-term flare behavior and energy trends.</description>

      <title>The effects of expansion and turbulence on the interplanetary evolution of a magnetic cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) represent the most extreme solar products, showing complex and dynamic structures when detected in situ. They are often preceded by a shock and carry a magnetic cloud organised as a flux rope, surrounded and permeated by turbulent fluctuations, and whose radial size expands during propagation. We investigate the internal dynamics of the 2D section of a cylindrical flux rope propagating at constant velocity in the spherically expanding solar wind, employing the expanding box model, which allows for high spatial resolution. Our setting is simplified, with uniform and non-magnetised solar wind, to which we superpose turbulent fluctuations. We find that the spherically expanding geometry alone perturbs the flux rope equilibrium, producing a radial head-tail velocity profile and a radial size increase. The ratio between the expansion and Alfv\'en timescales, associated respectively to propagation and internal crossing time, controls the resistance to transverse stretching and the increase of the flux rope radial extent; the plasma beta controls the overall size of the structure. Turbulent fluctuations mainly affect the flux rope transverse structure, spreading its axial field at distances comparable to its size; on the contrary, dynamics along the radial direction remains coherent and the increase in radial size is still consistently observed. We validate our results by comparison with statistical observations and dimensionless estimates, such as the expansion parameter and the radial size scaling exponent, suggesting that the ratio between internal and propagation timescales might help in better classifying different kinds of radial expansions for flux ropes.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing white dwarf from the Zwicky Transient Facility: II. Seven eclipsing double white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a systematic search for eclipsing white dwarfs using Zwicky transient facility (ZTF) data, we found seven eclipsing double white dwarfs with orbital periods ranging from 45 minutes to 3 hours. We collected high-speed light curves, archival multi-wavelength data, and optical spectra for all systems and determined the binary parameters for each of them. We show that six of the systems are low-mass, double helium-core white dwarf binaries, with the last one a carbon-oxygen -- helium core white dwarf binary. These binaries slowly spiral inwards due to gravitational wave energy losses and are expected to merge within 36Myr--1.2Gyr, and we predict that the shortest orbital period binary will show a measurable eclipse arrival time delay within a decade. The two longest systems show a delay in the arrival time of the secondary eclipse, which we attribute to a small eccentricity of $\approx 2\times10^{-3}$. This is the first time that a non-zero eccentricity is measured in a compact double white dwarf binary. We suggest that these systems emerged from the common envelope with this small eccentricity, and because of the relatively long orbital period, gravitational wave emission has not yet circularised the binaries. Finally, we predict that relativistic apsidal precession will result in a change in the delay of the secondary eclipse that is measurable within a decade.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Study of Blue Straggler Stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 3201</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a spectroscopic study of 39 blue straggler stars in the globular cluster NGC 3201. The spectra of these stars were collected from the literature. We determined the radial velocity, atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g), and the abundance of Mg, as well as the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of the blue straggler population. The mean radial velocity and [Fe/H] are determined to be 498.0 $\pm$ 5.3 km/s and -1.42 $\pm$ 0.27, respectively, for the blue straggler stars. The derived [Fe/H] is consistent, within uncertainties, with the cluster's [Fe/H] of -1.59 dex. The mean [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars is estimated to be 0.36 $\pm$ 0.73. Importantly, this study first estimates [Mg/Fe] for the blue straggler stars in the cluster NGC 3201.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Spin-down Glitch in PSR J1835$-$1106</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of a spin-down glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, demonstrating that one of the spin-down glitch models proposed by Kantor &amp; Gusakov (2014) is not applicable to PSR J1835$-$1106.</description>

      <title>Global properties, fractality, and mass segregation in single, paired, and grouped open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and dynamical properties of Open Clusters (OCs) classified as single, in pairs, or in groups. By analysing their mass, size, age, fractality, and mass segregation, we aim to identify systematic differences among these categories and evaluate the role of the Galactic environment in their evolution. Our sample comprises 420 single OCs, 415 in pairs, and 317 in groups. To characterise their structure, we apply the Q-parameter, which distinguishes fractal from radial distributions. We also compute the local density ratio to quantify mass segregation and explore its dependence on environment. Grouped OCs tend to be the youngest, followed by those in pairs, while single OCs generally exhibit older ages. Although sizes are comparable, OCs in pairs and groups tend to be less concentrated. Structurally, grouped OCs show the highest fractality, which decreases with age as clusters evolve towards more radial configurations. Mass segregation is detected in ~80% of OCs, with a slightly higher incidence in single clusters. Some older single OCs show inverse segregation, with massive stars at larger radii. Spatially, single OCs are more dispersed, whereas paired and grouped ones are concentrated in spiral arms and star-forming regions. OC evolution appears to be shaped by both internal dynamics and environmental influences. Single OCs tend to exhibit signs of more advanced dynamical evolution, whereas those in pairs and groups may retain features reflecting their formation environment. Substructures and high fractality in younger clusters suggest that early interactions play a key role in their long-term development. More massive OCs evolve towards radial configurations, while less massive ones may retain fractal properties for longer. These findings highlight the interplay between intrinsic properties and external conditions in shaping OC evolution.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Determination of the Tidal Deformability of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star from Gravitational-Wave Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal deformability of a 1.4 $M_\odot$ neutron star provides a pivotal window into the physics of dense nuclear matter, bridging gravitational-wave(GW), electromagnetic observations and nuclear physics. In this work, we present a novel, data-driven approach to constrain $\Lambda_{1.4}$ without invoking specific equation-of-state(EOS) models. By interpolating directly over the mass--tidal-deformability posteriors from GW170817, we obtain an EOS-independent constraint of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 222.89_{-98.85}^{+420.33}. $ We further combine these GW-based results with the X-ray EOS-independent constraint from \cite{Huang_2025}, deriving a multimessenger limit of $ \Lambda_{1.4} \;=\; 265.18_{-104.38}^{+237.88}, $ which remains largely EOS agnostic. This framework demonstrates that higher-order terms neglected in linear expansion methods do not significantly affect $\Lambda_{1.4}$ estimates under current observational uncertainties. As gravitational-wave detectors improve in sensitivity and more binary neutron-star mergers are discovered, our purely data-driven strategy can serve as a robust standard baseline for extracting neutron-star interior properties without relying on unverified EOS models.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Laboratory Benchmark of K-shell Dielectronic Satellites of Fe XXV-XXI Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on comprehensive laboratory studies of the K-shell dielectronic recombination (DR) resonances of Fe XXV - XXI ions that prominently contribute to the hard X-ray spectrum of hot astrophysical plasmas. By scanning a monoenergetic electron beam to resonantly excite trapped Fe ions in an electron beam ion trap, and achieving a high electron-ion collision energy resolution of ~7 eV, we resolve their respective KL$n$ satellites up to n'=11. By normalization to known radiative recombination cross sections we also determine their excitation cross sections and that of the continuum with uncertainties below 15%, and verify our results with an independent normalization based on previous measurements. Our experimental data excellently confirm the accuracy and suitability of distorted-wave calculations obtained with the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) for modeling astrophysical and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>A self-regulated convolutional neural network for classifying variable stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Habitability using Biogenic Precursors: Formaldehyde in Millimeter Molecular Clouds of the Inner Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of formaldehyde (H2CO) absorption and radio recombination line (H110a) emission in 215 molecular clouds from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), observed using the Nanshan 25-m radio telescope. H2CO was detected in 88 sources (40.93 percent) with 59 being new detections, while H110a emission was found in only 11 sources (5.12 percent), all coincident with H2CO absorption. There exists a correlation of H2CO fluxes with millimeter fluxes below a 3 Jy threshold and an increased dispersion above it, suggesting the sub-CMB cooling of H2CO. Cross-matching with kinematic distance catalogs revealed H2CO spanning galactocentric distances from 0.216 to 10.769 kpc, with column densities ranging from 7.82 x 10^11 to 6.69 x 10^14 cm-2. A significant inverse correlation was observed between H2CO detection fraction and galactocentric distance, suggesting enhanced star forming activity closer to the Galactic Center. These findings challenge traditional Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) models by demonstrating the presence of biogenic precursors in the inner Galaxy, shielded within dense molecular clouds. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating chemical tracers like H2CO, alongside physical constraints, to refine the boundaries of the GHZ and advance the research of prebiotic chemistry in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling the mass feeding rates onto accretion-modified stars embedded within AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes can potentially form stars within the self-gravitating region. These stars undergo high accretion rates because of the dense environment of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. The vorticity of the AGN disk may influence the ultimate mass feeding rate toward the star. In our study, we simulate mass feeding rates onto stars at different AGN disk thicknesses through 3D numerical models to explore the relationship between feeding rates and the thermal mass of the star ($q_{\rm th}$), defined as the ratio of the star's Bondi radius to the AGN disk thickness. Our findings indicate that disk shearing with angular momentum can notably decrease the feeding rate, and we provide an approximate formula that links the feeding rate based on the angular momentum of the surrounding gas and the thermal mass $q_{\rm th}$. Lastly, we examine the potential feedback of the rapidly accreting stars on the AGN disk and their subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal emission effect on Chandrasekhar's $H(\mu)$-function for isotropic scattering in semi-infinite atmosphere problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chandrasekhars $H(\mu)$-function has long been a cornerstone of radiative transfer theory in semi-infinite, isotropically scattering atmospheres subjected to external illumination. However, this classical formulation does not account for thermal emission arising from internal heat sources, which is critical in a variety of astrophysical contexts such as hot Jupiters, brown dwarfs, and irradiated exoplanets, where the re-radiation of absorbed stellar energy significantly alters the emergent intensity. To address this limitation, we extend the diffuse reflection framework to incorporate both isotropic scattering and intrinsic thermal emission, leading to a generalized function known as the $M(\mu)$-function. Building on the formalism of Chandrashekhar (1960) combined with the recent work by Sengupta(2021), we derive the governing integral equations for the $M$-function and express it in terms of three key physical parameters: the radiation direction cosine $\mu$, the thermal emission coefficient $U(T) = B(T)/F$, and the single scattering albedo $\tilde{\omega}_0$. We implement a numerically stable iterative scheme, using Gaussian quadrature method to compute high-precision values of $M(\mu, U, \tilde{\omega}_0)$ across a broad parameter space. In the zero-emission limit, our results recover the classical $H$-function, thus validating the method.We provide comprehensive values of $M$-function for $\mu \in [0, 1]$, $U &lt; 0.7$, and $\tilde{\omega}_0 &lt; 1$, enabling direct application to modeling diffusely reflected intensities from thermally emitting atmospheres.As a case study, we apply this formalism to exoplanet K2-137b and identify the wavelength range (0.85 -2.5 $\mu$m) where the model is most applicable, highlighting its relevance to the observation range of the telescopes JWST, HST, ARIEL.</description>

      <title>An efficient integrator for stellar dynamics in effective gravity fields based on the isochrone potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Integrating the motion of stars in a smoothed potential is necessary in many stellar and galactic studies. Previous works have often used numerical integrators that alternate between linear drifts and velocity kicks (such as the Leapfrog scheme). This approach contrasts with the sophisticated methods developed in planetary dynamics, for which integrators alternate between Keplerian drifts and velocity kicks.
  Aims. Inspired by the splitting methods used in planetary dynamics, we aim to build an integration scheme dedicated to stellar and galactic dynamics.
  Methods. We took advantage of the properties of H\'enon's isochrone potential to design a symplectic splitting scheme that can be used to integrate the motion of stars in any gravitational potential. This scheme alternates between isochrone drifts and velocity kicks. As a first application, we consider the motion of a star in a Plummer potential -- an essential constituent of galactic potentials -- and determine integration parameters that provide the best efficiency (i.e. best conservation of energy for lowest computational cost).
  Results. We derive the analytical solution for all kinds of orbits in H\'enon's isochrone potential (bound and unbound trajectories) as needed in our integration scheme. Our experiments for stars in a Plummer potential show excellent performances in the inner and outer parts of the gravity field, that is, where the motion of stars is well approximated by isochrone trajectories (with perturbations of order $10^{-3}$ or less). For highly elongated orbits that cross the characteristic length of the Plummer potential, the performance is equivalent to that of previous methods.
  Conclusions. The splitting scheme presented here is a good alternative to previous methods: it performs at least as well, and up to orders of magnitude better, depending on the dynamical regime of the star.</description>

      <title>Life after death: Europa in the evolving Habitable Zone of a Red Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars end their main-sequence (MS) lives by evolving through the red-giant and asymptotic-giant branches before ending as a quiescent, stable white dwarf. Therefore, it is imperative to model the post-MS as it relates to long-term stability of environments potentially suitable for life. Recent work has shown that gas giants can exist in the habitable zone (HZ) during the red giant phase and around a white dwarf remnant. Icy moons represent large reservoirs of water and will evolve through sublimation and melting when exposed to higher instellation, where the relatively lower surface gravity could lead to the rapid loss of all surface water. We model the surface evolution of Europa when initially exposed to habitable zone instellation in the red giant branch. Modeling the diurnal and yearly flux variations on a 2D map we show that, due to Jupiter's increased albedo, the sub-Jovian hemisphere of Europa largely sublimates while only the anti-Jovian equatorial band sublimates. With the increasing instellation of the red giant branch, both hemispheres sublimate substantially. We then model the evolution of a tenuous water-vapor atmosphere and show it is stable against atmospheric loss for at least 0.2 Gyr in the red giant branch habitable zone. We then present three ways to observe a sublimating Europan-like exomoon and potential spectra. Extending the results of this work to different planets and moons could open up a new pathway by which life could persist beyond the death of a star.</description>

      <title>How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.</description>

      <title>The nature of small scale EUV solar brightenings investigated as impulsive heating of short loops in 1D hydrododynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small (400 to 4000 km) and short lived (10 to 200 km) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings, detected by the High Resolution Imager EUV (HRIEUV), have been found to be ubiquitous in the Quiet Sun (QS). Their contribution to coronal heating as well as their physical origin are currently being investigated. We wish to determine whether models of short loops and impulsive heating are compatible with the results from observations. In particular, we used two models of loops with distinct thermal properties: cool (T below 1E5 K) and hot loops (T above 1E5 K). We simulated the evolution of impulsively heated short loops, using the 1D hydrodynamics (HD) code HYDRAD. We computed the synthetic light curves of HRIEUV, four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and five emission lines measured by the SPectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE). We then compared the results from the synthetic light curves with observations. The aim was to reproduce the short delays observed between the intensity peaks of the light curves. Cool loops subjected to impulsive heating are good candidates to explain the physical origin of the EUV brightenings. On the other hand, hot loops are not consistent with observations, except when they are subjected to especially strong impulsive heating.</description>

      <title>Improving the {\Gamma}-functions Method for Vortex Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortices have been observed at various heights within the solar atmosphere and are suggested to potentially play great roles in heating the solar upper atmosphere. Multiple automated vortex detection methods have been developed and applied to detect vortices. We aim to improve the $\Gamma$-functions method for vortex identification by optimizing the value of $\Gamma_{1min}$ and the approach to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ used to determine vortex center and edge. In this way, we can detect vortices more accurately and enable more statistical studies that can improve our knowledge of the generation and evolution of vortices in the solar atmosphere. We apply the automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA, one representative of $\Gamma$-functions method) with different parameters to various synthetic data, with each containing 1000 Lamb-Oseen vortices, and search for the optimal $\Gamma_{1min}$ and kernel size when calculating $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. We also compare another detection method using simulation and observational data to validate the results obtained from the synthetic data. The best performance is found with the Optimized ASDA, which combines different kernel sizes (5, 7, 9, and 11) to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with a fixed $\Gamma_{1min}$ = 0.63 to detect vortex center. We find that more vortices can be detected by the Optimized ASDA with higher location, radius, and rotation speed accuracies. The above results are further confirmed by comparing vortices detected by the Optimized ASDA and the SWIRL method on CO5BOLD numerical simulation data and SST observational data.</description>

      <title>Five New Sirius-Like White Dwarf + Main Sequence Star Systems with MagAO-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most known white dwarfs in multiple systems with main sequence stars have been discovered with M-type companions, because the white dwarf causes detectable UV excess and bluer colors than expected from a single M star. Surveys have shown that the number of white dwarfs in Sirius-like systems within 100 pc of the Sun is lower than expected, suggesting that white dwarfs are being missed in the glare of their main sequence companions. In this work we have leveraged the angular resolution and high-contrast capabilities, as well as optimization for visible wavelengths, of the extreme adaptive optics instrument MagAO-X to detect new white dwarf companions to AFGK stars. We present the first results of our survey with the extreme AO instrument MagAO-X, called the Pup Search, of 18 targets with seven new candidate companions, five of which are confirmed to be white dwarfs. We discuss the new detections in the context of previous surveys and other detection metric sensitivities and show that we are sensitive to a region not probed by other surveys. Finally we discuss the future of the Pup Search in light of developing technologies.</description>
