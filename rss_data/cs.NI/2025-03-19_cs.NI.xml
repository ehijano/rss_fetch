      <title>A Comprehensive Study of IPTV: Challenges, Opportunities, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a transformative approach to delivering audio and video services through high-speed Internet networks, enabling direct access to television content via home computers or set-top boxes. Despite its promising advantages, including flexibility, interactivity, and bundled services such as triple play (voice, Internet, and TV) and quadruple play (adding mobile services), IPTV is still in its development phase. Key challenges include achieving a Quality of Service (QoS) comparable to traditional broadcasters, addressing limited bandwidth, and overcoming a lack of standardization among service providers.
  This paper explores the technical, operational, and consumer-oriented aspects of IPTV. It discusses data compression techniques, protocols like IGMP and RTSP, and the role of advanced codecs like H.264 in ensuring efficient data transmission. The study also examines the distinctions between IPTV and open-network Internet TV, the importance of security and privacy, and the emergence of new business opportunities through targeted advertising and interactive services. Although IPTV is unlikely to completely replace traditional broadcasting, it is poised to play an important role in shaping the future of television by offering personalized, secure, and scalable viewing experiences.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Non-Terrestrial Networks by Spherical Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are anticipated to be indispensable in extending coverage and enabling global communication access in next-generation wireless networks. With the extensive deployment of non-terrestrial platforms, evaluating the performance of NTN-enabled communication systems becomes a challenging task. Spherical stochastic geometry (SG) is a recently proposed analytical framework that has garnered increasing attention. Due to its suitability for modeling large-scale dynamic topologies and its ability to provide an analytical framework for interference analysis and low-complexity performance evaluation, spherical SG has been widely applied in NTN performance analysis. This paper surveys the modeling and analysis of NTN networks based on spherical SG. We begin by introducing the spherical SG framework, detailing its history and development. Next, we categorize existing spherical SG models into three types based on orbital modeling methods and provide algorithm implementations for common models. Furthermore, we investigate the accuracy and necessity of spherical modeling through case studies. On the topology level, concepts such as association strategy, central angle, zenith angle, contact angle, and availability probability are introduced, with simple derivations provided. On the channel level, we detail the modeling of large-scale fading, small-scale fading, and beam gain for different channel links. Finally, we discuss several advanced topics that have not been fully explored but have strong motivation and research potential, and we predict future research directions.</description>

      <title>Mobility-aware Seamless Service Migration and Resource Allocation in Multi-edge IoV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers low-latency and high-bandwidth support for Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, due to high vehicle mobility and finite communication coverage of base stations, it is hard to maintain uninterrupted and high-quality services without proper service migration among MEC servers. Existing solutions commonly rely on prior knowledge and rarely consider efficient resource allocation during the service migration process, making it hard to reach optimal performance in dynamic IoV environments. To address these important challenges, we propose SR-CL, a novel mobility-aware seamless Service migration and Resource allocation framework via Convex-optimization-enabled deep reinforcement Learning in multi-edge IoV systems. First, we decouple the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem of service migration and resource allocation into two sub-problems. Next, we design a new actor-critic-based asynchronous-update deep reinforcement learning method to handle service migration, where the delayed-update actor makes migration decisions and the one-step-update critic evaluates the decisions to guide the policy update. Notably, we theoretically derive the optimal resource allocation with convex optimization for each MEC server, thereby further improving system performance. Using the real-world datasets of vehicle trajectories and testbed, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SR-CL. Compared to benchmark methods, the SR-CL achieves superior convergence and delay performance under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sketch Disaggregation Across Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming analytics are essential in a large range of applications, including databases, networking, and machine learning. To optimize performance, practitioners are increasingly offloading such analytics to network nodes such as switches. However, resources such as fast SRAM memory available at switches are limited, not uniform, and may serve other functionalities as well (e.g., firewall). Moreover, resource availability can also change over time due to the dynamic demands of in-network applications.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach to disaggregating data structures over time and space, leveraging any residual resource available at network nodes. We focus on sketches, which are fundamental for summarizing data for streaming analytics while providing beneficial space-accuracy tradeoffs. Our idea is to break sketches into multiple `fragments' that are placed at different network nodes. The fragments cover different time periods and are of varying sizes, and are combined to form a network-wide view of the underlying traffic. We apply our solution to three popular sketches (namely, Count Sketch, Count-Min Sketch, and UnivMon) and demonstrate we can achieve approximately a 75% memory size reduction for the same error for many queries, or a near order-of-magnitude error reduction if memory is kept unchanged.</description>

      <title>Towards Energy- and QoS-aware Load Balancing for 6G: Leveraging O-RAN to Achieve Sustainable and Energy-Efficient 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge posed by the increasing energy consumption in mobile networks, particularly with the advent of Sixth Generation (6G) technologies. We propose an adaptive network management framework that leverages the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture to enhance network adaptability and energy efficiency. By utilizing O-RAN's open interfaces and intelligent controllers, our approach implements dynamic resource management strategies that respond to fluctuating user demands while maintaining the quality of service. We design and implement O-RAN-compliant applications to validate our framework, demonstrating significant improvements in energy efficiency without compromising network performance. Our study offers a comprehensive guide for utilizing O-RAN's open architecture to achieve sustainable and energy-efficient 6G networks, aligning with global efforts to reduce the environmental impact of mobile communication systems.</description>

      <title>Compact routing schemes in undirected and directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of compact routing schemes in weighted undirected and directed graphs.
  For weighted undirected graphs, more than a decade ago, Chechik [PODC 2013] presented a \(3.68k\)-stretch compact routing scheme that uses \(\tilde{O}(n^{1/k} \log D)\) local storage, where \(D\) is the normalized diameter, for every \(k&gt;1\). We improve the \(3.68k\)-stretch to \(2.64k\)-stretch by allowing every vertex to use \(\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})\) local storage on average. This resolves a key open question by demonstrating the existence of a routing scheme with stretch \(c \cdot k\) for some constant \(c&lt;3\).
  More than two decades ago, Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] considered compact routing schemes that establish a communication session using a handshake. In their handshake-based compact routing scheme, the handshake is routed along a \((4k-5)\)-stretch path, and the rest of the communication session is routed along an optimal \((2k-1)\)-stretch path. It is straightforward to improve the \((4k-5)\)-stretch path of the handshake to \(3.68k\)-stretch using the compact routing scheme of Chechik [PODC 2013]. We improve the handshake stretch to the optimal \((2k-1)\), by introducing the concept of roundtrip routing in undirected graphs and developing an optimal \((2k-1)\)-stretch compact roundtrip routing scheme, which is of independent interest.
  For weighted directed graphs, more than two decades ago, Roditty, Thorup, and Zwick [SODA 2002, TALG 2008] presented a \((4k+\varepsilon)\)-stretch compact roundtrip routing scheme that uses \(\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})\) local storage for every \(k\ge 3\). For \(k=3\), this gives a \((12+\varepsilon)\)-roundtrip stretch using \(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})\) local storage. We improve the stretch by developing a \(7\)-roundtrip stretch routing scheme with \(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})\) local storage.</description>

      <title>SNAKE: A Sustainable and Multi-functional Traffic Analysis System utilizing Specialized Large-Scale Models with a Mixture of Experts Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of internet technology has led to a surge in data transmission, making network traffic classification crucial for security and management. However, there are significant deficiencies in its efficiency for handling multiattribute analysis and its ability to expand model knowledge, making it difficult to adapt to the ever-changing network environment and complex identification requirements. To address this issue, we proposed the SNAKE (Sustainable Network Analysis with Knowledge Exploration) system, which adopts a multi-gated mixture of experts architecture to construct a multi-functional traffic classification model. The system analyzes traffic attributes at different levels through multiple expert sub-models, providing predictions for these attributes via gating and a final Tower network. Additionally, through an intelligent gating configuration, the system enables extremely fast model integration and evolution across various knowledge expansion scenarios. Its excellent compatibility allows it to continuously evolve into a multi-functional largescale model in the field of traffic analysis. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SNAKE system exhibits remarkable scalability when faced with incremental challenges in diverse traffic classification tasks. Currently, we have integrated multiple models into the system, enabling it to classify a wide range of attributes, such as encapsulation usage, application types and numerous malicious behaviors. We believe that SNAKE can pioneeringly create a sustainable and multifunctional large-scale model in the field of network traffic analysis after continuous expansion.</description>

      <title>Bitcoin Burn Addresses: Unveiling the Permanent Losses and Their Underlying Causes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bitcoin burn addresses are addresses where bitcoins can be sent but never retrieved, resulting in the permanent loss of those coins. Given Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins, understanding the usage and the amount of bitcoins lost in burn addresses is crucial for evaluating their economic impact. However, identifying burn addresses is challenging due to the lack of standardized format or convention. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the automatic detection of burn addresses using a multi-layer perceptron model trained on a manually classified dataset of 196,088 regular addresses and 2,082 burn addresses. Our model identified 7,905 true burn addresses from a pool of 1,283,997,050 addresses with only 1,767 false positive. We determined that 3,197.61 bitcoins have been permanently lost, representing only 0.016% of the total supply, yet 295 million USD on November 2024. More than 99% of the lost bitcoins are concentrated in just three addresses. This skewness highlights diverse uses of burn addresses, including token creation via proof-of-burn, storage of plain text messages, or storage of images using the OLGA Stamps protocol.</description>

      <title>Effect of Hotspot Traffic on Blocking Probability in Elastic Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a circuit-switched network, traffic can be characterized by several factors that define how communication resources are allocated and utilized during a connection. The amount of traffic basically determines how frequently connection requests arrive, how long the setup connection remains active, and the bandwidth used. The Poisson Arrival Process models traffic arrival events at random intervals. It assumes that events happen independently of one another. This model is ideal for simulating traffic in networks where arrivals happen independently and randomly, such as the start of phone calls, data requests, or packet transmissions. The Poisson Arrival Process and uniformly choosing source and destination pair is been used most commonly by researchers to generate traffic in a network to test various promising routing and spectrum assignment algorithms. It checks the algorithm in uniformly loaded conditions and estimate its baseline performance. In real real-world scenario, a bunch of network nodes can start experiencing heavy data traffic compared to the rest of the network. This can lead to latency issues, or even outages if the network is not optimized to handle the load at these nodes which are also called hotspots. In other terms, hotspot in a network is an area or set of nodes within the network that have a higher likelihood of being involved in communication or data transmission compared to other areas. In this paper, we have tried to find what are the various factors involved in increasing the blocking probability in hotspot traffic scenarios. We have also compared the results with the uniform traffic load conditions in same topology.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Bandwidth Assignment and Relay Positioning for Predictive Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying Networks (FNs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide on-demand wireless connectivity when network coverage is insufficient or the communications infrastructure is compromised, such as in disaster management scenarios. Despite extensive research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) positioning and radio resource allocation, the challenge of ensuring reliable traffic relay through backhaul links in predictive FNs remains unexplored.
  This work proposes Simulated Annealing for predictive FNs (SAFnet), an innovative algorithm that optimizes network performance under positioning constraints, limited bandwidth and minimum rate requirements. Our algorithm uniquely leverages prior knowledge of the first-tier node trajectories to assign bandwidth and dynamically adjust the position of the second-tier flying relay. Building upon Simulated Annealing, our approach enhances this well-known AI algorithm with penalty functions, achieving performance levels comparable to exhaustive search while significantly reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Video Streaming with Kairos: An MPC-Based ABR with Streaming-Aware Throughput Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Kairos, a model predictive control (MPC)-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) scheme that integrates streaming-aware throughput predictions to enhance video streaming quality. Kairos features an attention-based throughput predictor with buffer-aware uncertainty control, improving prediction accuracy and adaptability to network conditions. Specifically, we introduce a multi-time attention network to handle the irregularly sampled sequences in streaming data, creating uniformly spaced latent representations. Additionally, we design a separate prediction network that estimates future throughput at multiple percentiles and incorporates a buffer-aware uncertainty adjustment module. This module dynamically selects the appropriate throughput percentile based on the buffer size, enhancing robustness to varying network conditions. Lastly, to mitigate QoE smoothness penalties caused by predictors focused solely on accuracy, we introduce a smoothness regularizer. By embedding streaming-aware characteristics, such as sampling irregularity, buffer occupancy, and smoothness, into the throughput predictor design, Kairos significantly improves bitrate decision-making within the MPC framework. Extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments demonstrate that Kairos outperforms state-of-the-art ABR schemes, achieving an average QoE improvement of 1.52% to 7.28% under various network conditions.</description>

      <title>Load-Balancing versus Anycast: A First Look at Operational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Load Balancing (LB) is a routing strategy that increases performance by distributing traffic over multiple outgoing links. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology to detect the influence of LB on anycast routing, which can be used by operators to detect network regions that experience anycast routing instability. We use our methodology to measure the effects of LB-behavior on anycast routing at a global scale, covering both IPv4 and IPv6. Our results show that LB-induced anycast routing instability is widespread. The results also show our method can detect LB implementations on the global Internet, including detection and classification of Points-of-Presence (PoP) and egress selection techniques deployed by hypergiants, cloud providers, and network operators. We observe LB-induced routing instability directs distinct flows to different anycast sites with significant latency inflation. In cases with two paths between an anycast instance and a load-balanced destination, we observe an average RTT difference of 30 ms with 8% of load-balanced destinations seeing RTT differences of over 100 ms. Being able to detect these cases can help anycast operators significantly improve their service for affected clients.</description>

      <title>BodySense: An Expandable and Wearable-Sized Wireless Evaluation Platform for Human Body Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wearable, wirelessly connected sensors have become a common part of daily life and have the potential to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of personalized healthcare. A key challenge in this evolution is designing long-lasting and unobtrusive devices. These design requirements inherently demand smaller batteries, inevitably increasing the need for energy-sensitive wireless communication interfaces. Capacitive Human Body Communication (HBC) is a promising, power-efficient alternative to traditional RF-based communication, enabling point-to-multipoint data and energy exchange. However, as this concept relies on capacitive coupling to the surrounding area, it is naturally influenced by uncontrollable environmental factors, making testing with classical setups particularly challenging. This work presents a customizable, wearable-sized, wireless evaluation platform for capacitive HBC, designed to enable realistic evaluation of wearable-to-wearable applications. Comparative measurements of channel gains were conducted using classical grid-connected and wireless Data Acquisition (DAQ) across various transmission distances within the frequency range of 4 MHz to 64 MHz and revealed an average overestimation of 18.15 dB over all investigated distances in the classical setup.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Data Transfer Performance and Energy Efficiency with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data across fields of science and industry has increased the need to improve the performance of end-to-end data transfers while using the resources more efficiently. In this paper, we present a dynamic, multiparameter reinforcement learning (RL) framework that adjusts application-layer transfer settings during data transfers on shared networks. Our method strikes a balance between high throughput and low energy utilization by employing reward signals that focus on both energy efficiency and fairness. The RL agents can pause and resume transfer threads as needed, pausing during heavy network use and resuming when resources are available, to prevent overload and save energy. We evaluate several RL techniques and compare our solution with state-of-the-art methods by measuring computational overhead, adaptability, throughput, and energy consumption. Our experiments show up to 25% increase in throughput and up to 40% reduction in energy usage at the end systems compared to baseline methods, highlighting a fair and energy-efficient way to optimize data transfers in shared network environments.</description>

      <title>A Modular Edge Device Network for Surgery Digitalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future surgical care demands real-time, integrated data to drive informed decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The pressing need for seamless and efficient data capture in the OR motivates our development of a modular solution that bridges the gap between emerging machine learning techniques and interventional medicine. We introduce a network of edge devices, called Data Hubs (DHs), that interconnect diverse medical sensors, imaging systems, and robotic tools via optical fiber and a centralized network switch. Built on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, each DH supports multiple interfaces (HDMI, USB-C, Ethernet) and encapsulates device-specific drivers within Docker containers using the Isaac ROS framework and ROS2. A centralized user interface enables straightforward configuration and real-time monitoring, while an Nvidia DGX computer provides state-of-the-art data processing and storage. We validate our approach through an ultrasound-based 3D anatomical reconstruction experiment that combines medical imaging, pose tracking, and RGB-D data acquisition.</description>

      <title>5G-Enabled Teleoperated Driving: An Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleoperated driving enables remote human intervention in autonomous vehicles, addressing challenges in complex driving environments. However, its effectiveness depends on ultra-low latency, high-reliability communication. This paper evaluates teleoperated driving over 5G networks, analyzing key performance metrics such as glass-to-glass (G2G) latency, RTT and steering command delay. Using a real-world testbed with a Kia Soul EV and a remote teleoperation platform, we assess the feasibility and limitations of 5G-enabled teleoperated driving. Our system achieved an average G2G latency of 202ms and an RTT of 47ms highlighting the G2G latency as the critical bottleneck. The steering control proved to be mostly accurate and responsive. Finally, this paper provides recommendations and outlines future work to improve future teleoperated driving deployments for safer and more reliable autonomous mobility.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Demand-Aware Link Scheduling for Reconfigurable Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging reconfigurable datacenters allow to dynamically adjust the network topology in a demand-aware manner. These datacenters rely on optical switches which can be reconfigured to provide direct connectivity between racks, in the form of edge-disjoint matchings. While state-of-the-art optical switches in principle support microsecond reconfigurations, the demand-aware topology optimization constitutes a bottleneck.
  This paper proposes a dynamic algorithms approach to improve the performance of reconfigurable datacenter networks, by supporting faster reactions to changes in the traffic demand. This approach leverages the temporal locality of traffic patterns in order to update the interconnecting matchings incrementally, rather than recomputing them from scratch. In particular, we present six (batch-)dynamic algorithms and compare them to static ones. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on 176 synthetic and 39 real-world traces, and find that dynamic algorithms can both significantly improve the running time and reduce the number of changes to the configuration, especially in networks with high temporal locality, while retaining matching weight.</description>

      <title>Mowgli: Passively Learned Rate Control for Real-Time Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rate control algorithms are at the heart of video conferencing platforms, determining target bitrates that match dynamic network characteristics for high quality. Recent data-driven strategies have shown promise for this challenging task, but the performance degradation they introduce during training has been a nonstarter for many production services, precluding adoption. This paper aims to bolster the practicality of data-driven rate control by presenting an alternative avenue for experiential learning: leveraging purely existing telemetry logs produced by the incumbent algorithm in production. We observe that these logs contain effective decisions, although often at the wrong times or in the wrong order. To realize this approach despite the inherent uncertainty that log-based learning brings (i.e., lack of feedback for new decisions), our system, Mowgli, combines a variety of robust learning techniques (i.e., conservatively reasoning about alternate behavior to minimize risk and using a richer model formulation to account for environmental noise). Across diverse networks (emulated and real-world), Mowgli outperforms the widely deployed GCC algorithm, increasing average video bitrates by 15-39% while reducing freeze rates by 60-100%.</description>

      <title>A Reference Architecture for Autonomous Networks: An Agent-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12871</link>

Abstract: The vision of autonomous systems is becoming increasingly important in many application areas, where the aim is to replace humans with agents. These include autonomous vehicles and other agents' applications in business processes and problem-solving. For networks, the increasing scale and operation and management (O&amp;M) complexity drive the need for autonomous networks (AN). The technical objective of AN is to ensure trustworthy O&amp;M without human intervention for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. However, realizing AN seems more difficult than autonomous vehicles. It encounters challenges of networks' structural and functional complexity, which operate as distributed dynamic systems governed by various technical and economic constraints. A key problem lies in formulating a rigorous development methodology that facilitates a seamless transition from traditional networks to AN. Central to this methodology is the definition of a reference architecture for network agents, which specifies the required functionalities for their realization, regardless of implementation choices. This article proposes a reference architecture characterizing main functional features, illustrating its application with network use cases. It shows how artificial intelligence components can be used to implement the required functionality and its coordination. The latter is achieved through the management and generation of shared domain-specific knowledge stored in long-term memory, ensuring the overall consistency of decisions and their execution. The article concludes with a discussion of architecture specialization for building network layer agents. It also identifies the main technical challenges ahead, such as satisfying essential requirements at development or runtime, as well as the issue of coordinating agents to achieve collective intelligence in meeting overall network goals.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Inference with On-Device Small and Remote Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a hybrid language model (HLM) architecture that integrates a small language model (SLM) operating on a mobile device with a large language model (LLM) hosted at the base station (BS) of a wireless network. The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54$\times$ faster token throughput than HLM without skipping.</description>
