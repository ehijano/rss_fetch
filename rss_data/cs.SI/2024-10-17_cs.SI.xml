      <title>Design and Feasibility of a Community Motorcycle Ambulance System in the Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential for motorcycle ambulance (motorlance) deployment in Metro Manila and Iloilo City to improve emergency medical care in high-traffic, underserved regions of the Philippines. VSee, a humanitarian technology company, has organized numerous free clinics in the Philippines and identified a critical need for improved emergency services. Motorlances offer a fast, affordable alternative to traditional ambulances, particularly in congested urban settings and remote rural locations. Pilot programs in Malawi, Thailand, and Iran have demonstrated significant improvements in response times and cost-efficiency with motorlance systems. This study presents a framework for motorlance operation and identifies three potential pilot locations: Mandaluyong, Smokey Mountain, and Iloilo City. Site visits, driver interviews, and user surveys indicate public trust in the motorlance concept and positive reception to potential motorlance deployment. Cost analysis verifies the financial feasibility of motorlance systems. Future work will focus on implementing a physical pilot in Mandaluyong, with the aim of expanding service to similar regions contingent on the Mandaluyong pilot's success.</description>

      <title>Future of Algorithmic Organization: Large-Scale Analysis of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) resemble early online communities, particularly those centered around open-source projects, and present a potential empirical framework for complex social-computing systems by encoding governance rules within "smart contracts" on the blockchain. A key function of a DAO is collective decision-making, typically carried out through a series of proposals where members vote on organizational events using governance tokens, signifying relative influence within the DAO. In just a few years, the deployment of DAOs surged with a total treasury of $24.5 billion and 11.1M governance token holders collectively managing decisions across over 13,000 DAOs as of 2024. In this study, we examine the operational dynamics of 100 DAOs, like pleasrdao, lexdao, lootdao, optimism collective, uniswap, etc. With large-scale empirical analysis of a diverse set of DAO categories and smart contracts and by leveraging on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data, we examine factors such as voting power, participation, and DAO characteristics dictating the level of decentralization, thus, the efficiency of management structures. As such, our study highlights that increased grassroots participation correlates with higher decentralization in a DAO, and lower variance in voting power within a DAO correlates with a higher level of decentralization, as consistently measured by Gini metrics. These insights closely align with key topics in political science, such as the allocation of power in decision-making and the effects of various governance models. We conclude by discussing the implications for researchers, and practitioners, emphasizing how these factors can inform the design of democratic governance systems in emerging applications that require active engagement from stakeholders in decision-making.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller estimates tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also minimizing risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for Uncovering Hidden Social Bots via Genetic Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms face an ongoing challenge in combating the proliferation of social bots, automated accounts that are also known to distort public opinion and support the spread of disinformation. Over the years, social bots have evolved greatly, often becoming indistinguishable from real users, and more recently, families of bots have been identified that are powered by Large Language Models to produce content for posting. We suggest an idea to classify social users as bots or not using genetic similarity algorithms. These algorithms provide an adaptive method for analyzing user behavior, allowing for the continuous evolution of detection criteria in response to the ever-changing tactics of social bots. Our proposal involves an initial clustering of social users into distinct macro species based on the similarities of their timelines. Macro species are then classified as either bot or genuine based on genetic characteristics. The preliminary idea we present, once fully developed, will allow existing detection applications based on timeline equality alone to be extended to detect bots. By incorporating new metrics, our approach will systematically classify non-trivial accounts into appropriate categories, effectively peeling back layers to reveal non-obvious species.</description>

      <title>Connect-while-in-range: modelling the impact of spatial constraints on dynamic communication network structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like other social animals and biological systems, human groups constantly exchange information. Network models provide a way of quantifying this process by representing the pathways of information propagation between individuals. Existing approaches to studying these networks largely hypothesize network formation to be a result of cognitive biases and choices about who to connect to. Observational data suggests, however, that physical proximity plays a major role in shaping the formation of communication networks in human groups. Here we report results from a series of agent-based simulations in which agents move around at random in a bounded 2D space and connect while within communication range. Comparing the results to a non-spatial model, we show how including spatial constraints impacts our predictions of network structure: ranged networks are more clustered, with slightly higher degree, higher average shortest path length, a lower number of connected components and a higher small-world index. We find two important drivers of network structure in range-constrained dynamic networks: communication range relative to environment size, and population density. These results show that neglecting spatial constraints in models of network formation makes a difference for predicted network structures. Our simulation model quantifies this part of the process of network formation, realized by simply situating individuals in an environment. The model also provides a tool to include spatial constraints in other models of human communication, as well as dynamic models of network formation more generally.</description>

      <title>Ads Supply Personalization via Doubly Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ads supply personalization aims to balance the revenue and user engagement, two long-term objectives in social media ads, by tailoring the ad quantity and density. In the industry-scale system, the challenge for ads supply lies in modeling the counterfactual effects of a conservative supply treatment (e.g., a small density change) over an extended duration. In this paper, we present a streamlined framework for personalized ad supply. This framework optimally utilizes information from data collection policies through the doubly robust learning. Consequently, it significantly improves the accuracy of long-term treatment effect estimates. Additionally, its low-complexity design not only results in computational cost savings compared to existing methods, but also makes it scalable for billion-scale applications. Through both offline experiments and online production tests, the framework consistently demonstrated significant improvements in top-line business metrics over months. The framework has been fully deployed to live traffic in one of the world's largest social media platforms.</description>

      <title>LLM Chain Ensembles for Scalable and Accurate Data Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot classification makes them viable solutions for data annotation in rapidly evolving domains where quality labeled data is often scarce and costly to obtain. However, the large-scale deployment of LLMs can be prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces an LLM chain ensemble methodology that aligns multiple LLMs in a sequence, routing data subsets to subsequent models based on classification uncertainty. This approach leverages the strengths of individual LLMs within a broader system, allowing each model to handle data points where it exhibits the highest confidence, while forwarding more complex cases to potentially more robust models. Our results show that the chain ensemble method often exceeds the performance of the best individual model in the chain and achieves substantial cost savings, making LLM chain ensembles a practical and efficient solution for large-scale data annotation challenges.</description>

      <title>Persistent Hierarchy in Contemporary International Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science is increasingly global, with international collaboration playing a crucial role in advancing scientific development and knowledge exchange across borders. However, the processes that regulate how scientific labor is distributed among countries remain underexplored, leading to challenges in ensuring both effective collaboration and equitable participation across diverse scientific communities. Here, we leverage three million internationally coauthored publications produced by countries worldwide to examine the division of scientific labor in international collaboration, identify the factors that shape this distribution, and assess its broader consequences. Our findings uncover a persistent hierarchical structure in international collaboration, with researchers from scientifically advanced countries tend to occupy leading roles, while those from less-developed countries are often relegated to supportive roles, even after controlling for various influential factors. This hierarchy is also reflected in the research content, as countries with lower scientific capacity tend to participate in international collaborations that deviate from their domestic science. By analyzing the labor division within international collaborations, we demonstrate that researchers from less-developed countries face systematic disadvantages, which not only limit their contributions to the global scientific community but also prevent them from fully benefiting from international collaborations.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Internet's Hidden Values: An Empirical Study of Desirable Behavior Using Highly-Upvoted Content on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major task for moderators of online spaces is norm-setting, essentially creating shared norms for user behavior in their communities. Platform design principles emphasize the importance of highlighting norm-adhering examples and explicitly stating community norms. However, norms and values vary between communities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for platforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable behavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches of detecting desirability are limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these measures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper, we use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability and conduct an analysis of highly-upvoted comments across 85 popular sub-communities on Reddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments and compile 97 $\textit{macro}$, $\textit{meso}$, and $\textit{micro}$ values based on their frequency across communities. Furthermore, we find that existing computational models for measuring prosociality were inadequate to capture 86 of the values we extracted. Finally, we show that our approach can not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior taxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in practice. This work has implications for improving moderator understanding of their community values, motivates the need for nuanced models of desirability beyond prosocial measures, and provides a framework that can supplement qualitative work with larger-scale content analyses.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation via Neural Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) is a hot topic in sequence-based user interest modeling, which aims at utilizing a single model to predict the next items for different domains. To tackle the CDSR, many methods are focused on domain overlapped users' behaviors fitting, which heavily relies on the same user's different-domain item sequences collaborating signals to capture the synergy of cross-domain item-item correlation. Indeed, these overlapped users occupy a small fraction of the entire user set only, which introduces a strong assumption that the small group of domain overlapped users is enough to represent all domain user behavior characteristics. However, intuitively, such a suggestion is biased, and the insufficient learning paradigm in non-overlapped users will inevitably limit model performance. Further, it is not trivial to model non-overlapped user behaviors in CDSR because there are no other domain behaviors to collaborate with, which causes the observed single-domain users' behavior sequences to be hard to contribute to cross-domain knowledge mining. Considering such a phenomenon, we raise a challenging and unexplored question: How to unleash the potential of non-overlapped users' behaviors to empower CDSR?</description>

      <title>An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin's scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra's algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by LND tend to be advantageous in terms of payment reliability, Eclair tends to result in paths with low fees, and that LDK exhibits average reliability with larger fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>The Strong Maximum Circulation Algorithm: A New Method for Aggregating Preference Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new optimization-based method for aggregating preferences in settings where each voter expresses preferences over pairs of alternatives. Our approach to identifying a consensus partial order is motivated by the observation that collections of votes that form a cycle can be treated as collective ties. Our approach then removes unions of cycles of votes, or circulations, from the vote graph and determines aggregate preferences from the remainder. Specifically, we study the removal of maximal circulations attained by any union of cycles the removal of which leaves an acyclic graph. We introduce the strong maximum circulation, the removal of which guarantees a unique outcome in terms of the induced partial order, called the strong partial order. The strong maximum circulation also satisfies strong complementary slackness conditions, and is shown to be solved efficiently as a network flow problem. We further establish the relationship between the dual of the maximum circulation problem and Kemeny's method, a popular optimization-based approach for preference aggregation. We also show that identifying a minimum maximal circulation -- i.e., a maximal circulation containing the smallest number of votes -- is an NP-hard problem. Further an instance of the minimum maximal circulation may have multiple optimal solutions whose removal results in conflicting partial orders.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bluesky is a new social network built upon the AT Protocol, a decentralized foundation for public social media. It was launched in private beta in February 2023, and has grown to over 10 million registered users by October 2024. In this paper we introduce the architecture of Bluesky and the AT Protocol, and explain how the technical design of Bluesky is informed by our goals: to enable decentralization by having multiple interoperable providers for every part of the system; to make it easy for users to switch providers; to give users agency over the content they see; and to provide a simple user experience that does not burden users with complexity arising from the system's decentralized nature. The system's openness allows anybody to contribute to content moderation and community management, and we invite the research community to use Bluesky as a dataset and testing ground for new approaches in social media moderation.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Agents for Collaborative Task under Information Asymmetry</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have achieved great progress in solving complex tasks. It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' collaborations are leveraged to perform multi-person tasks, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication toward effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.</description>

      <title>HC-GLAD: Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to its significance. Most existing methods that rely on traditional GNNs mainly consider pairwise relationships between first-order neighbors, which is insufficient to capture the complex high-order dependencies often associated with anomalies. This limitation underscores the necessity of exploring high-order node interactions in UGAD. In addition, most previous works ignore the underlying properties (e.g., hierarchy and power-law structure) which are common in real-world graph datasets and therefore are indispensable factors in the UGAD task. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (HC-GLAD in short). To exploit high-order node group information, we construct hypergraphs based on pre-designed gold motifs and subsequently perform hypergraph convolution. Furthermore, to preserve the hierarchy of real-world graphs, we introduce hyperbolic geometry into this field and conduct both graph and hypergraph embedding learning in hyperbolic space with the hyperboloid model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously apply hypergraph with node group information and hyperbolic geometry in this field. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets of different fields demonstrate the superiority of HC-GLAD on the UGAD task. The code is available at https://github.com/Yali-F/HC-GLAD.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic factors of national representation in the global film festival circuit: skewed toward the large and wealthy, but small countries can beat the odds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes how economic, demographic, and geographic factors predict the representation of different countries in the global film festival circuit. It relies on the combination of several open-access databases, including festival programming information from the Cinando platform of the Cannes Film Market. The dataset consists of over 20,000 unique films from almost 600 festivals across the world over a decade, a total of more than 30,000 film-festival entries. It is shown that while films from large affluent countries indeed dominate the festival screen, the bias is nevertheless not fully proportional to the large demographic and economic worldwide disparities and that several smaller countries perform better than expected. Further computational simulations demonstrate how much including films from smaller countries contributes to cultural diversity, and how countries vary in cultural "trade balance" dynamics, revealing differences between net exporters and importers of festival films. This research underscores the importance of representation in film festivals and the public value of increasing cultural diversity. The data-driven insights and quantitative approaches to festival programming and cultural event analytics are hoped to be useful for both the academic community as well as film festival organizers and policymakers aiming to foster more inclusive and diverse cultural landscapes.</description>
