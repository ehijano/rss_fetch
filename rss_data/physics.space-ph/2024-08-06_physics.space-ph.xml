      <title>Kinetic scales dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of fully kinetic 3D numerical simulations and observations in solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere that the transition from deterministic chaos to turbulence at kinetic (sub-ion) scales in space plasmas is generally dominated by magnetic helicity (an adiabatic invariant in a weakly dissipative plasma) directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the space observations in the frames of this approach.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the current systems in the Martian ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the solar wind interacts with the ionosphere of an unmagnetized planet, it induces currents that form an induced magnetosphere. These currents and their associated magnetic fields play a pivotal role in controlling the movement of charged particles, which is essential for understanding the escape of planetary ions. Unlike the well-documented magnetospheric current systems, the ionospheric current systems on unmagnetized planets remain less understood, which constrains the quantification of electrodynamic energy transfer from stars to these planets. Here, utilizing eight years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we investigate the global distribution of ionospheric currents on Mars. We have identified two distinct current systems in the ionosphere: one aligns with the solar wind electric field yet exhibits hemispheric asymmetry perpendicular to the electric field direction; the other corresponds to the flow pattern of annually-averaged neutral winds. We propose that these two current systems are driven by the solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds, respectively. Our findings reveal that Martian ionospheric dynamics are influenced by the neutral winds from below and the solar wind from above, highlighting the complex and intriguing nature of current systems on unmagnetized planets.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>
