      <title>Compared influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability and of spring soil moisture on summer heat waves in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study and compare the influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and of spring soil moisture in Southern Europe on the duration and intensity of European summer heat waves. We study common heat waves with return times of a few years like in previous studies, but we also propose a new methodological approach, return time maps, that allows us to study rare heat waves with return times from 10 to 50 years. We use the outputs from three climate models, namely IPSL-CM6A-LR, EC-Earth3, and CNRM-CM6-1, in which North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are restored towards the observed AMV anomalies. The three models give consistent results, with the exception of EC-Earth simulating a much greater influence of soil moisture. Typical AMV or spring soil moisture anomalies induce changes in the temperature and duration of heat waves that are of comparable amplitude, but follow different regional patterns. As might be expected, a positive AMV phase or low soil moisture induces hotter and longer typical heat waves over most of Europe. However, counter-intuitively, they also induce less heat wave days and cooler heat waves over part of Northeast Europe. For more extreme events, the influence of the AMV and soil moisture increase, according to rather similar regional patterns as for typical heat waves. However, while the amplitude of the influence is greater, the regions with decreased heat wave temperature and less heat wave days extend in size.</description>

      <title>Quantifying risk of a noise-induced AMOC collapse from northern and tropical Atlantic Ocean variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) exerts a major influence on global climate. There is much debate about whether the current strong AMOC may collapse as a result of anthropogenic forcing and/or internal variability. Increasing the noise in simple salt-advection models can change the apparent AMOC tipping threshold. However, it's not clear if 'present-day' variability is strong enough to induce a collapse. Here, we investigate how internal variability affects the likelihood of AMOC collapse. We examine internal variability of basin-scale salinities and temperatures in four CMIP6 pre-industrial simulations. We fit this to an empirical, process-based AMOC box model, and find that noise-induced AMOC collapse (defined as a decade in which the mean AMOC strength falls below 5 Sv) is unlikely for pre-industrial CMIP6 variability unless external forcing shifts the AMOC closer to a threshold. However, CMIP6 models seem to underestimate present-day Atlantic Ocean variability, and stronger variability substantially increases the likelihood of noise-induced collapse, especially if forcing brings the AMOC close to a stability threshold. Surprisingly, we find a case where forcing temporarily overshoots a stability threshold but noise decreases the probability of collapse. Accurately modelling internal decadal variability is essential for understanding the increased uncertainty in AMOC projections.</description>
