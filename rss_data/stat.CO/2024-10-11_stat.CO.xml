      <title>Cost-aware Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is the preferred framework for estimating parameters of intractable models in science and engineering. A significant challenge in this context is the large computational cost of simulating data from complex models, and the fact that this cost often depends on parameter values. We therefore propose \textit{cost-aware SBI methods} which can significantly reduce the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference.</description>

      <title>panelPomp: Analysis of Panel Data via Partially Observed Markov Processes in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Panel data arise when time series measurements are collected from multiple, dynamically independent but structurally related systems. In such cases, each system's time series can be modeled as a partially observed Markov process (POMP), and the ensemble of these models is called a PanelPOMP. If the time series are relatively short, statistical inference for each time series must draw information from across the entire panel. Every time series has a name, called its unit label, which may correspond to an object on which that time series was collected. Differences between units may be of direct inferential interest or may be a nuisance for studying the commonalities. The R package panelPomp supports analysis of panel data via a general class of PanelPOMP models. This includes a suite of tools for manipulation of models and data that take advantage of the panel structure. The panelPomp package currently emphasizes recent advances enabling likelihood-based inference via simulation-based algorithms. However, the general framework provided by panelPomp supports development of additional, new inference methodology for panel data.</description>

      <title>Smoothed pseudo-population bootstrap methods with applications to finite population quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces smoothed pseudo-population bootstrap methods for the purposes of variance estimation and the construction of confidence intervals for finite population quantiles. In an i.i.d. context, it has been shown that resampling from a smoothed estimate of the distribution function instead of the usual empirical distribution function can improve the convergence rate of the bootstrap variance estimator of a sample quantile. We extend the smoothed bootstrap to the survey sampling framework by implementing it in pseudo-population bootstrap methods for high entropy, single-stage survey designs, such as simple random sampling without replacement and Poisson sampling. Given a kernel function and a bandwidth, it consists of smoothing the pseudo-population from which bootstrap samples are drawn using the original sampling design. Given that the implementation of the proposed algorithms requires the specification of the bandwidth, we develop a plug-in selection method along with a grid search selection method based on a bootstrap estimate of the mean squared error. Simulation results suggest a gain in efficiency associated with the smoothed approach as compared to the standard pseudo-population bootstrap for estimating the variance of a quantile estimator together with mixed results regarding confidence interval coverage.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial in relation to the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interacting particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Neural Methods for Amortized Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based methods for statistical inference have evolved dramatically over the past 50 years, keeping pace with technological advancements. The field is undergoing a new revolution as it embraces the representational capacity of neural networks, optimization libraries and graphics processing units for learning complex mappings between data and inferential targets. The resulting tools are amortized, in the sense that, after an initial setup cost, they allow rapid inference through fast feed-forward operations. In this article we review recent progress in the context of point estimation, approximate Bayesian inference, summary-statistic construction, and likelihood approximation. We also cover software, and include a simple illustration to showcase the wide array of tools available for amortized inference and the benefits they offer over Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The article concludes with an overview of relevant topics and an outlook on future research directions.</description>

      <title>Control, Transport and Sampling: Towards Better Loss Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging connections between diffusion-based sampling, optimal transport, and stochastic optimal control through their shared links to the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, we propose novel objective functions that can be used to transport $\nu$ to $\mu$, consequently sample from the target $\mu$, via optimally controlled dynamics. We highlight the importance of the pathwise perspective and the role various optimality conditions on the path measure can play for the design of valid training losses, the careful choice of which offer numerical advantages in implementation. Basing the formalism on Schr\"odinger bridge comes with the additional practical capability of baking in inductive bias when it comes to Neural Network training.</description>

      <title>Fast leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation using clustered Network Information Criterion (NICc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For prediction models developed on clustered data that do not account for cluster heterogeneity in model parameterization, it is crucial to use cluster-based validation to assess model generalizability on unseen clusters. This paper introduces a clustered estimator of the Network Information Criterion (NICc) to approximate leave-one-cluster-out deviance for standard prediction models with twice differentiable log-likelihood functions. The NICc serves as a fast alternative to cluster-based cross-validation. Stone (1977) proved that the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is asymptotically equivalent to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation for true parametric models with independent and identically distributed observations. Ripley (1996) noted that the Network Information Criterion (NIC), derived from Stone's proof, is a better approximation when the model is misspecified. For clustered data, we derived NICc by substituting the Fisher information matrix in the NIC with a clustering-adjusted estimator. The NICc imposes a greater penalty when the data exhibits stronger clustering, thereby allowing the NICc to better prevent over-parameterization. In a simulation study and an empirical example, we used standard regression to develop prediction models for clustered data with Gaussian or binomial responses. Compared to the commonly used AIC and BIC for standard regression, NICc provides a much more accurate approximation to leave-one-cluster-out deviance and results in more accurate model size and variable selection, as determined by cluster-based cross-validation, especially when the data exhibit strong clustering.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point system with single-input single-output (SISO) for communication and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) for sensing within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We consider the optimal rate-distortion (R-D) region and explore several inner (IB) and outer bounds (OB). We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. As the number of sensing antennas increases, these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB). We also establish that the achievable rate-Cram\'er-Rao bound (R-CRB) serves as an OB for the optimal C-D region, valid for both unbiased estimators and asymptotically large numbers of receive antennas. To clarify that the input distribution determines the tradeoff across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: i) an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method, and ii) a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach. The CF approach includes a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we adapt and refine the deterministic-random tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>BNEM: A Boltzmann Sampler Based on Bootstrapped Noised Energy Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing an efficient sampler capable of generating independent and identically distributed (IID) samples from a Boltzmann distribution is a crucial challenge in scientific research, e.g. molecular dynamics. In this work, we intend to learn neural samplers given energy functions instead of data sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. By learning the energies of the noised data, we propose a diffusion-based sampler, Noised Energy Matching, which theoretically has lower variance and more complexity compared to related works. Furthermore, a novel bootstrapping technique is applied to NEM to balance between bias and variance. We evaluate NEM and BNEM on a 2-dimensional 40 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and a 4-particle double-well potential (DW-4). The experimental results demonstrate that BNEM can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more robust.</description>
