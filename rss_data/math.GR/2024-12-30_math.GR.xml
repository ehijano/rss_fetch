      <title>A remark on the number of automorphisms of finite abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Ab_0$ be the class of finite abelian groups and consider the function $f:Ab_0\longrightarrow(0,\infty)$ given by $f(G)=\frac{|{\rm Aut}(G)|}{|G|}$\,, where ${\rm Aut}(G)$ is the automorphism group of a finite abelian group $G$. In this short note, we prove that the image of $f$ is a dense set in $[0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Compressible subgroups and simplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we give sufficient conditions for a group to have simple derived subgroup; the argument is based on generalising properties observed for extremely proximal micro-supported actions on the Cantor space, and generalises previous results of Matui, Le Boudec and others in this direction. We give a sufficient condition for a non-trivial normal subgroup (not assumed closed) of a locally compact group $G$ to be open, also based on the theory of micro-supported actions. This shows in particular that many of the class of robustly monolithic groups introduced by Caprace--Reid--Wesolek are simple-by-discrete.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent groups, solvable groups and factorizable inverse monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper subcentral (resp., central) idempotent series and composition subcentral (resp., central) idempotent series in an inverse semigroup are introduced and investigated. It is shown that if $S=EG$ is a factorizable inverse monoids with semilattice $E$ of idempotents and the group $G$ of units such that the natural connection $\theta$ is a dual isomorphism from $E$ to a sublattice of $L(G)$, then any two composition subcentral (resp., central) idempotent series in $S$ are isomorphic. It may be considered as an appropriate analogue in semigroup theory of Jordan-H\"{o}lder Theorem in group theory. Based on this,$G$-nilpotent and $G$-solvable inverse monoids are also introduced and studies. Some characterizations of the coset monoid of nilpotent groups and solvable groups are given. This extends the main result in Semigroup Forum 20: 255-267, 1980 and also provides another effective approach for the study of nilpotent and solvable groups. Finally, some open problems related to nilpotent and solvable groups are translated to semigroup theory, which may be helpful for us to solve these open problems.</description>

      <title>A group and the completion of its coset semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\cal K}_1(G)$ denote the inverse subsemigroup of ${\cal K}(G)$ consisting of all right cosets of all non-trivial subgroups of $G$. This paper concentrates on the study of the group $\Sigma({\cal K}_1(G))$ of all units of the completion of ${\cal K}_1(G)$. The characterizations and the representations of $\Sigma({\cal K}_1(G))$ are given when $G$ is a periodic group whose minimal subgroups permute with each other. Based on these, for such groups $G$ except some special $p$-groups, it is shown that $G$ and its coset semigroup ${\cal K}_1(G)$ are uniquely determined by each other, up to isomorphism. This extends the related results obtained by Schein in 1973.</description>

      <title>All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the importance of unitarity in quantum physics, work on the representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case, which necessarily means infinite dimensional matrices for this non-compact group. Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or anti-Hermitian. The complete classification of all such irreducible representations is found and their matrix elements specified. These irreducible representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous Lorentz sub-algebra and consisting of direct sums of the finite irreps of the homogeneous Lorentz algebra (HLA). Only two types of such backbones arise (see 5.1a,b herein). Consequently, only certain dimensions of representation are possible, namely 4, 5, 10, 14, 20, 30, 35, 55, 56, 91, etc or generally either 1/6 N(N+1)(N+2) or 1/6 N(N+1)(2N+1) where N=2,3,4,etc is the number of HLA irreps in the backbone (minimum 2). The two Casimir invariants can be specified in terms of a single integral or half-integral parameter, p. For irreps based on (5.1a), -C1=p(p+1)-2 and C2=0 with p taking values 2,3,4,etc. For irreps based on (5.1b), -C1=2(p^2-1) and -C2= p^2 (p^2-1) with p taking values 3/2,2,5/2,3,etc. These correspond to the same expressions found for the unitary representations, -C1=p(p+1)+(q+1)(q-2) and -C2=p(p+1)q(q-1) with q=0 and q=p respectively for the two types of irrep. There is thus a far more restricted set of finite irreps with Hermitian or anti-Hermitian generators than for the discrete infinite dimensional unitary irreps. The corresponding irreps of the anti-de Sitter group follow immediately from the replacement of the 4-momentum operators from V to iV.</description>

      <title>Cartesian subgroups in graph products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel of the natural projection of a graph product of groups onto their direct product is called the Cartesian subgroup. This construction generalises commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups. Using theory of polyhedral products, we give a lower and an upper bound on the number of relations in presentations of Cartesian groups and on their deficiency. The bounds are related to the fundamental groups of full subcomplexes in the clique complex, and the lower bound coincide with the upper bound if these fundamental groups are free or free abelian.
  Following Li Cai's approach, we also describe an algorithm that computes "small" presentations of Cartesian subgroups.</description>

      <title>Arc-transitive maps with edge number coprime to the Euler characteristic -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is one of a series of papers which aim towards a classification of edge-transitive maps of which the Euler characteristic and the edge number are coprime. This one establishes a framework and carries out the classification work for arc-transitive maps with solvable automorphism groups, which illustrates how the edge number impacts on the Euler characteristic for maps. The classification is involved with the constructions of various new and interesting arc-regular maps.</description>

      <title>On character values of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use vertex operator techniques to compute character values on unipotent classes of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. By realizing the Grothendieck ring $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq0}^\infty R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as Fock spaces, we formulate the Murnanghan-Nakayama rule of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ between Schur functions colored by an orbit $\phi$ of linear characters of $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$ under the Frobenius automorphism on and modified Hall-Littlewood functions colored by $f_1=t-1$, which provides detailed information on the character table of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. As applications, we use vertex algebraic methods to determine the Steinberg characters of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$, which were previously determined by Curtis-Lehrer-Tits via geometry of homology groups of spherical buildings and Springer-Zelevinsky utilizing Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Weak lumping of left-invariant random walks on left cosets of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. The left-invariant random walk driven by a probability measure $w$ on $G$ is the Markov chain in which from any state $x \in G$, the probability of stepping to $xg \in G$ is $w(g)$. The initial state is chosen randomly according to a given distribution. The walk is said to lump weakly on left cosets if the induced process on $G/H$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain. We characterise all the initial distributions and weights $w$ such that the walk is irreducible and lumps weakly on left cosets, and determine all the possible transition matrices of the induced Markov chain. In the case where $H$ is abelian we refine our main results to give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak lumping by an explicit system of linear equations on $w$, organized by the double cosets $HxH$. As an application we consider shuffles of a deck of $n$ cards such that repeated observations of the top card form a Markov chain. Such shuffles include the random-to-top shuffle, and also, when the deck is started in a uniform random order, the top-to-random shuffle. We give a further family of examples in which our full theory of weak lumping is needed to verify that the top card sequence is Markov.</description>

      <title>Invariance of non-vanishing of first $l^p$-cohomology under $L^q$-Measured Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05991</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.05991v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first $l^p$-cohomology is an algebro-analytical object attached to a finitely generated discrete group and introduced by M. Gromov. It is well known that it is invariant under quasi-isometry. In this article, we prove that the non-vanishing of the first $l^p$-cohomology of a non-amenable group is invariant under $L^q$-Measured Equiavalence (an equivalence relation introduced by Gromov), where $q\geq p$. We also discuss many applications of this result. We prove that for hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) Coxeter groups with boundaries having Combinatorial Loewner Property, conformal dimension (of the canonical conformal gauge) of the Gromov boundary is invariant under $L^q$-Measured Equivalence for some large $q$. We prove that the finitely generated free groups and surface groups are not $L^1$-Measured Equivalent. We also give a lower bound of the critical exponent for the first $l^p$-cohomology of any lattice in $SO(n,1)$. Finally, we discuss $L^q$-Measured Equivalence between non-amenable 3-manifold groups corresponding to Thurston's three geometries $\mathbb{H}^3$, $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\widetilde{SL_2(\mathbb{R})}$.</description>

      <title>Branch groups with infinite rigid kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical framework is established for explicitly calculating rigid kernels of self-similar regular branch groups. This is applied to a new infinite family of branch groups in order to provide the first examples of self-similar, branch groups with infinite rigid kernel. The groups are analogs of the Hanoi Towers group on 3 pegs, based on the standard actions of finite dihedral groups on regular polygons with odd numbers of vertices, and the rigid kernel is an infinite Cartesian power of the cyclic group of order 2, except for the original Hanoi group. The proofs rely on a symbolic-dynamical approach, related to finitely constrained groups.</description>

      <title>Intersecting subsets in finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be transitive, and let $S$ be an intersecting subset, namely, the ratio $xy^{-1}$ of any elements $x,y\in S$ fixes some point. An EKR-type problem is to characterize transitive groups $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ such that any intersecting set is upper bounded by $|G_\omega|$, where $\omega\in\Omega$. A nice result of Meagher-Spiga-Tiep (2016) tells us that if $G$ is 2-transitive, then indeed $|S|\leqslant|G_\omega|$. A natural next step would be to explore intersecting subsets for primitive groups and quasiprimitive groups. Our study in this paper shows that for quasiprimitive permutation groups, the size $|S|$ can be arbitrarily larger than $|G_\omega|$. We conjecture that for quasiprimitve groups, the upperbound for $|S|$ is $O(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2})$. As a starting point, we prove that ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})\leqslant{\sqrt2/2}$ for all quasiprimitive actions of the Suzuki groups $G=\mathrm{Sz}(q)$. To show that our conjectured upper bound is tight, we provide examples of groups for which ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})$ is arbitrarily close to ${\sqrt2/2}$. As far as general transitive groups concerned, infinity families of examples produced show that the ratio ${|S|/(|G_\omega||\Omega|^{1\over2}})$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>An extension of the cogrowth formula to arbitrary subsets of the tree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the probability that a random walk in the free group ends in a proper power? Or in a primitive element? We present a formula that computes the exponential decay rate of the probability that a random walk on a regular tree ends in a given subset, in terms of the exponential decay rate of the analogous probability of the non-backtracking random walk. This generalizes the well-known cogrowth formula of Grigorchuk, Cohen and Northshield. We also extend the formula to arbitrary subsets of the biregular tree.</description>

Abstract: In the paper we study irreducible representations of some nilpotent groups of finite abelian total rank. The main result of the paper states that if a torsion-free minimax group $G$ of nilpotency class 2 admits a faithful irreducible representation $\varphi $ over a finitely generated field $k$ such that $chark \notin Sp(G)$ then there exist a subgroup $N$ and an irreducible primitive representation $\psi $ of the subgroup $N$ over $k$ such that the representation $\varphi $ is induced from $\psi $ and the quotient group $N/Ker\psi $ is finitely generated.</description>
