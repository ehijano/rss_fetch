      <title>Robust orbital-angular-momentum-based underwater acoustic communication with dynamic modal decomposition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, acoustic communication employing Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) opens another avenue for efficient data transmission in aquatic environments. Current topological charge (TC) detection of OAM beams relies on the orthogonality among different-order OAM beams. Such strategy requires data collection from the entire acoustic field, which inevitably reduces the efficiency and increases the bit error rate (BER). To address these challenges, this study proposes a modified Dynamic Modal Decomposition (DMD) method by partially sampling the acoustic field for precise TC detection. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of this approach in extracting single or multiple TCs magnitudes within a partially-sampled acoustic field. We theoretically compare the performance of the modified DMD approach with conventional orthogonal decoding method. Simulation results indicate that our modified DMD scheme exhibits lower BER under the same noise interference and is more robust to the array misalignment. This research introduces an efficient demodulation solution for acoustic OAM communication, offering potential benefits for simplifying receiver array design and enhancing long-distance underwater data transmission.</description>

      <title>Hall Transport of Charged Particles in Magnetic Disk Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of periodic structures has driven the development of advanced materials like photonic and phononic crystals. These metamaterials typically rely on complex repeating units or meta-atoms, limiting their adaptability after fabrication. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of metafields, which are repeating patterns of local magnetic fields instead of material structures. Unlike metamaterials, which consist of atoms arranged in structured patterns, metafields focus on the patterns of fields alone, allowing for dynamic property adjustments through external electric currents. This study explores a specific metafield where the repeating pattern is the magnetic disk (MD), defined by a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to its surface. By arranging multiple MDs, we form a magnetic disk array (MDA) and theoretically investigate the charged particle dynamics within this array. Our analysis highlights Hall transport phenomena, such as Hall diffusivity, conductivity, and thermal Hall effects. Using complex variables, we derive the collision integral and Boltzmann equation for particle distribution, applying perturbation methods and Fourier analysis to calculate transport coefficients. Simulations reveal a one-way preferential diffusion at the interface between MDAs with opposing field directions, where diffusion intensity varies with the particle movement direction. This highlights metafields' potential for dynamic particle control applications.</description>

      <title>Advanced crack tip stress analysis using interaction integrals in high-resolution digital image correlation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The link between microscopic mechanisms and macroscopic behaviour, represented by the $da/dN-\Delta K$ curve, plays an increasingly important role in relating the fatigue crack growth curve required for component design to the underlying physics. High-resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC) allows for in-depth analysis of microscopic fatigue crack growth mechanisms, but is rarely used to determine the SIF of the crack tip. This paper examines the applicability of the interaction integral in HR-DIC data and identifies factors that should be considered when evaluating the integral results.
  A major influence is the integration near the PZ, which leads to an erroneous increase in the calculated SIF result. In addition, the large integration path gaps required in HR-DIC around the crack path significantly hinder accurate results. The effect of the crack face contact is overall small. While it slightly increases the SIF result, it does not correlate with the crack opening load $K_\mathrm{op}$.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time-modulated systems have attracted significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways. Here, we introduce a new type of space-time-modulated structure, the space-time wedge, consisting of two interfaces moving at different velocities, which results in either closing or opening wedges. Using moving boundary conditions, we derive closed-form solutions for the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a wedge and leverage these solutions to unveil the underlying physics, including multiple space-time scattering and Doppler shifting. The space-time wedge holds potential for various optical and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Giant Seebeck Effect in PEDOT Materials with Molecular Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) has been attracting attention as a thermoelectric material for room-temperature use due to its flexibility and non-toxicity. However, PEDOT reportedly generates insufficient thermoelectric power for practical use. This work tried to improve the Seebeck coefficient by introducing molecular strain to PEDOT molecules by loading a Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-free PEDOT on a Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) fiber. Raman spectroscopy revealed the PEDOT materials with significant compression in the C{\alpha}-C{\alpha} bond and extension in the C{\alpha}=C\b{eta} bond exhibit Seebeck coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than usual. Furthermore, strain in the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} bond strongly correlated with the Seebeck coefficient that varied in a broad range from -2100 to 3300 {\mu}V K-1. This variation indicated that the molecular strain formed a sharp peak or valley around the Fermi level in the density of state (DOS) function, which gradually shifts along with the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} strain. This molecular strain-induced giant Seebeck effect is expected to be an applicable technique for other polythiophene molecules.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light-matter coupling with electric fields in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can enhance light-matter coupling in quantum wells through the quantum-confined Stark effect, by enabling a reduction in well width without shifting the emission to shorter wavelengths. We illustrate this with the paradigmatic example of red-emitting (644 nm-698 nm) AlInGaN heterostructures, which are essential for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels. By systematically exploring their design space with machine learning, we uncover that the globally optimal designs feature extreme internal electric fields exceeding 8 MV/cm. Structural and compositional engineering of electric fields not only offers precise control over the emission wavelength but also boosts the light-emission probability by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity in Niobium oxides: A pathway to mitigate Two-Level System Defects in Niobium 3D Resonator for quantum applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials imperfections in Nniobium based superconducting quantum circuits, in particular, two-level-system (TLS) defects, are a major source of decoherence, ultimately limiting the performance of quantum computation and sensing. Thus, identifying and understanding the microscopic origin of possible TLS defects in these devices and developing strategies to eliminate them is key to superconducting qubit performance improvement. In this paper, we demonstrate the reduction of two-level system losses in three-dimensional superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium resonators by a 10-hour high vacuum (HV) heat treatment at 650{\deg}C, even after exposure to air and high pressure rinsing (HPR). By probing the effect of this annealing on niobium samples using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we witness an alteration of the native oxide composition re-grown after air exposure and HPR and the creation of nano-scale crystalline oxide regions, which correlates with the measured tenfold quality factor enhancement at low fields of the 1.3 GHz niobium resonator.</description>

      <title>Diffuse laser illumination for Maxwellian view Doppler holography of the retina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the benefits of using diffuse illumination in laser holography for ophthalmic applications. Integrating a diffusing element introduces angular diversity in the optical radiation and reduces spatial coherence, effectively distributing the illumination beam's energy across the focal plane of the eyepiece. This configuration allows for an expanded field of view in digitally computed retinal images, as the eyepiece can be positioned closer to the cornea to achieve a Maxwellian view of the retina without compromising ocular safety. By avoiding the formation of a laser hot spot near the cornea, diffuse illumination facilitates easier compliance with American and European safety standards for ophthalmic devices. Importantly, this approach does not introduce any adverse effects on digitally computed Doppler images.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength DFB Laser Based on Sidewall Third Order Four Phase-Shifted Sampled Bragg Grating with Uniform Wavelength Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a 1550 nm multi-wavelength distributed feedback (MW-DFB) laser employing a third-order, four-phase-shifted sampled sidewall grating. By utilizing linearly chirped sampled gratings and incorporating multiple true {\pi}-phase shifts within the cavity, we achieved and experimentally validated a four-wavelength laser with a channel spacing of 0.4 nm. The device operates stably and uniformly across a wide range of injection currents from 280 mA to 350 mA. The average wavelength spacing was measured at 0.401 nm with a standard deviation of 0.0081 nm. Additionally, we demonstrated a 0.3 nm MW-DFB laser with a seven-channel output, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.274 nm and a standard deviation of 0.0055 nm. This MW-DFB laser features a ridge waveguide with sidewall gratings, requiring only one metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) step and a single III-V material etching process. This streamlined fabrication approach simplifies device manufacturing and is well-suited for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems.</description>
