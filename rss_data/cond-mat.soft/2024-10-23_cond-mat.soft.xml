      <title>Tuning the buckling sequences of metamaterials using plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material nonlinearities such as hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity, and plasticity have recently emerged as design paradigms for metamaterials based on buckling. These metamaterials exhibit properties such as shape morphing, transition waves, and sequential deformation. In particular, plasticity has been used in the design of sequential metamaterials which combine high stiffness, strength, and dissipation at low density and produce superior shock absorbing performances. However, the use of plasticity for tuning buckling sequences in metamaterials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce yield area, yield criterion, and loading history as new design tools of plasticity in tuning the buckling load and sequence in metamaterials. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate a controllable buckling sequence in different metamaterial architectures with the above three strategies. Our findings enrich the toolbox of plasticity in the design of metamaterials with more controllable sequential deformations and leverage plasticity to broader applications in multi-functional metamaterials, high-performance soft robotics, and mechanical self-assembly.</description>

      <title>Tunable Crystalline Order and Growth Kinetics in 2D Binary Colloidal Self-assembly Driven by Depletion Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional crystal assemblies formed by a binary mixture of colloidal particles with a size ratio of 0.88 and driven by short-ranged depletion interactions. Our experiments show that the orientational order of the assembly decreases with an increasing fraction of impurity particles, reaching up to 18% reduction in a 1:1 binary mixture compared to a monodisperse suspension. We observe slower growth rate and arrested dynamics in the binary mixture, whereas the monodisperse sample follows a two-step nucleation and growth mechanism. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the minimum energy states for different size ratios and number ratios of the binary mixture. The simulation results predict a compromised translational order but sustained orientational order in a binary mixture with a size ratio as high as 0.88. From the combined experimental and numerical results, we conclude that the disordered assemblies found in a binary mixture originate from the frustration in assembly kinetics rather than topological frustration when there is a marginal mismatch between the two particle sizes.</description>

      <title>Single particle tracking of polymer aggregates inside disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16776v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>

      <title>Structure, dynamics and phase transitions in electric field assembled colloidal crystals and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-induced assembly of colloidal particles into structures of desired configurations is extremely relevant from the viewpoint of producing field-assembled micro-swimmers and reconfigurable smart materials. However, the behaviour of colloidal particles under the influence of alternating current (AC) electric fields remains a topic of ongoing investigation due to the complex effects of various control parameters. Here we examine the role of several factors including particle size, zeta potential, voltage and frequency of the applied field in the formation of different structural configurations ranging from crystals to glasses, and observe interesting and unexpected behaviours in the structure formation. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of structure formation; the nature of diffusion and active motion in these out-of-equilibrium systems, and show how that leads to the formation of close-packed or open structures. Lastly, we investigate the frequency-driven disorder-order-disorder phase transition in colloidal crystals, which is a starting point for building reconfigurable systems. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the significant roles of various factors in electric field-induced assembly of colloidal particles, as well as pave the way for potential applications in micro-robotics and next-generation materials.</description>

      <title>Salt solutions with two or more salts generate ion currents analogous to magnetic field lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gradient of a single salt in a solution generates an electric field, but not a current. Recent theoretical work by one of us [Phys. Rev. Lett. 24, 248004 (2020)] showed that the Nernst-Planck equations imply that crossed gradients of two or more different salts generate ion currents. These currents in solution have associated non-local electric fields. Particle motion driven by these non-local fields has recently been observed in experiment by Williams et al. [Phys. Rev. Fluids 9, 014201 (2024)]; a phenomenon which was dubbed action-at-a-distance diffusiophoresis. Here we use a magnetostatic analogy to show that in the far-field limit, these non-local currents and electric fields both have the functional form of the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole, decaying as r^(-d) in d = 2 and d = 3 dimensions. These long-ranged electric fields are generated entirely within solutions and have potential practical applications since they can drive both electrophoretic motion of particles, and electro-osmotic flows. The magnetostatic analogy also allows us to import tools and ideas from classical electromagnetism, into the study of multicomponent salt solutions.</description>

      <title>Chirality induced phase separation in active circle swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many microswimmers are inherently chiral, and this chirality can introduce fascinating behaviors in a collection of microswimmers. The dynamics become even more intriguing when two types of microswimmers with distinct chirality are mixed. Our study considers a mixture of self-propelled particles with opposite chirality, examining how the system characteristics evolve as the magnitude of chirality is tuned. In weakly chiral systems, the particles exhibit similar behavior, leading to a globally flocking phase where both types of particles are well mixed. However, in an intermediate range of chirality, the particles demix and follow their trajectories, creating a competition between chirality and self-propulsion. This competition results in interesting phases within the system. We explore the characteristics of these different phases in detail, focusing on the roles of self-propulsion speed and chirality.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behavior of non-idealized Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. Using a beam element simulator, we systematically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Attraction of Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs), it is often claimed that the rapid thermal fluctuations of their magnetic moments negates the magnetic dipolar attraction, hence preventing aggregation in liquid suspension. However we find that this is a misconception. Using Langevin dynamics, we simulate SMNP pairs and the dimer clusters they form which is the simplest case of aggregation. To quantify the tendency to aggregate, we introduce the dimer debonding time and calculate the average magnetic force of attraction which results from correlations in the fluctuating moments. Neither quantity has any dependence on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which determines the rate of superparamagnetic reversals, and comparing with computed N\'eel relaxation times we show that this holds for both blocked and superparamagnetic particles. These results imply that the phenomenon of superparamagnetism does not affect aggregation. Because the key dimensionless parameter for the N\'eel relaxation of a lone SMNP and the one for magnetic attraction have the same size and temperature scaling, there is a strong correlation between superparamagnetism and colloidal stability, as observed experimentally, but no causal relation.</description>

      <title>Modulating outcomes of oil drops bursting at a water-air interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that capillary waves generated by bursting of an oil drop at the water-air interface produces a daughter droplet inside the bath while part of it floats above it. Successive bursting events produce next generations of daughter droplets, gradually diminishing in size until the entire volume of oil rests atop the water-air interface. In this work, we demonstrate two different ways to modulate this process by modifying the constitution of the drop. Firstly, we introduce hydrophilic clay particles inside the parent oil drop and show that it arrests the cascade of daughter droplet generation preventing it from floating over the water-air interface. Secondly, we show that bursting behavior can be modified by a compound water-oil-air interface made of a film of oil with finite thickness and design a regime map which displays each of these outcomes. We underpin both of these demonstrations by theoretical arguments providing criteria to predict outcomes resulting therein. Lastly, all our scenarios have a direct relation to control of oil-water separation and stability of emulsified solutions in a wide variety of applications which include drug delivery, enhanced oil recovery, oil spills and food processing where a dispersed oil phase tries to separate from a continuous phase.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of Binary Nanocrystal Superlattices and the Relevance of Short-Range Attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs) enables the targeted integration of orthogonal physical properties, like photoluminescence and magnetism, into a single superstructure, unlocking a vast design space for multifunctional materials. Yet, the formation mechanism of BNSLs remains poorly understood, restricting the use of simulation to predict the structure and properties of the superlattices. Here, we use a combination of in situ scattering and molecular simulation to elucidate the self-assembly of two common BNSLs through emulsion templating. Our self-assembly experiments reveal that no intermediate structures precede the formation of the final binary phases, indicating that their formation proceeds through classical nucleation. Using simulations, we find that, despite the formation of AlB2 and NaZn13 typically being attributed to entropy, their self-assembly is most consistent with the nanocrystals possessing short-range interparticle attraction, which we find can dramatically accelerate nucleation kinetics in BNSLs. We also find homogenous, classical nucleation in simulation, corroborating our experiments. These results establish a robust correspondence between experiment and theory, paving the way towards a priori prediction of BNSLs.</description>

      <title>Correlations between two vortices in dry active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown that wet active matter may form synchronized rotating vortices in a square lattice, similar to an antiferromagnetic Ising model (by considering rotation direction as spin projections). In this letter, we investigate whether such a correlated state occurs for a model of dry active matter. We achieve that by numerically simulating the dynamics of a system of active particles in the presence of two identical circular obstacles. Then, we measure the rotation velocity correlation function of both vortices as a function of the obstacle diameter, their shortest separation, called gap, and the particle density. We find that, like the observations of vortex formation in wet active matter, both vortices can synchronize their rotations in either opposite or in the same direction; we call such regimes as antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, respectively. We show that, for the antiferromagnetic case, both vortices keep their motion correlated by exchanging particles through the region in between them, analogously to synchronized cogs; on the other hand, for the ferromagnetic regime, both vortices merge in a single rotating cluster, similar to a belt strapped around the obstacles. Additionallly, we observe the emergence of uncorrelated states at the transition between correlated states, in which only a single vortex is present, or in the large gap regime, in which the vortices are nearly independent on each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an active, stochastic microscopic model of particles suspended in a fluid and show that the coarse-grained description of this model renders odd viscoelasticity. The particles are odd dumbbells, each featuring a robotic device as the bead, which exhibits a particular torque response. We show that this model can be macroscopically treated as a viscoelastic fluid, analytically calculate the coefficients of the corresponding viscoelastic model, and corroborate the results using molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a unified analytical framework for several experimental and numerical setups designed to elucidate odd effects in fluids.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic swelling of stiff hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that stiff polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively swell (dilate) when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a volumetric diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. Upon shearing, we observed an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain, and persisted for hours. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all stiff hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin dynamics for single beads in linear elastic network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear elastic networks. In particular, the derivations of the GLEs are conducted without employing normal modes, resulting in two distinct representations in terms of resistance and mobility kernels. The fluctuation-dissipation relations are also confirmed for both GLEs. Subsequently, we demonstrate that these two representations are interconnected via Laplace transforms. Furthermore, another GLE is derived by utilizing a projection operator method, and it is shown that the equation obtained through the projection scheme is consistent with the GLE with the resistance kernel. As simple examples, the general theory is applied to the Rouse model and the ring polymer, where the GLEs with the resistance and mobility kernels are explicitly derived for arbitrary positions of the tagged bead in these models. Finally, the GLE with the mobility kernel is also derived for the elastic network with hydrodynamic interactions under the pre-averaging approximation.</description>

Abstract: The mammalian cell membrane is embedded with biomolecular condensates of protein and lipid clusters, which interact with an underlying viscoelastic cytoskeleton network to organize the cell surface and mechanically interact with the extracellular environment. However, the mechanical and thermodynamic interplay between the viscoelastic network and liquid-liquid phase separation of 2-dimensional (2D) lipid condensates remains poorly understood. Here, we engineer materials composed of 2D lipid membrane condensates embedded within a thin viscoelastic actin network. The network generates localized anisotropic stresses that deform lipid condensates into triangular morphologies with sharp edges and corners, shapes unseen in 3D composite gels. Kinetic coarsening of phase-separating lipid condensates accelerates the viscoelastic relaxation of the network, leading to an effectively softer composite material over intermediate timescales. We dynamically manipulate the membrane composition to control the elastic-to-viscous crossover of the network. Such viscoelastic composite membranes may enable the development of coatings, catalytic surfaces, separation membranes, and other interfaces with tunable spatial organization and plasticity mechanisms.</description>
