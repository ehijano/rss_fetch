      <title>Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a state-of-the-art weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.</description>

      <title>Floor-Plan-aided Indoor Localization: Zero-Shot Learning Framework, Data Sets, and Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been considered a promising approach for indoor localization. Nevertheless, the sample efficiency, scalability, and generalization ability remain open issues of implementing learning-based algorithms in practical systems. In this paper, we establish a zero-shot learning framework that does not need real-world measurements in a new communication environment. Specifically, a graph neural network that is scalable to the number of access points (APs) and mobile devices (MDs) is used for obtaining coarse locations of MDs. Based on the coarse locations, the floor-plan image between an MD and an AP is exploited to improve localization accuracy in a floor-plan-aided deep neural network. To further improve the generalization ability, we develop a synthetic data generator that provides synthetic data samples in different scenarios, where real-world samples are not available. We implement the framework in a prototype that estimates the locations of MDs. Experimental results show that our zero-shot learning method can reduce localization errors by around $30$\% to $55$\% compared with three baselines from the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Waveform Design for Multi-User and Multi-Target MIMO-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) opens up new service possibilities for sixth-generation (6G) systems, where both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) functionalities co-exist by sharing the same hardware platform and radio resource. In this paper, we investigate the waveform design problem in a downlink multi-user and multi-target ISAC system under different C&amp;S performance preferences. The multi-user interference (MUI) may critically degrade the communication performance. To eliminate the MUI, we employ the constructive interference mechanism into the ISAC system, which saves the power budget for communication. However, due to the conflict between C&amp;S metrics, it is intractable for the ISAC system to achieve the optimal performance of C&amp;S objective simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to strike a tradeoff between C&amp;S objectives. By virtue of the multi-objective optimization theory, we propose a weighted Tchebycheff-based transformation method to re-frame the C&amp;S trade-off problem as a Pareto-optimal problem, thus effectively tackling the constraints in ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results reveal the trade-off relation between C&amp;S performances, which provides insights for the flexible waveform design under different C&amp;S performance preferences in MIMO-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Communications in Near-Filed ISCAP Systems with Extremely Large-Scale Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates secure communications in a near-field multi-functional integrated sensing, communication, and powering (ISCAP) system with an extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) equipped at the base station (BS). In this system, the BS sends confidential messages to a single communication user (CU), and at the same time wirelessly senses a point target and charges multiple energy receivers (ERs). It is assumed that the ERs and the sensing target are potential eavesdroppers that may attempt to intercept the confidential messages intended for the CU. We consider the joint transmit beamforming design to support secure communications while ensuring the sensing and powering requirements. In particular, the BS transmits dedicated sensing/energy beams in addition to the information beam, which also play the role of artificial noise (AN) for effectively jamming potential eavesdroppers. Building upon this, we maximize the secrecy rate at the CU, subject to the maximum \ac{crb} constraints for target sensing and the minimum harvested energy constraints for the ERs. Although the formulated joint beamforming problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, we acquire the optimal solution via the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and fractional programming techniques together with a one-dimensional (1D) search. Subsequently, we present two alternative designs based on zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and maximum ratio transmission (MRT), respectively. Finally, our numerical results show that our proposed approaches exploit both the distance-domain resolution of near-field ELAA and the joint beamforming design for enhancing secure communication performance while ensuring the sensing and powering requirements in ISCAP, especially when the CU and the target and ER eavesdroppers are located at the same angle (but different distances) with respect to the BS.</description>

      <title>Downlink Power Control based UE-Sided Initial Access for Tactical 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication technologies play a crucial role in battlefields. They are an inalienable part of any tactical response, whether at the battlefront or inland. Such scenarios require that the communication technologies be versatile, scalable, cost-effective, and stealthy. While multiple studies and past products have tried to address these requirements, none of them have been able to solve all the four challenges simultaneously. Hence, in this paper, we propose a tactical solution that is based on the versatile, scalable, and cost effective 5G NR system. Our focus is on the initial-access phase which is subject to a high probability of detection by an eavesdropper. To address this issue, we propose some modifications to how the UE performs initial access that lower the probability of detection while not affecting standards compliance and not requiring any modifications to the user equipment (UE) chipset implementation. Further, we demonstrate that with a simple downlink power control algorithm, we reduce the probability of detection at an eavesdropper. The result is a 5G NR based initial-access method that improves stealthiness when compared with a vanilla 5G NR implementation.</description>

      <title>ECG-TEM: Time-based sub-Nyquist sampling for ECG signal reconstruction and Hardware Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable heart rate monitoring (HRM) systems based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) have become increasingly crucial for preventing lifestyle diseases. For such portable systems, minimizing power consumption and sampling rate is critical due to the substantial data generated during long-term ECG monitoring. The variable pulse-width finite rate of innovation (VPW-FRI) framework provides an effective solution for low-rate sampling and compression of ECG signals. We develop a time-based sub-Nyquist sampling and reconstruction method for ECG signals specifically designed for HRM applications. Our approach harnesses the integrate-and-fire time-encoding machine (IF-TEM) as a power-efficient, time-based, asynchronous sampler, generating a sequence of time instants without the need for a global clock. The ECG signal is represented as a linear combination of VPW-FRI pulses, which is then subjected to pre-filtering before being sampled by the IF-TEM sampler. A compactly supported robust filter with a frequency-domain alias cancellation condition is used to combat the effects of noise. Our reconstruction process involves consecutive partial summations of discrete representations of the input signal derived from the series of time encodings, further enhancing the accuracy of the reconstructed ECG signals. Additionally, we introduce an IF-TEM sampling hardware system for ECG signals, implemented using an analog filter device. The firing rate is 42-80Hz, equivalent to approximately 0.025-0.05 of the Nyquist rate. Our hardware validation bridges the gap between theory and practice and demonstrates the robust performance and practical applicability of our approach in accurately monitoring heart rates and reconstructing ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gait Abnormalities in Foot-Floor Contacts During Walking Through FootstepInduced Structural Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gait abnormality detection is critical for the early discovery and progressive tracking of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's and Cerebral Palsy. Especially, analyzing the foot-floor contacts during walking provides important insights into gait patterns, such as contact area, contact force, and contact time, enabling gait abnormality detection through these measurements. Existing studies use various sensing devices to capture such information, including cameras, wearables, and force plates. However, the former two lack force-related information, making it difficult to identify the causes of gait health issues, while the latter has limited coverage of the walking path. In this study, we leverage footstep-induced structural vibrations to infer foot-floor contact profiles and detect gait abnormalities. The main challenge lies in modeling the complex force transfer mechanism between the foot and the floor surfaces, leading to difficulty in reconstructing the force and contact profile during foot-floor interaction using structural vibrations. To overcome the challenge, we first characterize the floor vibration for each contact type (e.g., heel, midfoot, and toe contact) to understand how contact forces and areas affect the induced floor vibration. Then, we leverage the time-frequency response spectrum resulting from those contacts to develop features that are representative of each contact type. Finally, gait abnormalities are detected by comparing the predicted foot-floor contact force and motion with the healthy gait. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a real-world walking experiment with 8 subjects. Our approach achieves 91.6% and 96.7% accuracy in predicting contact type and time, respectively, leading to 91.9% accuracy in detecting various types of gait abnormalities, including asymmetry, dragging, and midfoot/toe contacts.</description>

      <title>Single Input Multi Output Model of Molecular Communication via Diffusion with Spheroidal Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spheroids are aggregates of cells that can mimic the cellular organization often found in tissues. They are typically formed through the self-assembly of cells in a culture where there is a promotion of interactions and cell-to-cell communication. Spheroids can be created from various cell types, including cancer cells, stem cells, and primary cells, and they serve as valuable tools in biological research. In this letter, molecule propagation from a point source is simulated in the presence of multiple spheroids to observe the impact of the spheroids on the spatial molecule distribution. The spheroids are modeled as porous media with a corresponding effective diffusion coefficient. System variations are considered with a higher spheroid porosity (i.e., with a higher effective diffusion coefficient) and with molecule uptake by the spheroid cells (approximated as a first-order degradation reaction while molecules diffuse within the spheroid). Results provide initial insights about the molecule propagation dynamics and their potential to model transport and drug delivery within crowded spheroid systems.</description>

      <title>Computation-efficient Virtual Sensing Approach with Multichannel Adjoint Least Mean Square Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multichannel active noise control (ANC) systems are designed to create a large zone of quietness (ZoQ) around the error microphones, however, the placement of these microphones often presents challenges due to physical limitations. Virtual sensing technique that effectively suppresses the noise far from the physical error microphones is one of the most promising solutions. Nevertheless, the conventional multichannel virtual sensing ANC (MVANC) system based on the multichannel filtered reference least mean square (MCFxLMS) algorithm often suffers from high computational complexity. This paper proposes a feedforward MVANC system that incorporates the multichannel adjoint least mean square (MCALMS) algorithm to overcome these limitations effectively. Computational analysis demonstrates the improvement of computational efficiency and numerical simulations exhibit comparable noise reduction performance at virtual locations compared to the conventional MCFxLMS algorithm. Additionally, the effects of varied tuning noises on system performance are also investigated, providing insightful findings on optimizing MVANC systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Signal Separation for Automotive Radar Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms for joint mutual interference mitigation and object parameter estimation are a key enabler for automotive applications of frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. The underlying signal model poses a challenge for signal separation, since both the coherent radar echo and the non-coherent interference influenced by individual multipath propagation channels must be considered. In particular, under certain assumptions, the model is described as a superposition of multipath channels weighted by parametric chirp envelopes in the case of interference. In this paper, we introduce a method inspired by sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to detect and estimate radar object parameters while also estimating and successively canceling the interference signal. An augmented probabilistic model is employed that uses hierarchical Gamma-Gaussian prior model for each multipath channel separately. Based on this model an iterative inference algorithm is derived using the variational expectation-maximization (EM) methodology. The algorithm is statistically evaluated in terms of object parameter estimation accuracy and robustness, indicating that it is fundamentally capable of achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with respect to the accuracy of object estimates and it closely follows the radar performance achieved when no interference is present.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Dynamic ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks: A Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL) Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is essential for enabling the vehicular networks. However, the communication channel in this scenario exhibits time-varying characteristics, and the potential targets may move rapidly, creating a doubly-dynamic phenomenon. This nature poses a challenge for real-time precoder design. While optimization-based solutions are widely researched, they are complex and heavily rely on perfect prior information, which is impractical in double dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose using constrained deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) to facilitate dynamic updates to the ISAC precoder design. Additionally, the primal dual-deep deterministic policy gradient (PD-DDPG) and Wolpertinger architecture are tailored to efficiently train the algorithm under complex constraints and variable numbers of users. The proposed scheme not only adapts to the dynamics based on observations but also leverages environmental information to enhance performance and reduce complexity. Its superiority over existing candidates has been validated through experiments.</description>

      <title>SolNet: Open-source deep learning models for photovoltaic power forecasting across the globe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have gained increasing prominence in recent years in the field of solar pho-tovoltaic (PV) forecasting. One drawback of these models is that they require a lot of high-quality data to perform well. This is often infeasible in practice, due to poor measurement infrastructure in legacy systems and the rapid build-up of new solar systems across the world. This paper proposes SolNet: a novel, general-purpose, multivariate solar power forecaster, which addresses these challenges by using a two-step forecasting pipeline which incorporates transfer learning from abundant synthetic data generated from PVGIS, before fine-tuning on observational data. Using actual production data from hundreds of sites in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium, we show that SolNet improves forecasting performance over data-scarce settings as well as baseline models. We find transfer learning benefits to be the strongest when only limited observational data is available. At the same time we provide several guidelines and considerations for transfer learning practitioners, as our results show that weather data, seasonal patterns, amount of synthetic data and possible mis-specification in source location, can have a major impact on the results. The SolNet models created in this way are applicable for any land-based solar photovoltaic system across the planet where simulated and observed data can be combined to obtain improved forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Load Estimation in a Two-Priority mMTC Random Access Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of cellular networks for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) is an appealing solution due to the wide availability of cellular infrastructure. Estimating the number of devices (network load) is vital for efficient allocation of the available resources, especially for managing the random access channel (RACH) of the network. This paper considers a two-priority RACH and proposes two network load estimators: a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator and a reduced complexity (RCML) variant. The estimators are based on a novel model of the random access behavior of the devices coupled with a flexible analytical framework to calculate the involved probabilities. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed estimators for different network configurations.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Intermittent CSI Estimation with Adaptive Intervals in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the distinct objectives and multipath utilization mechanisms between the communication module and radar module, the system design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) necessitates two types of channel state information (CSI), i.e., communication CSI representing the whole channel gain and phase shifts, and radar CSI exclusively focused on target mobility and position information. However, current ISAC systems apply an identical mechanism to estimate both types of CSI at the same predetermined estimation interval, leading to significant overhead and compromised performances. Therefore, this paper proposes an intermittent communication and radar CSI estimation scheme with adaptive intervals for individual users/targets, where both types of CSI can be predicted using channel temporal correlations for cost reduction or re-estimated via training signal transmission for improved estimation accuracy. Specifically, we jointly optimize the binary CSI re-estimation/prediction decisions and transmit beamforming matrices for individual users/targets to maximize communication transmission rates and minimize radar tracking errors and costs in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) ISAC system. Unfortunately, this problem has causality issues because it requires comparing system performances under re-estimated CSI and predicted CSI during the optimization. Additionally, the binary decision makes the joint design a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, resulting in high complexity when using conventional optimization algorithms. Therefore, we propose a deep reinforcement online learning (DROL) framework that first implements an online deep neural network (DNN) to learn the binary CSI updating decisions from the experiences. Given the learned decisions, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the remaining beamforming design problem efficiently.</description>

      <title>Iterative Detection and Decoding Schemes with LLR Refinements in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose low-complexity local detectors and log-likelihood ratio (LLR) refinement techniques for a coded cell-free massive multiple input multiple output (CF- mMIMO) systems, where an iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme is applied using parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and access point (AP) selection. In particular, we propose three LLR processing schemes based on the individual processing of the LLRs of each AP, LLR censoring, and a linear combination of LLRs by assuming statistical independence. We derive new closed-form expressions for the local soft minimum mean square error (MMSE)-PIC detector and receive matched filter (RMF). We also examine the system performance as the number of iterations increases. Simulations assess the performance of the proposed techniques against existing approaches.</description>

      <title>High Performance P300 Spellers Using GPT2 Word Prediction With Cross-Subject Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severely impairs patients' ability to communicate, often leading to a decline in their quality of life within a few years of diagnosis. The P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication method by interpreting a subject's EEG response to characters presented on a grid interface.
  This paper addresses the common speed limitations encountered in training efficient P300-based multi-subject classifiers by introducing innovative "across-subject" classifiers. We leverage a combination of the second-generation Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize stimuli and suggest word completion choices based on typing history. Additionally, we employ a multi-layered smoothing technique to accommodate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
  Through extensive simulations involving random sampling of EEG data from subjects, we demonstrate significant speed enhancements in typing passages containing rare and OOV words. These optimizations result in approximately 10% improvement in character-level typing speed and up to 40% improvement in multi-word prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting standard row/column highlighting techniques with layered word prediction yields close-to-optimal performance.
  Furthermore, we explore both "within-subject" and "across-subject" training techniques, showing that speed improvements are consistent across both approaches.</description>

      <title>Clipped Uniform Quantizers for Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to employ clipped uniform quantization in federated learning settings, aiming to enhance model efficiency by reducing communication overhead without compromising accuracy. By employing optimal clipping thresholds and adaptive quantization schemes, our method significantly curtails the bit requirements for model weight transmissions between clients and the server. We explore the implications of symmetric clipping and uniform quantization on model performance, highlighting the utility of stochastic quantization to mitigate quantization artifacts and improve model robustness. Through extensive simulations on the MNIST dataset, our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near full-precision performance while ensuring substantial communication savings. Specifically, our approach facilitates efficient weight averaging based on quantization errors, effectively balancing the trade-off between communication efficiency and model accuracy. The comparative analysis with conventional quantization methods further confirms the superiority of our technique.</description>

      <title>Boosted Neural Decoders: Achieving Extreme Reliability of LDPC Codes for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring extremely high reliability is essential for channel coding in 6G networks. The next-generation of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) scenario within 6G networks requires a frame error rate (FER) below 10-9. However, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, the standard in 5G new radio (NR), encounter a challenge known as the error floor phenomenon, which hinders to achieve such low rates. To tackle this problem, we introduce an innovative solution: boosted neural min-sum (NMS) decoder. This decoder operates identically to conventional NMS decoders, but is trained by novel training methods including: i) boosting learning with uncorrected vectors, ii) block-wise training schedule to address the vanishing gradient issue, iii) dynamic weight sharing to minimize the number of trainable weights, iv) transfer learning to reduce the required sample count, and v) data augmentation to expedite the sampling process. Leveraging these training strategies, the boosted NMS decoder achieves the state-of-the art performance in reducing the error floor as well as superior waterfall performance. Remarkably, we fulfill the 6G xURLLC requirement for 5G LDPC codes without the severe error floor. Additionally, the boosted NMS decoder, once its weights are trained, can perform decoding without additional modules, making it highly practical for immediate application.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) aims to communicate with a single-antenna user in the downlink and sense the unknown and random angle parameter of a target via exploiting its prior distribution information. We consider a general transmit beamforming structure where the BS sends one communication beam and potentially one or multiple dedicated sensing beam(s). Firstly, motivated by the periodic feature of the angle parameter, we derive the periodic posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) for quantifying a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE), which is more accurate than the conventional PCRB for bounding the mean-squared error (MSE). Then, note that more sensing beams enable higher flexibility in enhancing the sensing performance, while also generating extra interference to the communication user. To resolve this trade-off, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the periodic PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement for the user. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we derive the optimal solution by leveraging the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique and Lagrange duality theory. Moreover, we analytically prove that at most one dedicated sensing beam is needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and the advantage of having a dedicated sensing beam.</description>

      <title>DCT-Based Decorrelated Attention for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based attention initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.</description>

Abstract: The average multicast rate (AMR) is analyzed in a multicast channel utilizing analog beamforming with finite-alphabet inputs, considering statistical channel state information (CSI). New expressions for the AMR are derived for non-cooperative and cooperative multicasting scenarios. Asymptotic analyses are conducted in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime to derive the array gain and diversity order. It is proved that the analog beamformer influences the AMR through its array gain, leading to the proposal of efficient beamforming algorithms aimed at maximizing the array gain to enhance the AMR.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Resource Allocation for MIMO Bistatic Backscatter Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistatic backscatter communication promises ubiquitous, massive connectivity by utilizing passive tags to connect with a reader by reflecting carrier emitter (CE) signals for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. This study focuses on the joint design of the transmit/received beamformers at the CE/reader and the reflection coefficient of the tag. A throughput maximization problem is thus formulated, subject to satisfying the tag requirements. We develop a joint design through a series of trial-and-error interactions within the environment, driven by a predefined reward system in a continuous state and action context. We propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to address the underlying optimization problem, namely deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can learn from the environment and incrementally enhance its behavior, achieving performance that is on par with two leading benchmarks. Further, we also compared the performance of the proposed method with deep Q-network (DQN), double deep Q-network (DDQN), and dueling DQN (DuelDQN). For a system with twelve antennas, SAC leads with a 26.76% gain over DQN, followed by alternative optimization (AO) and DDPG at 23.02% and 19.16%. DDQN and DuelDQN show smaller improvements of 10.40% and 14.36%, respectively, against DQN.</description>

      <title>Multi-instrument analysis of L-band amplitude scintillation observed over the Eastern Arabian Peninsula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of L1 amplitude scintillation-causing ionospheric irregularities over the Eastern Arabian Peninsula during the ascending phase of solar cycle 25 (years 2020--2023). The temporal occurrences of weak and strong scintillation were separated by sunset, with weak scintillation observed predominantly pre-sunset during the winter solstice and strong scintillation observed mainly post-sunset during the autumnal equinox. Strong scintillation was much more pronounced in 2023 compared to the other three years, indicating a strong influence of solar activity. Spatially, weak-scintillation-causing irregularities exhibited a wide distribution in azimuth and elevation, while strong-scintillation-causing irregularities were concentrated southwards. The combined analysis of S4 and rate of total electron content index (ROTI) suggested that small-scale ionospheric irregularities were present in both pre- and post-sunset periods, while large-scale irregularities were only seen during the post-sunset period. Furthermore, the presence of southward traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) during the 2023 autumnal equinox was confirmed with the total electron content anomaly ($\Delta\text{TEC}$), while the Ionospheric Bubble Index (IBI) provided by the Swarm mission was unable to confirm the presence of equatorial plasma bubbles during the same period. Observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 mission indicated that strong-scintillation-causing irregularities were more prevalent under the F2-layer peak, while the weak-scintillation-causing irregularities were mostly observed at the E-layer, F2-layer, and above the F2-layer.</description>

      <title>SpGesture: Source-Free Domain-adaptive sEMG-based Gesture Recognition with Jaccard Attentive Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) based gesture recognition offers a natural and intuitive interaction modality for wearable devices. Despite significant advancements in sEMG-based gesture-recognition models, existing methods often suffer from high computational latency and increased energy consumption. Additionally, the inherent instability of sEMG signals, combined with their sensitivity to distribution shifts in real-world settings, compromises model robustness.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel SpGesture framework based on Spiking Neural Networks, which possesses several unique merits compared with existing methods: (1) Robustness: By utilizing membrane potential as a memory list, we pioneer the introduction of Source-Free Domain Adaptation into SNN for the first time. This enables SpGesture to mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by distribution shifts. (2) High Accuracy: With a novel Spiking Jaccard Attention, SpGesture enhances the SNNs' ability to represent sEMG features, leading to a notable rise in system accuracy. To validate SpGesture's performance, we collected a new sEMG gesture dataset which has different forearm postures, where SpGesture achieved the highest accuracy among the baselines ($89.26\%$). Moreover, the actual deployment on the CPU demonstrated a system latency below 100ms, well within real-time requirements. This impressive performance showcases SpGesture's potential to enhance the applicability of sEMG in real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpGesture.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Computation for 6G: Foundations, Technologies, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies has given rise to diversified intelligent services, which place unprecedented demands on massive connectivity and gigantic data aggregation. However, the scarce radio resources and stringent latency requirement make it challenging to meet these demands. To tackle these challenges, over-the-air computation (AirComp) emerges as a potential technology. Specifically, AirComp seamlessly integrates the communication and computation procedures through the superposition property of multiple-access channels, which yields a revolutionary multiple-access paradigm shift from "compute-after-communicate" to "compute-when-communicate". By this means, AirComp enables spectral-efficient and low-latency wireless data aggregation by allowing multiple devices to occupy the same channel for transmission. In this paper, we aim to present the recent advancement of AirComp in terms of foundations, technologies, and applications. The mathematical form and communication design are introduced as the foundations of AirComp, and the critical issues of AirComp over different network architectures are then discussed along with the review of existing literature. The technologies employed for the analysis and optimization on AirComp are reviewed from the information theory and signal processing perspectives. Moreover, we present the existing studies that tackle the practical implementation issues in AirComp systems, and elaborate the applications of AirComp in Internet of Things and edge intelligent networks. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to motivate the future development of AirComp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To model existing or future low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks leveraging multiple constellations, we propose a simple analytical approach to represent the clustering of satellites on orbits. More precisely, we develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process that effectively captures the geometric fact that satellites are always positioned on orbits, and these orbits may vary in altitude. Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading. The derived statistics enable the evaluation of the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters.</description>

      <title>Greedy Selection for Heterogeneous Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous operation of all sensors in a large-scale sensor network is power-consuming and computationally expensive. Hence, it is desirable to select fewer sensors. A greedy algorithm is widely used for sensor selection in homogeneous networks with a theoretical worst-case performance of (1-1/e) ~ 63% of the optimal performance when optimizing submodular metrics. For heterogeneous sensor networks (HSNs) comprising multiple sets of sensors, most of the existing sensor selection methods optimize the performance constrained by a budget on the total value of the selected sensors. However, in many applications, the number of sensors to select from each set is known apriori, and solutions are not well-explored. For this problem, we propose a joint greedy heterogeneous sensor selection algorithm. Theoretically, we show that the worst-case performance of the proposed algorithm is bounded to 50% of the optimum for submodular cost metrics. In the special case of HSNs with two sensor networks, the performance guarantee can be improved to 63% when the number of sensors to select from one set is much smaller than the other. To validate our results experimentally, we propose a submodular metric based on the frame potential measure that considers both the correlation among the sensor measurements and their heterogeneity. We prove theoretical bounds for the mean squared error of the solution when this performance metric is used. We validate our results through simulation experiments considering both linear and non-linear measurement models corrupted by additive noise and quantization errors. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm results in 4-10 dB lower error than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Channel State Information-Free Location-Privacy Enhancement: Fake Path Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a channel state information (CSI)-free, fake path injection (FPI) scheme is proposed for location-privacy preservation. By leveraging the geometrical feasibility of the fake paths, under mild conditions, it can be proved that the illegitimate device cannot distinguish between a fake and true path, thus degrading the illegitimate devices' ability to localize. Two closed-form, lower bounds on the illegitimate devices' estimation error are derived via the analysis of the Fisher information of the location-relevant channel parameters, thus characterizing the enhanced location privacy. A transmit precoder is proposed, which efficiently injects the virtual fake paths. The intended device receives the two parameters of the precoder design over a secure channel in order to enable localization. The impact of leaking the precoder structure and the associated localization leakage are analyzed. Theoretical analyses are verified via simulation. Numerical results show that a 20dB degradation of the illegitimate devices' localization accuracy can be achieved and validate the efficacy of the proposed FPI versus using unstructured Gaussian noise or a CSI-dependent beamforming strategy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze how the use of companding techniques, together with digital predistortion (DPD), can be leveraged to improve system efficiency and performance in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems based on power splitting. By taking advantage of the benefits of each of these well-known techniques to mitigate non-linear effects due to power amplifier (PA) and energy harvesting (EH) operation, we illustrate how DPD and companding can be effectively combined to improve the EH efficiency while keeping unalterable the information transfer performance. We establish design criteria that allow the PA to operate in a higher efficiency region so that the reduction in peak-to-average power ratio over the transmitted signal is translated into an increase in the average radiated power and EH efficiency. The performance of DPD and companding techniques is evaluated in a number of scenarios, showing that a combination of both techniques allows to significantly increase the power transfer efficiency in SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Evaluation of Euclidean Alignment with Deep Learning for EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for various Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have shown promising results, they are hindered by the substantial data requirements. By leveraging data from multiple subjects, transfer learning enables more effective training of DL models. A technique that is gaining popularity is Euclidean Alignment (EA) due to its ease of use, low computational complexity, and compatibility with Deep Learning models. However, few studies evaluate its impact on the training performance of shared and individual DL models. In this work, we systematically evaluate the effect of EA combined with DL for decoding BCI signals. We used EA to train shared models with data from multiple subjects and evaluated its transferability to new subjects. Our experimental results show that it improves decoding in the target subject by 4.33% and decreases convergence time by more than 70%. We also trained individual models for each subject to use as a majority-voting ensemble classifier. In this scenario, using EA improved the 3-model ensemble accuracy by 3.7%. However, when compared to the shared model with EA, the ensemble accuracy was 3.62% lower.</description>

      <title>Optimising O-to-U Band Transmission Using Fast ISRS Gaussian Noise Numerical Integral Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the transmission of ultrawideband signals, including wavelength-dependent fibre parameters: dispersion, nonlinear coefficient and effective fibre core area. To that end, the inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering Gaussian noise integral model is extended to include these parameters. The integrals involved in this frequency-domain model are numerically solved in hyperbolic coordinates using a Riemann sum. The model implementation is designed to work on parallel GPUs and is optimised for fast computational time. The model is valid for Gaussian-distributed signals and is compared with the split-step Fourier method, for transmission over standard single-mode fibre (SSMF) in the O-band (wavelengths around the zero-dispersion wavelength), showing reasonable agreement. Further, we demonstrated SNR evaluation over an 80~km SSFM single-span transmission using 589x96 GBaud channels, corresponding to almost 59 THz optical bandwidth, fully populating the O, E, S, C, L and U bands (1260-1675 nm). The SNR evaluation is completed in just 3.6 seconds using four Nvidia V100 16GB PCIe GPUs. Finally, we used this model to find the optimum launch power profile for this system achieving 747 Tbps of potential throughput over 80 km fibre and demonstrating its suitability for UWB optimisation routines.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Innovation in 6G Research: Real-Time Capable SDR System Architecture for Rapid Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming 3GPP global mobile communication standard 6G strives to push the technological limits of radio frequency (RF) communication even further than its predecessors: Sum data rates beyond 100 Gbit/s, RF bandwidths above 1 GHz per link, and sub-millisecond latency necessitate very high performance development tools. We propose a new SDR firmware and software architecture designed explicitly to meet these challenging requirements. It relies on Ethernet and commercial off-the-shelf network and server components to maximize flexibility and to reduce costs. We analyze state-of-the-art solutions (USRP X440 and other RFSoC-based systems), derive architectural design goals, explain resulting design decision in detail, and exemplify our architecture's implementation on the XCZU48DR RFSoC. Finally, we validate its performance via measurements and outline how the architecture surpasses the state-of-the-art with respect to sustained RF recording, while maintaining high Ethernet bandwidth efficiency. Building a micro-Doppler radar example, we demonstrate its real-time and rapid application development capabilities.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Real-time Cine and Flow under In-magnet Staged Exercise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a wellestablished imaging tool for diagnosing and managing cardiac conditions. The integration of exercise stress with CMR (ExCMR) can enhance its diagnostic capacity. Despite recent advances in CMR technology, quantitative ExCMR during exercise remains technically challenging due to motion artifacts and limited spatial and temporal resolution. Methods: This study investigated the feasibility of biventricular functional and hemodynamic assessment using real-time (RT) ExCMR during a staged exercise protocol in 24 healthy volunteers. We applied a coil reweighting technique and employed high acceleration rates to minimize motion blurring and artifacts. We further applied a beat-selection technique that identified beats from the endexpiratory phase to minimize the impact of respiration-induced through-plane motion. Additionally, results from six patients were presented to demonstrate clinical feasibility. Results: Our findings indicated a consistent decrease in end-systolic volume and stable end-diastolic volume across exercise intensities, leading to increased stroke volume and ejection fraction. The selection of end-expiratory beats enhanced the repeatability of cardiac function parameters, as shown by scan-rescan tests in nine volunteers. High scores from a blinded image quality assessment indicated that coil reweighting effectively minimized motion artifacts. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of RT ExCMR with inmagnet exercise in healthy subjects and patients. Our results indicate that high acceleration rates, coil reweighting, and selection of respiratory phase-specific heartbeats enhance image quality and repeatability of quantitative RT ExCMR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have expanded the current status of semantic communication limited to processing one task to a more general system that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. In pursuit of this, we first introduced our definition of the "semantic source", enabling the interpretation of multiple semantics based on a single observation. A semantic encoder design is then introduced, featuring the division of the encoder into a common unit and multiple specific units enabling cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic source and the system design. Our approach employs information maximization (infomax) and end-to-end design principles.</description>

      <title>Human Skin Permittivity Characterization for Mobile Handset Evaluation at Sub-THz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript proposes a method for characterizing the complex permittivity of the human finger skin based on an open-ended waveguide covered with a thin dielectric sheet at sub-terahertz frequencies. The measurement system is initially analyzed through full-wave simulations with a detailed finger model. Next, the model is simplified by replacing the finger with an infinite sheet of human skin to calculate the forward electromagnetic problem related to the permittivity characterization. Following this, a radial basis network is employed to train the inverse problem solver. Finally, the complex permittivities of finger skins are characterized for 10 volunteers. The variations in complex relative permittivity across different individuals and skin regions are analyzed, revealing a deviation of $&lt;\pm 1.5$ for both the dielectric constants and loss factors across 140 to 220 GHz. Repeated measurements at the same location on the finger demonstrate good repeatability with a relative estimation uncertainty $&lt;\pm 1.5\%$.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an extremely large-scale massive multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system. As the scale of antenna arrays increases, the range of near-field communications also expands. In this case, the signals no longer exhibit planar wave characteristics but spherical wave characteristics in the near-field channel, which makes the channel state information (CSI) highly complex. Additionally, the increase of the antenna arrays scale also makes the size of the CSI matrix significantly increase. Therefore, CSI feedback in the near-field channel becomes highly challenging. To solve this issue, we propose a deep-learning (DL)-based ExtendNLNet that can compress the CSI, and further reduce the overhead of CSI feedback. In addition, we have introduced the Non-Local block to obtain a larger area of CSI features. Simulation results show that the proposed ExtendNLNet can significantly improve the CSI recovery quality compared to other DL-based methods.</description>

      <title>K-band: Self-supervised MRI Reconstruction via Stochastic Gradient Descent over K-space Subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Label Propagation Techniques for Artifact Detection in Imbalanced Classes using Photoplethysmogram Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the application of label propagation techniques to propagate labels among photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, particularly in imbalanced class scenarios and limited data availability scenarios, where clean PPG samples are significantly outnumbered by artifact-contaminated samples. We investigated a dataset comprising PPG recordings from 1571 patients, wherein approximately 82% of the samples were identified as clean, while the remaining 18% were contaminated by artifacts. Our research compares the performance of supervised classifiers, such as conventional classifiers and neural networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)), with the semi-supervised Label Propagation (LP) algorithm for artifact classification in PPG signals. The results indicate that the LP algorithm achieves a precision of 91%, a recall of 90%, and an F1 score of 90% for the "artifacts" class, showcasing its effectiveness in annotating a medical dataset, even in cases where clean samples are rare. Although the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) supervised model demonstrated good results with a precision of 89%, a recall of 95%, and an F1 score of 92%, the semi-supervised algorithm excels in artifact detection. In the case of imbalanced and limited pediatric intensive care environment data, the semi-supervised LP algorithm is promising for artifact detection in PPG signals. The results of this study are important for improving the accuracy of PPG-based health monitoring, particularly in situations in which motion artifacts pose challenges to data interpretation</description>

Abstract: An introduction of intelligent interconnectivity for people and things has posed higher demands and more challenges for sixth-generation (6G) networks, such as high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, ultra-low latency, and ultra-high reliability. Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), also called intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), are two promising technologies for coping with these unprecedented demands. Given their distinct capabilities, integrating the two technologies to further enhance wireless network performances has received great research and development attention. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of research on RIS-aided CF mMIMO wireless communication systems. We first introduce system models focusing on system architecture and application scenarios, channel models, and communication protocols. Subsequently, we summarize the relevant studies on system operation and resource allocation, providing in-depth analyses and discussions. Following this, we present practical challenges faced by RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, particularly those introduced by RIS, such as hardware impairments and electromagnetic interference. We summarize corresponding analyses and solutions to further facilitate the implementation of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems. Furthermore, we explore an interplay between RIS-aided CF mMIMO and other emerging 6G technologies, such as next-generation multiple-access (NGMA), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), and millimeter wave (mmWave). Finally, we outline several research directions for future RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02818v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its momentum-based variants are widely used for optimization, but they typically suffer from slow convergence. Conversely, existing adaptive learning rate optimizers speed up convergence but often compromise generalization. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel optimization method designed to accelerate SGD's convergence without sacrificing generalization. Our approach reduces the variance of the historical gradient, improves first-order moment estimation of SGD by applying Wiener filter theory, and introduces a time-varying adaptive gain. Empirical results demonstrate that SGDF (SGD with Filter) effectively balances convergence and generalization compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Hypergraph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modeling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing block in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of the hypergraph structural information from the model training stage. The proposed model, simplified hypergraph neural network (SHNN), contains a training-free message-passing block that can be precomputed before the training of SHNN, thereby reducing the computational burden. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of SHNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on six real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction present that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, SHNN shows both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on Cora-CA, SHNN achieves the highest node classification accuracy with just 2% training time of the best baseline.</description>
