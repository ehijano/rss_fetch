      <title>A flow-kick model of dryland vegetation patterns: the impact of rainfall variability on resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many drylands around the globe, vegetation self-organizes into regular spatial patterns in response to aridity stress. We consider the regularly-spaced vegetation bands, on gentle hill-slopes, that survive low rainfall conditions by harvesting additional stormwater from upslope low-infiltration bare zones. We are interested in the robustness of this pattern formation survival mechanism to changes in rainfall variability. For this, we use a flow-kick modeling framework that treats storms as instantaneous kicks to the soil water. The positive feedbacks in the storm-level hydrology, that act to concentrate water within the vegetation bands, are captured through the spatial profiles of the soil water kicks. Between storms, the soil water and vegetation, modeled by a two-component reaction-diffusion system, evolve together. We use a combination of linear stability analysis and numerical simulation to compare predictions of idealized periodic rainfall, with no variability, to predictions when there is randomness in the timing and magnitude of water input from storms. We show that including these random elements leads to a decrease in the parameter range over which patterns appear. This suggests that an increase in storm variability, even with the same mean annual rainfall, may negatively impact the resilience of these pattern-forming dryland ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Implementing photonic-crystal resonator frequency combs in a photonics foundry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an AIM Photonics silicon-nitride platform to fabricate photonic-crystal resonators for generating optical parametric oscillators (OPO) and soliton microcombs. Our approach leverages the scalability and fine feature size of silicon-nitride processing on large-scale silicon wafers to achieve low-loss, high-Q microresonators, functionalized by nano-scale photonic-crystal structures. We demonstrate intrinsic microresonator quality factor up to 1.2*10^7 with complete foundry fabrication on 300 mm silicon, a 700 nm thick silicon-nitride device layer, and inclusion of complex nanophotonics. These features enable a host of nonlinear nanophotonics sources on the platform, including OPOs, microcombs, parametric amplifiers, squeezed-light generators, and single-photon sources. By fine-tuning the photonic-crystal design parameters, we achieve broad tunability in the frequency of the OPO output, spanning a significant portion of the near-infrared. Additionally, we observe the formation of soliton frequency combs, enabled by the precise dispersion engineering of the microresonators. These results highlight the potential of widely accessible, photolithographically patterned, silicon-nitride photonics to enable wide access to and complex integration of frequency-comb sources, with applications in spectroscopy, metrology, and communications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin modes and fixed-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>
