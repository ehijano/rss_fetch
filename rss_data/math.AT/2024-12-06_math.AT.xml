      <title>Dynamical Persistent Homology via Wasserstein Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce novel methodologies designed to adapt original data in response to the dynamics of persistence diagrams along Wasserstein gradient flows. Our research focuses on the development of algorithms that translate variations in persistence diagrams back into the data space. This advancement enables direct manipulation of the data, guided by observed changes in persistence diagrams, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and interpretation in the context of topological data analysis.</description>

      <title>Mass partitions by parallel hyperplanes via Fadell-Husseini index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a problem of mass partitions by parallel hyperplanes. Takahashi and Sober\'on conjectured an extension of the classical ham sandwich theorem: any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be simultaneously equipartitioned by $k$ parallel hyperplanes. We construct a configuration space -- test map scheme and prove a new Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem to show that the conjecture is true in the case when the Stirling number of second kind $S(d+k-1, k)$ is odd. This recovers exactly the parity condition obtained by Hubard and Sober\'on via different methods, reinforcing the possibility that this condition is both necessary and sufficient. Our proof relies on a novel computation of the Fadell-Husseini index.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral products associated to pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homotopy theory of polyhedral products associated to a combinatorial generalisation of manifolds known as pseudomanifolds. As special cases, we show that loop spaces of moment-angle manifolds associated to triangulations of $S^2$ and $S^3$ decompose as a product of spheres and loops on spheres.</description>

      <title>Estimating the persistent homology of $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued functions using function-geometric multifiltrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an unknown $\mathbb{R}^n$-valued function $f$ on a metric space $X$, can we approximate the persistent homology of $f$ from a finite sampling of $X$ with known pairwise distances and function values? This question has been answered in the case $n=1$, assuming $f$ is Lipschitz continuous and $X$ is a sufficiently regular geodesic metric space, and using filtered geometric complexes with fixed scale parameter for the approximation. In this paper we answer the question for arbitrary $n$, under similar assumptions and using function-geometric multifiltrations. Our analysis offers a different view on these multifiltrations by focusing on their approximation properties rather than on their stability properties. We also leverage the multiparameter setting to provide insight into the influence of the scale parameter, whose choice is central to this type of approach.</description>

      <title>Bordism and resolution of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We adapt algorithms for resolving the singularities of complex algebraic varieties to prove that the natural map of homology theories from complex bordism to the bordism theory of complex derived orbifolds splits. In equivariant stable homotopy theory, our techniques yield a splitting of homology theories for the map from bordism to the equivariant bordism theory of a finite group $\Gamma$, given by assigning to a manifold its product with $\Gamma$. In symplectic topology, and using recent work of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirshi-Swaminathan, we conclude that one can define complex cobordism-valued Gromov-Witten invariant for arbirary (closed) symplectic manifolds. We apply our results to constrain the topology of the space of Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$. The methods we develop apply to normally complex orbifolds, and will hence lead to applications in symplectic topology that rely on moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Alpha shapes and optimal transport on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [3], the authors used the Legendre transform to give a tractable method for studying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in terms of sums of Gaussian kernels. In this paper, we prove a variant for sums of cosine similarity-based kernel functions, which requires considering the more general "$c$-transform" from optimal transport theory [16]. We then apply these methods to a point cloud arising from a recent breakthrough study, which exhibits a toroidal structure in the brain activity of rats [11]. A key part of this application is that the transport map and transformed density function arising from the theorem replace certain delicate preprocessing steps related to density-based denoising and subsampling.</description>

      <title>Motivic Euler Characteristic of Nearby Cycles and a Generalized Quadratic Conductor Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the motivic Euler characteristic of Ayoub's nearby cycles spectrum in terms of strata of a semi-stable reduction, for a degeneration to multiple semi-quasi-homogeneous singularities. This allows us to compare the local picture at the singularities with the global conductor formula for hypersurfaces developed by Levine, Pepin Lehalleur and Srinivas, revealing that the formula is local in nature, thus extending it to the more general setting considered in this paper. The result is a quadratic refinement to the Milnor number formula with multiple singularities.</description>

      <title>Making the motivic group structure on the endomorphisms of the projective line explicit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a group structure on the set of pointed naive homotopy classes of scheme morphisms from the Jouanolou device to the projective line. The group operation is defined via matrix multiplication on generating sections of line bundles and only requires basic algebraic geometry. In particular, it is completely independent of the construction of the motivic homotopy category. We show that a particular scheme morphism, which exhibits the Jouanolou device as an affine torsor bundle over the projective line, induces a monoid morphism from Cazanave's monoid to this group. Moreover, we show that this monoid morphism is a group completion to a subgroup of the group of scheme morphisms from the Jouanolou device to the projective line. This subgroup is generated by a set of morphisms that are simple to describe.</description>
