      <title>Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration from QCD Confinement Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a phenomenological extension of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model by introducing a coupling between the Polyakov loop potential and the Hubble parameter $H(t)$, inspired by the hypothesis that the QCD vacuum, particularly in the confined phase, may be sensitive to the large-scale dynamics of the universe. The coupling term, proportional to $(H(t)/H_0)^d f(\Phi)$, vanishes in the deconfined regime and acts as a dynamical dark energy contribution at late times, without invoking a fundamental cosmological constant. This framework maintains the thermodynamic consistency of the PNJL model and introduces a minimal modification to the effective potential, controlled by a single exponent $d$. We confront the model with low-redshift cosmological data, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, HII galaxies, and quasars. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis, we derive constraints on the model parameters and compare its performance with LambdaCDM. Our results show that the modified PNJL cosmology provides a statistically competitive fit to current data within 68% C.L.; while offering a theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios. We discuss the implications for QCD in curved spacetime and suggest avenues for further theoretical and observational investigation.</description>

      <title>Information Wells and the Emergence of Primordial Black Holes in a Cyclic Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) remain one of the most intriguing candidates for dark matter and a unique probe of physics at extreme curvatures. Here, we examine their formation in a bounce cosmology when the post-crunch universe inherits a highly inhomogeneous distribution of imprint entropy from the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM). Within QMM, every Planck-scale cell stores quantum information about infalling matter; the surviving entropy field S(x) contributes an effective dust component T^QMM_{\mu\nu} = lambda * [ (nabla_mu S)(nabla_nu S) - (1/2) * g_{\mu\nu} * (nabla S)^2 + ... ] that deepens curvature wherever S is large. We show that (i) reasonable bounce temperatures and a QMM coupling lambda ~ O(1) naturally amplify these "information wells" until the density contrast exceeds the critical value delta_c ~ 0.3; (ii) the resulting PBH mass spectrum spans 10^{-16} to 10^3 solar masses, matching current microlensing and PTA windows; and (iii) the same mechanism links PBH abundance to earlier QMM explanations of dark matter and the cosmic matter-antimatter imbalance. Observable signatures include a mild blue tilt in small-scale power, characteristic mu-distortions, and an enhanced integrated Sachs-Wolfe signal - all of which will be tested by upcoming CMB, PTA, and lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>On exterior-algebraic quaternions with application to Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of exterior algebra, the concept of time-like quaternions has been previously established. This paper advances beyond the existing structure by elucidating the procedure for constructing time-like quaternions with the feature of complex scalar terms. We delineate on the crucial role of these extended definition of quaternions in formulating Maxwell equations, having properly defined a pure quaternion containing the components of the classical electric and magnetic fields. Through a formal introduction, we describe the approach followed to acquiring time-like quaternions, characterized by having complex scalar term, and their significant relationship with the derivation of Maxwell equations. This topic not only underscores the mathematical intricacies of quaternionic algebra, but also highlights its profound implications in the description of fundamental electromagnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Complex dispersion relation of Rayleigh-Bloch waves trapped by slow inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rayleigh-Bloch waves are guided acoustic waves propagating along a periodic line of inclusions placed inside an open, infinite medium. Below the sound cone, they are transversely evanescent on both sides of the line of inclusions. Guidance is then achieved without any cladding surrounding the segmented core. Inclusions usually impose definite boundary conditions, resulting in a single guided band. We consider instead the case of permeable, slow inclusions inside a fast medium. Introducing the concept of guided quasi-normal modes, we obtain the complex dispersion relation taking into account radiation at infinity. We thus show that multiple bands of leaky Rayleigh-Bloch waves appear and that guided bound states in the continuum arise as a result of the combination of symmetry and periodicity.</description>
