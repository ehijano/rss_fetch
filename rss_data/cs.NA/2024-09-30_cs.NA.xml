      <title>Quasi-Orthogonal Runge-Kutta Projection Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of physical phenomena exhibit auxiliary admissibility criteria, such as conservation of entropy or various energies, which arise implicitly under exact solution of their governing PDEs. However, standard temporal schemes, such as classical Runge-Kutta (RK) methods, do not enforce these constraints, leading to a loss of accuracy and stability. Projection is an efficient way to address this shortcoming by correcting the RK solution at the end of each time step. Here we introduce a novel projection method for explicit RK schemes, called a \textit{quasi-orthogonal} projection method. This method can be employed for systems containing a single (not necessarily convex) invariant functional, for dissipative systems, and for the systems containing multiple invariants. It works by projecting the orthogonal search direction(s) into the solution space spanned by the RK stage derivatives. With this approach linear invariants of the problem are preserved, the time step size remains fixed, additional computational cost is minimal, and these optimal search direction(s) preserve the order of accuracy of the base RK method. This presents significant advantages over existing projection methods. Numerical results demonstrate that these properties are observed in practice for a range of applications.</description>

      <title>Crank-Nicolson-type iterative decoupled algorithms for Biot's consolidation model using total pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop Crank-Nicolson-type iterative decoupled algorithms for a three-field formulation of Biot's consolidation model using total pressure. We begin by constructing an equivalent fully implicit coupled algorithm using the standard Crank-Nicolson method for the three-field formulation of Biot's model. Employing an iterative decoupled scheme to decompose the resulting coupled system, we derive two distinctive forms of Crank-Nicolson-type iterative decoupled algorithms based on the order of temporal computation and iteration: a time-stepping iterative decoupled algorithm and a global-in-time iterative decoupled algorithm. Notably, the proposed global-in-time algorithm supports a partially parallel-in-time feature. Capitalizing on the convergence properties of the iterative decoupled scheme, both algorithms exhibit second-order time accuracy and unconditional stability. Through numerical experiments, we validate theoretical predictions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of these novel approaches.</description>

      <title>An accelerated frequency-independent solver for oscillatory differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential equations arise in many scientific calculations. Because the running times of standard solvers increase linearly with frequency when they are applied to such problems, a variety of specialized methods, most of them quite complicated, have been proposed. Here, we point out that one of the simplest approaches not only works, but yields a scheme for solving oscillatory second order linear ordinary differential equations which is significantly faster than current state-of-the-art techniques. Our method, which operates by constructing a slowly varying phase function representing a basis of solutions of the differential equation, runs in time independent of the frequency and can be applied to second order equations whose solutions are oscillatory in some regions and slowly varying in others. In the high-frequency regime, our algorithm discretizes the nonlinear Riccati equation satisfied by the derivative of the phase function via a Chebyshev spectral collocation method and applies the Newton-Kantorovich method to the resulting system of nonlinear algebraic equations. We prove that the iterates converge quadratically to a nonoscillatory solution of the Riccati equation. The quadratic convergence of the Newton-Kantorovich method and the simple form of the linearized equations ensure that this procedure is extremely efficient. Our algorithm then extends the slowly varying phase function calculated in the high-frequency regime throughout the solution domain by solving a certain third order linear ordinary differential equation related to the Riccati equation. We describe the results of numerical experiments showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, including the modified Magnus method [18], the current state-of-the-art approach [7] and the recently introduced ARDC method [1].</description>

      <title>Numerical method for the zero dispersion limit of the fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully discrete Crank-Nicolson Fourier-spectral-Galerkin (FSG) scheme for approximating solutions of the fractional Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, which involves a fractional Laplacian with exponent $\alpha \in [1,2]$ and a small dispersion coefficient of order $\varepsilon^2$. The solution in the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$ is known as the zero dispersion limit. We demonstrate that the semi-discrete FSG scheme conserves the first three integral invariants, thereby structure preserving, and that the fully discrete FSG scheme is $L^2$-conservative, ensuring stability. Using a compactness argument, we constructively prove the convergence of the approximate solution to the unique solution of the fractional KdV equation in $C([0,T]; H_p^{1+\alpha}(\mathbb{R}))$ for the periodic initial data in $H_p^{1+\alpha}(\mathbb{R})$. The devised scheme achieves spectral accuracy for the initial data in $H_p^r,$ $r \geq 1+\alpha$ and exponential accuracy for the analytic initial data. Additionally, we establish that the approximation of the zero dispersion limit obtained from the fully discrete FSG scheme converges to the solution of the Hopf equation in $L^2$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, up to the gradient catastrophe time $t_c$. Beyond $t_c$, numerical investigations reveal that the approximation converges to the asymptotic solution, which is weakly described by the Whitham's averaged equation within the oscillatory zone for $\alpha = 2$. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the scheme and to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an Algebraic Flux Correction Scheme for a nonlinear Scalar Conservation Law Using SSP-RK2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar conservation law with linear and nonlinear flux function on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset{\R}^2$ with Lipschitz boundary $\partial\Omega.$ We discretize the spatial variable with the standard finite element method where we use a local extremum diminishing flux limiter which is linearity preserving. For temporal discretization, we use the second order explicit strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta method. It is known that the resulting fully-discrete scheme satisfies the discrete maximum principle. Under the sufficiently regularity of the weak solution and the CFL condition $k = \mathcal{O}(h^2)$, we derive error estimates in $L^{2}-$ norm for the algebraic flux correction scheme in space and in $\ell^\infty$ in time. We also present numerical experiments that validate that the fully-discrete scheme satisfies the temporal order of convergence of the fully-discrete scheme that we proved in the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving scheme for fractional nonlinear diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a numerical scheme for solving the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem associated with fractional nonlinear diffusion equations. These equations generalize the porous medium equation and the fast diffusion equation by incorporating a fractional diffusion term. We provide a rigorous analysis showing that the discretization preserves main properties of the continuous equations, including algebraic decay in the fractional porous medium case and the extinction phenomenon in the fractional fast diffusion case. The study is supported by extensive numerical simulations. In addition, we propose a novel method for accurately computing the extinction time for the fractional fast diffusion equation and illustrate numerically the convergence of rescaled solutions towards asymptotic profiles near the extinction time.</description>

      <title>$L_2$-approximation using randomized lattice algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a randomized lattice algorithm for approximating multivariate periodic functions over the $d$-dimensional unit cube from the weighted Korobov space with mixed smoothness $\alpha &gt; 1/2$ and product weights $\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\ldots\in [0,1]$. Building upon the deterministic lattice algorithm by Kuo, Sloan, and Wo\'{z}niakowski (2006), we incorporate a randomized quadrature rule by Dick, Goda, and Suzuki (2022) to accelerate the convergence rate. This randomization involves drawing the number of points for function evaluations randomly, and selecting a good generating vector for rank-1 lattice points using the randomized component-by-component algorithm. We prove that our randomized algorithm achieves a worst-case root mean squared $L_2$-approximation error of order $M^{-\alpha/2 - 1/8 + \varepsilon}$ for an arbitrarily small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $M$ denotes the maximum number of function evaluations, and that the error bound is independent of the dimension $d$ if the weights satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^\infty \gamma_j^{1/\alpha} &lt; \infty$. Our upper bound converges faster than a lower bound on the worst-case $L_2$-approximation error for deterministic rank-1 lattice-based approximation proved by Byrenheid, K\"{a}mmerer, Ullrich, and Volkmer (2017). We also show a lower error bound of order $M^{-\alpha/2-1/2}$ for our randomized algorithm, leaving a slight gap between the upper and lower bounds open for future research.</description>

      <title>asQ: parallel-in-time finite element simulations using ParaDiag for geoscientific models and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern high performance computers are massively parallel; for many PDE applications spatial parallelism saturates long before the computer's capability is reached. Parallel-in-time methods enable further speedup beyond spatial saturation by solving multiple timesteps simultaneously to expose additional parallelism. ParaDiag is a particular approach to parallel-in-time based on preconditioning the simultaneous timestep system with a perturbation that allows block diagonalisation via a Fourier transform in time. In this article, we introduce asQ, a new library for implementing ParaDiag parallel-in-time methods, with a focus on applications in the geosciences, especially weather and climate. asQ is built on Firedrake, a library for the automated solution of finite element models, and the PETSc library of scalable linear and nonlinear solvers. This enables asQ to build ParaDiag solvers for general finite element models and provide a range of solution strategies, making testing a wide array of problems straightforward. We use a quasi-Newton formulation that encompasses a range of ParaDiag methods, and expose building blocks for constructing more complex methods. The performance and flexibility of asQ is demonstrated on a hierarchy of linear and nonlinear atmospheric flow models. We show that ParaDiag can offer promising speedups and that asQ is a productive testbed for further developing these methods.</description>

      <title>On the convergence rate of a numerical method for the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a robust error estimate for a recently proposed numerical method for $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$. In particular, if the following two conditions hold: i) there exist a constant $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$, and ii), the singular continuous part of the initial energy measure is zero, then the numerical wave profile converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{\beta}{8}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$.
  Moreover, if $\alpha=0$, then the rate improves to $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{4}})$ without the above assumptions, and we also obtain a convergence rate for the associated energy measure - it converges with order $O(\Delta x^{\frac{1}{2}})$ in the bounded Lipschitz metric. These convergence rates are illustrated by several examples.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Least Squares, Orthogonal Projection, and QR Factorization Algorithms Subject to Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Liesen et al. (2002), which analyzes how the condition number of an orthonormal matrix Q changes when a column is added ([Q, c]), particularly focusing on the perpendicularity of c to the span of Q. Their result, presented in Theorem 2.3 of Liesen et al. (2002), assumes exact arithmetic and orthonormality of Q, which is a strong assumption when applying these results to numerical methods such as QR factorization algorithms. In our work, we address this gap by deriving bounds on the condition number increase for a matrix B without assuming perfect orthonormality, even when a column is not perfectly orthogonal to the span of B. This framework allows us to analyze QR factorization methods where orthogonalization is imperfect and subject to Gaussian noise. We also provide results on the performance of orthogonal projection and least squares under Gaussian noise, further supporting the development of this theory.</description>

      <title>A Robin-Robin splitting method for the Stokes-Biot fluid-poroelastic structure interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a splitting method for fluid-poroelastic structure interaction. The fluid is described using the Stokes equations and the poroelastic structure is described using the Biot equations. The transmission conditions on the interface are mass conservation, balance of stresses, and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition. The splitting method involves single and decoupled Stokes and Biot solves at each time step. The subdomain problems use Robin boundary conditions on the interface, which are obtained from the transmission conditions. The Robin data is represented by an auxiliary interface variable. We prove that the method is unconditionally stable and establish that the time discretization error is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T}\Delta t)$, where $T$ is the final time and $\Delta t$ is the time step. We further study the iterative version of the algorithm, which involves an iteration between the Stokes and Biot sub-problems at each time step. We prove that the iteration converges to a monolithic scheme with a Robin Lagrange multiplier used to impose the continuity of the velocity. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Galerkin Method of Regularized Stokeslets for Procedural Fluid Flow with Control Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new procedural incompressible velocity field authoring tool, which lets users design a volumetric flow by directly specifying velocity along control curves. Our method combines the Method of Regularized Stokeslets with Galerkin discretization. Based on the highly viscous Stokes flow assumption, we find the force along a given set of curves that satisfies the velocity constraints along them. We can then evaluate the velocity anywhere inside the surrounding infinite 2D or 3D domain. We also show the extension of our method to control the angular velocity along control curves. Compared to a collocation discretization, our method is not very sensitive to the vertex sampling rate along control curves and only requires a small linear system solve.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for fast and accurate Statistical Computation of Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generative AI algorithm for addressing the challenging task of fast, accurate and robust statistical computation of three-dimensional turbulent fluid flows. Our algorithm, termed as GenCFD, is based on a conditional score-based diffusion model. Through extensive numerical experimentation with both incompressible and compressible fluid flows, we demonstrate that GenCFD provides very accurate approximation of statistical quantities of interest such as mean, variance, point pdfs, higher-order moments, while also generating high quality realistic samples of turbulent fluid flows and ensuring excellent spectral resolution. In contrast, ensembles of operator learning baselines which are trained to minimize mean (absolute) square errors regress to the mean flow. We present rigorous theoretical results uncovering the surprising mechanisms through which diffusion models accurately generate fluid flows. These mechanisms are illustrated with solvable toy models that exhibit the relevant features of turbulent fluid flows while being amenable to explicit analytical formulas.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary discrete shock profiles for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For scalar conservation laws, we prove that spectrally stable stationary Lax discrete shock profiles are nonlinearly stable in some polynomially-weighted $\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$ spaces. In comparison with several previous nonlinear stability results on discrete shock profiles, we avoid the introduction of any weakness assumption on the amplitude of the shock and apply our analysis to a large family of schemes that introduce some artificial possibly high-order viscosity. The proof relies on a precise description of the Green's function of the linearization of the numerical scheme about spectrally stable discrete shock profiles obtained in [Coeu23]. The present article also pinpoints the ideas for a possible extension of this nonlinear orbital stability result for discrete shock profiles in the case of systems of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Additive Schwarz methods for fourth-order variational inequalities</title>

Abstract: Fourth-order variational inequalities are encountered in various scientific and engineering disciplines, including elliptic optimal control problems and plate obstacle problems. In this paper, we consider additive Schwarz methods for solving fourth-order variational inequalities. Based on a unified framework of various finite element methods for fourth-order variational inequalities, we develop one- and two-level additive Schwarz methods. We prove that the two-level method is scalable in the sense that the convergence rate of the method depends on $H/h$ and $H/\delta$ only, where $h$ and $H$ are the typical diameters of an element and a subdomain, respectively, and $\delta$ measures the overlap among the subdomains. This proof relies on a new nonlinear positivity-preserving coarse interpolation operator, the construction of which was previously unknown. To the best of our knowledge, this analysis represents the first investigation into the scalability of the two-level additive Schwarz method for fourth-order variational inequalities. Our theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Fully adaptive structure-preserving hyper-reduction of parametric Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model order reduction provides low-complexity high-fidelity surrogate models that allow rapid and accurate solutions of parametric differential equations. The development of reduced order models for parametric \emph{nonlinear} Hamiltonian systems is challenged by several factors: (i) the geometric structure encoding the physical properties of the dynamics; (ii) the slowly decaying Kolmogorov $n$-width of conservative dynamics; (iii) the gradient structure of the nonlinear flow velocity; (iv) high variations in the numerical rank of the state as a function of time and parameters. We propose to address these aspects via a structure-preserving adaptive approach that combines symplectic dynamical low-rank approximation with adaptive gradient-preserving hyper-reduction and parameters sampling. Additionally, we propose to vary in time the dimensions of both the reduced basis space and the hyper-reduction space by monitoring the quality of the reduced solution via an error indicator related to the projection error of the Hamiltonian vector field. The resulting adaptive hyper-reduced models preserve the geometric structure of the Hamiltonian flow, do not rely on prior information on the dynamics, and can be solved at a cost that is linear in the dimension of the full order model and linear in the number of test parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performances of the fully adaptive models compared to the original and reduced models.</description>

      <title>Error Distribution for One-Dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation Driven By Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We can define the error distribution as the limiting distribution of the error between the solution $Y$ of a given stochastic differential equation (SDE) and its numerical approximation $\hat{Y}^{(m)}$, weighted by the convergence rate between the two. A goal when studying the error distribution is to provide a way of determination for error distributions for any SDE and numerical scheme that converge to the exact solution. By dividing the error into a main term and a remainder term in a particular way, the author shows that the remainder term can be negligible compared to the main term under certain suitable conditions. Under these conditions, deriving the error distribution reduces to deriving the limiting distribution of the main term. Even if the dimension is one, there are unsolved problems about the asymptotic behavior of the error when the SDE has a drift term and $0&lt;H\leq 1/3$, but our result in the one-dimensional case can be adapted to any Hurst exponent. The main idea of the proof is to define a stochastic process $Y^{m, \rho}$ with the parameter $\rho$ interpolating between $Y$ and $\hat{Y}^{(m)}$ and to estimate the asymptotic expansion for it. Using this estimate, we determine the error distribution of the ($k$)-Milstein scheme and of the Crank-Nicholson scheme in unsolved cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new Krylov subspace recycling method for solving a linear system of equations, or a sequence of slowly changing linear systems. Our approach is to reduce the computational overhead of recycling techniques while still benefiting from the acceleration afforded by such techniques. As such, this method augments an unprojected Krylov subspace. Furthermore, it combines randomized sketching and deflated restarting in a way that avoids orthogononalizing a full Krylov basis. We call this new method GMRES-SDR (sketched deflated restarting). With this new method, we provide new theory, which initially characterizes unaugmented sketched GMRES as a projection method for which the projectors involve the sketching operator. We demonstrate that sketched GMRES and its sibling method sketched FOM are an MR/OR pairing, just like GMRES and FOM. We furthermore obtain residual convergence estimates. Building on this, we characterize GMRES-SDR also in terms of sketching-based projectors. Compression of the augmented Krylov subspace for recycling is performed using a sketched version of harmonic Ritz vectors. We present results of numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of GMRES-SDR over competitor methods such as GMRES-DR and GCRO-DR.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of A Data-Driven Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonlinear Ill-Posed Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a promising method for solving large-scale inverse problems, due to its excellent scalability with respect to data size. In this work, we analyze a new data-driven regularized stochastic gradient descent for the efficient numerical solution of a class of nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. At each step of the iteration, the method randomly selects one equation from the nonlinear system combined with a corresponding equation from the learned system based on training data to obtain a stochastic estimate of the gradient and then performs a descent step with the estimated gradient. We prove the regularizing property of this method under the tangential cone condition and a priori parameter choice and then derive the convergence rates under the additional source condition and range invariance conditions. Several numerical experiments are provided to complement the analysis.</description>

      <title>Projection method for quasiperiodic elliptic equations and application to quasiperiodic homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06841v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multi-level block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the spectral accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a randomized extension of the deep splitting algorithm introduced in [Beck, Becker, Cheridito, Jentzen, and Neufeld (2021)] using random neural networks suitable to approximately solve both high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic PDEs and PIDEs with jumps having (possibly) infinite activity. We provide a full error analysis of our so-called random deep splitting method. In particular, we prove that our random deep splitting method converges to the (unique viscosity) solution of the nonlinear PDE or PIDE under consideration. Moreover, we empirically analyze our random deep splitting method by considering several numerical examples including both nonlinear PDEs and nonlinear PIDEs relevant in the context of pricing of financial derivatives under default risk. In particular, we empirically demonstrate in all examples that our random deep splitting method can approximately solve nonlinear PDEs and PIDEs in 10'000 dimensions within seconds.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to design a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the Benjamin-Ono equation. We analyze the stability and error estimates for the semi-discrete LDG scheme. We prove that the scheme is $L^2$-stable and it converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1/2})$ for general nonlinear flux. Furthermore, we develop a fully discrete LDG scheme using the four-stage fourth order Runge-Kutta method and ensure the devised scheme is strongly stable in case of linear flux using two-step and three-step stability approach under an appropriate time step constraint. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Splinets -- splines through the Taylor expansion, their support sets and orthogonal bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new representation of splines that targets efficiency in the analysis of functional data is implemented. The efficiency is achieved through two novel features: using the recently introduced orthonormal spline bases, the so-called {\it splinets} and accounting for the spline support sets in the proposed spline object representation. The recently-introduced orthogonal splinets are evaluated by {\it dyadic orthogonalization} of the $B$-splines. The package is built around the {\it Splinets}-object that represents a collection of splines. It treats splines as mathematical functions and contains information about the support sets and the values of the derivatives at the knots that uniquely define these functions. Algebra and calculus of splines utilize the Taylor expansions at the knots within the support sets. Several orthonormalization procedures of the $B$-splines are implemented including the recommended dyadic method leading to the splinets. The method bases on a dyadic algorithm that can be also viewed as the efficient method of diagonalizing a band matrix. The locality of the $B$-splines in terms of the support sets is, to a great extend, preserved in the corresponding splinet. This together with implemented algorithms utilizing locality of the supports provides a valuable computational tool for functional data analysis. The benefits are particularly evident when the sparsity in the data plays an important role. Various diagnostic tools are provided allowing to maintain the stability of the computations. Finally, the projection operation to the space of splines is implemented that facilitates functional data analysis. An example of a simple functional analysis of the data using the tools in the package is presented. The functionality of the package extends beyond the splines to piecewise polynomial functions, although the splines are its focus.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of Nonlocal Dirichlet Energies With Penalty Formulations of Dirichlet Boundary Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal Dirichlet energies associated with a class of nonlocal diffusion models on a bounded domain subject to the conventional local Dirichlet boundary condition. The goal of this paper is to give a general framework to correctly impose Dirichlet boundary condition in nonlocal diffusion model. To achieve this, we formulate the Dirichlet boundary condition as a penalty term and use theory of $\varGamma$-convergence to study the correct form of the penalty term. Based on the analysis of $\varGamma$-convergence, we prove that the Dirichlet boundary condition can be correctly imposed in nonlocal diffusion model in the sense of $\varGamma$-convergence as long as the penalty term satisfies a few mild conditions. This work provides a theoretical foundation for approximate Dirichlet boundary condition in nonlocal diffusion model.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Process Framework for Solving Forward and Inverse Problems Involving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). PIML models are increasingly built via deep neural networks (NNs) whose architecture and training process are designed such that the network satisfies the PDE system. While such PIML models have substantially advanced over the past few years, their performance is still very sensitive to the NN's architecture and loss function. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce kernel-weighted Corrective Residuals (CoRes) to integrate the strengths of kernel methods and deep NNs for solving nonlinear PDE systems. To achieve this integration, we design a modular and robust framework which consistently outperforms competing methods in solving a broad range of benchmark problems. This performance improvement has a theoretical justification and is particularly attractive since we simplify the training process while negligibly increasing the inference costs. Additionally, our studies on solving multiple PDEs indicate that kernel-weighted CoRes considerably decrease the sensitivity of NNs to factors such as random initialization, architecture type, and choice of optimizer. We believe our findings have the potential to spark a renewed interest in leveraging kernel methods for solving PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flow Based Phase-Field Modeling Using Separable Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^2$ gradient flow of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional leads to the Allen Cahn equation that is widely used for modeling phase separation. Machine learning methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation in its strong form suffer from inaccuracies in collocation techniques, errors in computing higher-order spatial derivatives through automatic differentiation, and the large system size required by the space-time approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose a separable neural network-based approximation of the phase field in a minimizing movement scheme to solve the aforementioned gradient flow problem. At each time step, the separable neural network is used to approximate the phase field in space through a low-rank tensor decomposition thereby accelerating the derivative calculations. The minimizing movement scheme naturally allows for the use of Gauss quadrature technique to compute the functional. A `$tanh$' transformation is applied on the neural network-predicted phase field to strictly bounds the solutions within the values of the two phases. For this transformation, a theoretical guarantee for energy stability of the minimizing movement scheme is established. Our results suggest that bounding the solution through this transformation is the key to effectively model sharp interfaces through separable neural network. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning methods for phase separation problems and is an order of magnitude faster than the finite element method.</description>
