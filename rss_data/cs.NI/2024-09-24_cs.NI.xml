      <title>Increasing Information-Carrying Capacity by Exploiting Diverse Traffic Characteristics in Multi-Band Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient network management in optical backbone networks is crucial for handling continuous traffic growth. In this work, we address the challenges of managing dynamic traffic in C- and C+L-band optical backbone networks while exploring application flexibility, namely the compressibility and delayability metrics. We propose a strategy, named Delay-Aware and Compression-Aware (DACA) provisioning algorithm, which reduces blocking probability, thereby increasing information-carrying capacity of the network compared to baseline strategies.</description>

      <title>VERCEL: Verification and Rectification of Configuration Errors with Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Vercel, a network verification and automatic fault rectification tool that is based on a computationally tractable, algorithmically expressive, and mathematically aesthetic domain of linear algebra. Vercel works on abstracting out packet headers into standard basis vectors that are used to create a port-specific forwarding matrix $\mathcal{A}$, representing a set of packet headers/prefixes that a router forwards along a port. By equating this matrix $\mathcal{A}$ and a vector $b$ (that represents the set of all headers under consideration), we are able to apply \textit{least squares} (which produces a column rank agnostic solution) to compute which headers are reachable at the destination. Reachability now simply means evaluating if vector $b$ is in the column space of $\mathcal{A}$, which can efficiently be computed using least squares. Further, the use of vector representation and least squares opens new possibilities for understanding network behavior. For example, we are able to map rules, routing policies, what-if scenarios to the fundamental linear algebraic form, $\mathcal{A}x=b$, as well as determine how to configure forwarding tables appropriately. We show Vercel is faster than the state-of-art such as NetPlumber, Veriflow, APKeep, AP Verifier, when measured over diverse datasets. Vercel is almost as fast as Deltanet, when rules are verified in batches and provides better scalability, expressiveness and memory efficiency. A key highlight of Vercel is that while evaluating for reachability, the tool can incorporate intents, and transform these into auto-configurable table entries, implying a recommendation/correction system.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Communications for Interplanetary and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated pace of space exploration and satellite connectivity calls for scalable communication network architectures that can effectively cater for increasing numbers of bursty flows, such as those occurring in remote monitoring and actuation. Communications in Space face unique challenges including highly variable delays and disruptions that sometimes preclude real-time signaling and end-to-end acknowledgements. In this paper we provide a vision for tackling these fundamental challenges by exploiting recent progress in goal-oriented communication. Our vision for Goal-Oriented Networking in Space is built on three pillars: (1) principles and decision metrics for goal-oriented sampling and multi-user scheduling, that can handle highly variable delay processes that contain memory, (2) grant-free access policies for massive machine-type communications that replace exogenous arrivals with goal-oriented traffic shaping, and (3) flow control mechanisms that exploit the cross-layer operability at application and link layers of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols.</description>

      <title>Hyper-parameter Optimization for Wireless Network Traffic Prediction Models with A Novel Meta-Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based hyper-parameter optimization framework for wireless network traffic prediction models. An attention-based deep neural network (ADNN) is adopted as the prediction model, i.e., base-learner, for each wireless network traffic prediction task, namely base-task, and a meta-learner is employed to automatically generate the optimal hyper-parameters for a given base-learner according to the corresponding base-task's intrinsic characteristics or properties, i.e., meta-features. Based on our observation from real-world traffic records that base-tasks possessing similar meta-features tend to favour similar hyper-parameters for their base-learners, the meta-learner exploits a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) learning method to obtain a set of candidate hyper-parameter selection strategies for a new base-learner, which are then utilized by an advanced genetic algorithm with intelligent chromosome screening to finally acquire the best hyper-parameter selection strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that base-learners in the proposed framework have high potential prediction ability for wireless network traffic prediction task, and the meta-learner can enormously elevate the base-learners' performance by providing them the optimal hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Nonroutine Network Traffic Prediction with a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper pioneers a nonroutine network traffic prediction (NNTP) method to prospectively provide a theoretical basis for avoiding large-scale network disruption by accurately predicting bursty traffic. Certain events that impact user behavior subsequently trigger nonroutine traffic, which significantly constrains the performance of network traffic prediction (NTP) models. By analyzing nonroutine traffic and the corresponding events, the NNTP method is pioneered to construct interpretable NTP model. Based on the real-world traffic data, the network traffic generated during soccer games serves as a case study to validate the performance of the NNTP method. The numerical results indicate that our prediction closely fits the traffic pattern. In comparison to existing researches, the NNTP method is at the forefront of finding a balance among interpretability, accuracy, and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Architectural Challenges of Nomadic Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines architectural challenges and opportunities arising from Nomadic Networks in the context of emerging 6G research. Nomadic networks are proposed as a solution to the limitations of stationary communication networks, providing enhanced connectivity for dynamic and mobile environments, such as large outdoor events, emergency situations and mobile industrial applications. The key requirements for nomadic networks are outlined, including functional split within the Radio Access Network and robust backhauling solutions. It also addresses the complexity of managing network components, ensuring interoperability with existing systems and maintaining stakeholder trust. A comprehensive architectural framework for Nomadic Networks in 6G is proposed. Different deployment scenarios for Nomadic Networks are investigated, including spawned, steered, and wandering Radio Access Networks as well as integrated, migrated and donated Core Networks. By introducing Nomadic-Network-as-a-Service and a related orchestration framework, the potential for flexible and scalable network management is emphasized. By addressing the architectural challenges, the paper provides a path for the successful implementation of Nomadic Networks towards more adaptable and flexible 6G networks that can meet the evolving needs of multiple sectors.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Routing Algorithm over SDN: Reusable Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic routing is vital for the proper functioning of the Internet. As users and network traffic increase, researchers try to develop adaptive and intelligent routing algorithms that can fulfill various QoS requirements. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based routing algorithms have shown better performance than traditional approaches. We developed a QoS-aware, reusable RL routing algorithm, RLSR-Routing over SDN. During the learning process, our algorithm ensures loop-free path exploration. While finding the path for one traffic demand (a source destination pair with certain amount of traffic), RLSR-Routing learns the overall network QoS status, which can be used to speed up algorithm convergence when finding the path for other traffic demands. By adapting Segment Routing, our algorithm can achieve flow-based, source packet routing, and reduce communications required between SDN controller and network plane. Our algorithm shows better performance in terms of load balancing than the traditional approaches. It also has faster convergence than the non-reusable RL approach when finding paths for multiple traffic demands.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating Google's Topics API into the digital advertising ecosystem represents a significant shift toward privacy-conscious advertising practices. This article analyses the implications of implementing Topics API on ad networks, focusing on competition dynamics and ad space accessibility. Through simulations based on extensive datasets capturing user behavior and market share data for ad networks, we evaluate metrics such as Ad Placement Eligibility, Low Competition Rate, and solo competitor. The findings reveal a noticeable impact on ad networks, with larger players strengthening their dominance and smaller networks facing challenges securing ad spaces and competing effectively. Moreover, the study explores the potential environmental implications of Google's actions, highlighting the need to carefully consider policy and regulatory measures to ensure fair competition and privacy protection. Overall, this research contributes valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of digital advertising and highlights the importance of balancing privacy with competition and innovation in the online advertising landscape.</description>

      <title>Cluster-based Network Time Synchronization for Resilience with Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time synchronization of devices in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks is one of the challenging problems and a pre-requisite for the design of low-latency applications. Although many existing solutions have tried to address this problem, almost all solutions assume all the devices (nodes) in the network are faultless. Furthermore, these solutions exchange a large number of messages to achieve synchronization, leading to significant communication and energy overhead. To address these shortcomings, we propose C-sync, a clustering-based decentralized time synchronization protocol that provides resilience against several types of faults with energy-efficient communication. C-sync achieves scalability by introducing multiple reference nodes in the network that restrict the maximum number of hops any node can have to its time source. The protocol is designed with a modular structure on the Contiki platform to allow application transitions. We evaluate C-sync on a real testbed that comprises over 40 Tmote Sky hardware nodes distributed across different levels in a building and show through experiments the fault resilience, energy efficiency, and scalability of the protocol. C-sync detects and isolates faults to a cluster and recovers quickly. The evaluation makes a qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art protocols and a quantitative comparison with a class of decentralized protocols (derived from GTSP) that provide synchronization with no/limited fault-tolerance. Results also show a reduction of 56.12% and 75.75% in power consumption in the worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively, compared to GTSP, while achieving similar accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Blockchain and IPFS Solution for Secure and Efficient Source Code Repository Hosting using Middleman Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Version control systems (VCS) are essential for software development, yet centralized VCS present risks such as data loss, security breaches, and ownership disputes. While blockchain-based approaches to decentralized source code repository hosting have been explored, many existing solutions struggle with challenges related to security, scalability, efficiency, and real-time collaboration. This study seeks to enhance these efforts by proposing a novel decentralized solution that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for secure, efficient, and resilient code repository hosting and governance. Our approach introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain with the efficiency of IPFS for off-chain storage. To facilitate real-time collaboration, we integrate a temporary centralized Middleman IPFS that manages transaction processing and enhances operational efficiency without compromising long-term security. This Middleman IPFS acts as an intermediary, balancing the speed of centralized systems with the resilience of decentralized architectures. Our system uses smart contracts to maintain access control and key management by dynamically verifying access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt data stored on IPFS. This integration allows for secure, real-time collaboration in environments where multiple collaborators need concurrent access to shared resources. Our system employs a hybrid encryption scheme that combines symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. The encrypted keys are stored on the blockchain, while IPFS handles the efficient storage of the codebase itself, with a Middleman IPFS maintaining concurrent collaboration, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing large-scale, collaborative coding projects.</description>

      <title>Improved Routing of Multiparty Entanglement over Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective routing of entanglements over a quantum network is a fundamental problem in quantum communication. Due to the fragility of quantum states, it is difficult to route entanglements at long distances. Graph states can be utilized for this purpose, reducing the need for long-distance entanglement routing by leveraging local operations. In this paper, we propose two graph state-based routing protocols for sharing GHZ states, achieving larger sizes than the existing works, for given network topologies. For this improvement, we consider tree structures connecting the users participating in the final GHZ states, as opposed to the linear configurations used in the earlier ones. For arbitrary network topologies, we show that if such a tree is balanced, it achieves a larger size than unbalanced trees. In particular, for grid networks, we show special constructions of the above-mentioned tree that achieve optimal results. Moreover, if the user nodes among whom the entanglement is to be routed are pre-specified, we propose a strategy to accomplish the required routing.</description>

      <title>Semantic Inference-Based Deep Learning and Modeling for Earth Observation: Cognitive Semantic Augmentation Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) systems play a crucial role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals by collecting and analyzing vital global data through satellite networks. These systems are essential for tasks like mapping, disaster monitoring, and resource management, but they face challenges in processing and transmitting large volumes of EO data, especially in specialized fields such as agriculture and real-time disaster response. Domain-adapted Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising solution by facilitating data fusion between extensive EO data and semantic EO data. By improving integration and interpretation of diverse datasets, LLMs address the challenges of processing specialized information in agriculture and disaster response applications. This fusion enhances the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data. This paper presents a framework for semantic communication in EO satellite networks, aimed at improving data transmission efficiency and overall system performance through cognitive processing techniques. The proposed system employs Discrete-Task-Oriented Source-Channel Coding (DT-JSCC) and Semantic Data Augmentation (SA) to focus on relevant information while minimizing communication overhead. By integrating cognitive semantic processing and inter-satellite links, the framework enhances the analysis and transmission of multispectral satellite imagery, improving object detection, pattern recognition, and real-time decision-making. The introduction of Cognitive Semantic Augmentation (CSA) allows satellites to process and transmit semantic information, boosting adaptability to changing environments and application needs. This end-to-end architecture is tailored for next-generation satellite networks, such as those supporting 6G, and demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.</description>

Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for quantum entanglement distribution over an optical network. We characterize and model a network architecture that employs a single quasideterministic time-frequency heralded EPR-pair source, and develop a routing scheme for distributing entangled photon pairs over such a network. We focus on fairness in entanglement distribution, and compare both the performance of various spectrum allocation schemes as well as their Jain index.</description>

Abstract: As modern DNN models grow ever larger, collective communications between the accelerators (allreduce, etc.) emerge as a significant performance bottleneck. Designing efficient communication schedules is challenging, given today's highly diverse and heterogeneous network fabrics. In this paper, we present ForestColl, a tool that generates performant schedules for any network topology. ForestColl constructs broadcast/aggregation spanning trees as the communication schedule, achieving theoretically optimal throughput. Its schedule generation runs in strongly polynomial time and is highly scalable. ForestColl supports any network fabric, including both switching fabrics and direct connections. We evaluated ForestColl on multi-box AMD MI250 and NVIDIA DGX A100 platforms. ForestColl's schedules delivered up to 130% higher performance compared to the vendors' own optimized communication libraries, RCCL and NCCL, and achieved a 20% speedup in LLM training. ForestColl also outperforms other state-of-the-art schedule generation techniques with both up to 61% more efficient generated schedules and orders of magnitude faster schedule generation speed.</description>

      <title>Resilience-by-Design in 6G Networks: Literature Review and Novel Enabling Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17480</link>

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) mobile communication networks are expected to intelligently integrate into various aspects of modern digital society, including smart cities, homes, health-care, transportation, and factories. While offering a multitude of services, it is likely that societies become increasingly reliant on 6G infrastructure. Any disruption to these digital services, whether due to human or technical failures, natural disasters, or terrorism, would significantly impact citizens' daily lives. Hence, 6G networks need not only to provide high-performance services but also to be resilient in maintaining essential services in the face of potentially unknown challenges. This paper provides a general review of the state of the art on resilient systems, definitions, concepts, and approaches. Moreover, it introduces a comprehensive concept, i.e., resilience-by-design (RBD), in three different levels for designing resilient 6G communication networks, summarizing our initial studies within the German Open6GHub project. First, we outline the general RBD enabling principles and discuss their related sub-categories. Next, adopting an interdisciplinary approach, we propose to embed these principles across all 6G layers/perspectives including electronics, physical channel, network components and functions, networks, services, and cross-layer and cross-infrastructure considerations and discuss their challenges. We further elaborate the RBD principles and their realizations along with several 6G use-cases. The paper is concluded by presenting a comprehensive list of open problems for future research on 6G resilience.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compression of Massive MIMO Channel State Information with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the use of deep autoencoders to compress the channel information in a \review{massive} multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system. Although autoencoders perform lossy compression, they still have adequate usefulness when applied to massive MIMO system channel state information (CSI) compression. To demonstrate their impact on the CSI, we measure the performance of the system under two different channel models for different compression ratios. We disclose a few practical considerations in using autoencoders for this propose. We show through simulation that the run-time complexity of this deep autoencoder is irrelative to the compression ratio and thus an adaptive compression rate is feasible with an optimal compression ratio depending on the channel model and the signal to noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Context-Conditioned Spatio-Temporal Predictive Learning for Reliable V2V Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving reliable multidimensional Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) channel state information (CSI) prediction is both challenging and crucial for optimizing downstream tasks that depend on instantaneous CSI. This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</description>
