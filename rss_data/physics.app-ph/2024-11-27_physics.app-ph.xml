      <title>Excitation Frequency Dependence of Noise and Minimum Detectable Force in AM-AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) is a powerful tool for observing nanoscale surface structures with minimal disruption. As we discussed previously, AM-AFM maximizes detection sensitivity when exciting the cantilever at the resonance slope rather than the resonance frequency. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how AM noise depends on the excitation frequency or what the optimal excitation frequency is for the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, no theoretical studies have investigated the noise bandwidth in the closed-loop system of AFM. Here, we formulate a quantitative theory of the minimum detectable force that accounts for the excitation frequency dependence. Our findings indicate that the AM noise dependence on excitation frequency can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator model when the oscillation amplitude exceeds the noise level. Under Brownian noise-limited conditions, the minimum detectable force decreases as the excitation frequency is lowered, approaching the dynamic-mode AFM limit.</description>

      <title>Superparamagnetic Superparticles for Magnetic Hyperthermia Therapy: Overcoming the Particle Size Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron oxide (e.g., Fe$_3$O$_4$ or Fe$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles are promising candidates for a variety of biomedical applications ranging from magnetic hyperthermia therapy to drug delivery and bio-detection, due to their superparamagnetism, non-toxicity, and biodegradability. While particles of small size (below a critical size, ~20 nm) display superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature, these particles tend to penetrate highly sensitive areas of the body such as the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), leading to undesired effects. In addition, these particles possess a high probability of retention, which can lead to genotoxicity and biochemical toxicity. Increasing particle size is a means for addressing these problems but also suppresses the superparamagnetism. We have overcome this particle size limit by synthesizing unique polycrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles composed of multiple nanocrystals of 10 to 15 nm size while tuning particle size from 160 to 400 nm. These so-called superparticles preserve superparamagnetic characteristics and exhibit excellent hyperthermia responses. The specific absorption rates (SAR) exceed 250 W/g (HAC = 800 Oe, f = 310 kHz) at a low concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, indicating their capability in cancer treatment with minimum dose. Our study underscores the potential of size-tunable polycrystalline iron oxide superparticles with superparamagnetic properties for advanced biomedical applications and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Improved Leakage Currents and Polarity Control through Oxygen Incorporation in Ferroelectric Al0.73Sc0.27N Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines systematic oxygen (O)-incorporation to reduce total leakage currents in sputtered wurtzite-type ferroelectric Al0.73Sc0.27N thin films, along with its impact on the material structure and the polarity of the as-grown films. The O in the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N was introduced through an external gas source during the reactive sputter process. In comparison to samples without doping, O-doped films showed almost a fourfold reduction of the leakage current near the coercive field. In addition, doping resulted in the reduction of the steady-state leakage currents by roughly one order of magnitude sub-coercive fields. Microstructure analysis using X-ray diffraction 1and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) revealed no significant structural degradation of the bulk Al0.73Sc0.27N. In case of the maximum O-doped film, the c-axis out-of-plane texture increased by only 20% from 1.8{\deg} and chemical mapping revealed a uniform distribution of oxygen incorporation into the bulk. Our results further demonstrate the ability to control the as-deposited polarity of Al0.73Sc0.27N via the O-concentration, changing from nitrogen- to metal-polar orientation. Thus, this article presents a promising approach to mitigate the leakage current in wurtzite-type Al0.73Sc0.27N without incurring any significant structural degradation of the bulk thin film quality, thereby making ferroelectric nitrides more suitable for microelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A Method for Fabricating CMOS Back-End-of-Line-Compatible Solid-State Nanopore Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state nanopores, nm-sized holes in thin, freestanding membranes, are powerful single-molecule sensors capable of interrogating a wide range of target analytes, from small molecules to large polymers. Interestingly, due to their high spatial resolution, nanopores can also identify tags on long polymers, making them an attractive option as the reading element for molecular information storage strategies. To fully leverage the compact and robust nature of solid-state nanopores, however, they will need to be packaged in a highly parallelized manner with on-chip electronic signal processing capabilities to rapidly and accurately handle the data generated. Additionally, the membrane itself must have specific physical, chemical, and electrical properties to ensure sufficient signal-to-noise ratios are achieved, with the traditional membrane material being SiNX . Unfortunately, the typical method of deposition, low-pressure vapour deposition, requires temperatures beyond the thermal budget of CMOS back-end-of-line integration processes, limiting the potential to generate an on-chip solution. To this end, we explore various lower-temperature deposition techniques that are BEOL-compatible to generate SiNx membranes for solid-state nanopore use, and successfully demonstrate the ability for these alternative methods to generate low-noise nanopores that are capable of performing single-molecule experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of magnetic spin Hall angle by extrinsic surface roughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic spin Hall effect arises from a reactive counterpart of the dissipative spin response that is responsible for the ordinary spin Hall effect. This interpretation is supported by the dependence of spin Hall effect signals on the reversal of magnetic order parameters and can be explained in terms of the symmetries of well-defined linear response functions. This proposal has enabled the generation and manipulation of spin currents electrically. In terms of conversion efficiency, the spin Hall angle is a key parameter used to characterize a material's ability to convert spin currents to charge currents and vice versa. Consequently, there is an ongoing effort to identify mechanisms that can increase the spin Hall angle. In theis work, it is proposed a mechanism based on extrinsic surface roughness, which enhances the magnetic spin Hall angle when the ratio of roughness to thickness is high. This mechanism represents an important discovery that will advance the development of charge-to-spin devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-sensitivity wireless pressure sensor with active processing structure designed on the dielectric substrate has been present and evaluated in this paper. The sensor configuration has been optimized by computer-aided design to achieve highest sensitivity and maximum working range for a given dimension. With the average sensitivity of 187kHz/kPa, the proposed pressure sensor is equipped with the ability to measure pressure loaded up to 1.5MPa under room temperature. Additionally, a novel simulation method applied on pressure related design is proposed in this article, with the accuracy reaching threefold enhancement, filling the blank of electromagnetic simulation of pressure deformation. Other characteristics of the devices have been investigated and are presented.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Quantum Anomaly Detection on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether in fundamental physics, cybersecurity or finance, the detection of anomalies with machine learning techniques is a highly relevant and active field of research, as it potentially accelerates the discovery of novel physics or criminal activities. We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization properties of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm, using projected quantum kernels for a realistic dataset of the latter application. These results were both theoretically simulated and experimentally validated on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, by leveraging partial state tomography to obtain precise approximations of the quantum states that are used to estimate the quantum kernels. Moreover, we analyzed both platforms respective hardware-efficient feature maps over a wide range of anomaly ratios and showed that for our financial dataset in all anomaly regimes, the quantum-enhanced OCSVMs lead to better generalization properties compared to the purely classical approach. As such our work bridges the gap between theory and practice in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and paves the path towards useful quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Mono-drive single-sideband modulation via optical delay lines on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical single-sideband (SSB) modulation features high spectral efficiency, substantial dispersion tolerance, and straightforward detection, making it a versatile technology for applications in optical communications, microwave photonics, optical sensing, satellite communication, etc. However, conventional SSB generators typically require two radio-frequency (RF) signals with a 90{\deg} phase difference to drive a pair of parallel phase or amplitude modulators, resulting in high system complexity and low power efficiency. In this paper, we propose and realize a simplified SSB generation scheme necessitating only a single RF drive, by achieving effective RF phase shift using on-chip optical delay lines. This approach not only reduces system complexity and saves energy consumption by 3 dB, but also enables easy scalability to higher frequencies. We demonstrate both full-carrier SSB (FC-SSB) and carrier-suppressed SSB (CS-SSB) modulation on thin-film lithium niobate platform. For FC-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.1 dB at 50 GHz and apply it to address the frequency-selective power fading problem in optical communication systems. For CS-SSB, we show a maximum sideband suppression of 22.5 dB and a sideband-to-carrier suppression of 16.9 dB at 50 GHz, which can act as an optical frequency shifter by sweeping the modulation frequencies. Moreover, the shifted optical frequency can be transferred back to the electrical domain by beating with a reference signal generated via a phase modulator on the same chip, achieving broadband RF frequency shifting from a maximum of 50 GHz down to 1 GHz. Our simple, power-efficient, and low-cost SSB modulation scheme could provide an effective solution for future high-frequency direct detection-based communication systems, frequency-modulated continuous wave radar/LiDAR, optical vector network analyzers, and microwave photonics systems.</description>

      <title>D-band MUTC Photodiode Module for Ultra-Wideband 160 Gbps Photonics-Assisted Fiber-THz Integrated Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>

      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$ T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$ MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <title>On the distributed resistor-constant phase element transmission line in a reflective bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive and study the analytical solution of the voltage and current diffusion equation for the case of a finite-length resistor-constant phase element (CPE) transmission line (TL) circuit that can represent a model for porous electrodes in the absence of any Faradic processes. The energy storage component is considered to be an elemental CPE per unit length of impedance $z_c(s)={1}/{(c_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})}$ instead of the ideal capacitor usually assumed in TL modeling. The problem becomes a time-fractional diffusion equation that we solve under galvanostatic charging, and derive from it a reduced impedance function of the form $z_{\alpha}(s_n)=s_n^{-\alpha/2}\coth({s_n^{\alpha/2}})$, where $s_n = j\omega_n$ is a normalized frequency. We also derive the system's step response, and the distribution function of relaxation times associated with it.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the textural atomization process of a rocket engine assisted coaxial jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for analyzing liquid ligaments of a textural atomization process is presented in this article for the case of a rocket engine type assisted atomization process under combustion. The operating point positions the atomization process in the fiber type regime carrying an intense textural atomization process. Multiscale in nature, the method based on image analysis associates a scale distribution with a family of ligaments, this distribution being sensitive to the number, size and shape of these ligaments. The quality of scale distributions measured by image analysis depends on the spatial resolution and the precision of area measurements of surfaces with curved boundaries but described by square pixels. Part of the work consisted of improving the method for measuring scale distributions by using a subpixel image analysis technique and refining the surface area measurement method. Another part directed the multiscale analysis towards the estimation of the diameter distributions of the blobs that characterize the large-scale deformation of the ligaments. The analysis describes the atomization process at a level of detail never reached. For instance, assuming that the blobs are drops in formation, the estimated diameter distribution (bimodal in the case examined here) as well as the number of these drops are evaluated as a function of the distance from the injector. This information indicates where the process is most intense and where it stops. Furthermore, these diameter distributions receive a mathematical expression whose parameters report clear evolutions with the distance from the injector. This shows the possibility of elaborating mathematical models appropriate for textural atomization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polaronic exciton in A-type 2D van der Waals bulk material CrSBr</title>

Abstract: 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr exhibits unique magneto-optical properties, yet its electronic structure and photophysical mechanisms remain unclear at high magnetic field and low temperature. Through comprehensive spectroscopic investigations, its charge-transfer band edge is identified at 500 nm. Below this band-edge, local excitonic magnetic polaronic states from Cr3+ ions out of FM aggregates in layer and bilayer could be seen due to phonon-spin-exciton coupling, in which magnetic polaronic PL1 emission occurs at 720 nm from single Cr3+ d-d transition, a dark-state pair exciton occurs at 850 nm in 10 K magnetic field, and double-peak PL2 emission at 920 nm out of Cr3+ FM trimer in monolayer is seen; besides, the magnetic bi-polaronic PL3 at 990 nm can be assigned to Cr3+ tetramers between FM adjacent layers. In magnetic field perpendicular to the layer, direct competition between PL1and dark-state excitons and PL2 and PL3 excitonic states persist in different temperatures. This study sheds light on the complicated magneto-exciton interactions in the multi-body effect of CrSBr, beneficial for quantum modulation in layered magnetic semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low-loss slow-light thin-film lithium-niobate optical modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators for next-generation optical interconnects require low loss-efficiency products, compact footprints, high modulation efficiency, broad bandwidths, and low losses. Here we propose and demonstrate a low-loss high-efficiency thin-film lithium-niobate Mach Zehnder modulator enabled by a novel ultralow-loss slow-light structure based on apodized gratings in cascade. The present loss-engineered slow-light structure achieves excess losses as low as 0.6 dB/mm experimentally, which is tens of times lower than conventional slow-light structures, and a high modulation bandwidth up to 320GHz in theory is achieved with optimally-designed capacitively-loaded traveling-wave electrodes. Experimentally, the fabricated slow-light modulator with a 2.8-mm-long modulation region has an ultra-low loss-efficiency product of 7.4 VdB and a flat electro-optic response up to 67 GHz, enabling 100-Gbps on-off keying with high ERs of 4.5 dB at a low driving voltage of 2Vpp, while 200-Gbps PAM4 and 150-Gbps PAM8 signals are also generated to show great promise for advanced modulation formats. In particular, it has also achieved the highest figure-of-merit(FOM) of 182 for high-speed optical modulation , including the bit rate, the extinction ratio normalized with respective to Vpp, the modulation efficiency. The outstanding performance of the present apodized-grating-based slow-light modulator shows great potential and paves the way for developing high-speed optical interconnects for both data-centers and high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Formulation of Frequency-Dependent Average Force in AM-AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) measures nanoscale surface structures by detecting changes in the cantilever oscillation amplitude, contributing to materials research. AM-AFM can non-destructively observe fragile molecules, such as biomolecules, even while the probe is in intermittent contact with the sample. However, it remains unclear why the tip-sample interaction force estimated from an experimental amplitude value is substantially greater than the actual molecular binding force, despite the successful visualization of molecular dynamics. Here, we formulate a quantitative force conversion equation for arbitrary driving frequencies. Comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that when the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope, the conventional equation overestimates the actual force by approximately five times, as it is valid only for excitation at the resonance frequency. The theory is validated by simulations and experiments and can be applied to various AM-AFM applications in materials research.</description>

      <title>A Mechanical Route for Cooperative Transport in Autonomous Robotic Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale, reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled robots. Robots deprived of sensing and communication, are isotropically initialized around a passive circular payload, where directional motion is not expected without an external cue. And yet it moves. We find that a minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show experimentally that by controlling the individual's friction and mass distribution, a swarm of active particles autonomously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects. Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size, and its persistence surpasses the persistence of the active particles by over an order of magnitude. A mechanical, coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed light on cooperation in natural swarms.</description>

      <title>Realization of High-Fidelity CZ Gate based on a Double-Transmon Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction. A recently proposed theoretical scheme, the double-transmon coupler (DTC), aims to achieve both suppressed residual interaction and a fast high-fidelity two-qubit gate simultaneously, particularly for highly detuned qubits. Harnessing the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and a model-free pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.90% for a CZ gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>
