      <title>Kinetic Theory of Multicomponent Ostwald Ripening in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially miscible bubble populations trapped in porous media are ubiquitous in subsurface applications such as underground hydrogen storage (UHS), where cyclic injections fragment gas into numerous bubbles with distributions of sizes and compositions. These bubbles exchange mass through Ostwald ripening, driven by differences in composition and interfacial curvature. While kinetic theories have been developed for single-component ripening in porous media, accounting for bubble deformation and spatial correlations in pore size, no such theory exists for multicomponent systems. We present the first kinetic theory for multicomponent Ostwald ripening of bubbles in porous media. The formulation describes the bubble population with a number-density function $g(s; t)$ in a 3D statistical space of bubble states $s = (R_p, S^b, y)$, consisting of pore size, bubble saturation, and composition. Evolution is governed by a population balance equation with closure through mean-field approximations that account for spatial correlations in pore size and ensure mass conservation. The theory generalizes previous single-component formulations, removing key limitations such as the inability to capture interactions between distant bubbles. Systematic validation against pore-network simulations across homogeneous, heterogeneous, correlated, and uncorrelated networks demonstrates good agreement without adjustable parameters. Pending challenges and limitations are discussed. Since the theory imposes no constraints on bubble count or correlation length, it enables predictions beyond the pore scale.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of rod-like particles in complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion of particles in complex fluids and gels is difficult to describe and often lies beyond the scope of the classical Stokes-Einstein relation. One of the main lines of research over the past few decades has sought to relate diffusivity to a fundamental dissipative property of the fluid: the wave-vector-dependent shear viscosity function. Here, we use linear response theory to extend this viscosity function framework to rod-like particles. Using a dimer (two-bead particle) as a minimal rod-like probe, we derive explicit expressions for its diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to its axis in terms of the viscosity function. We show that this description captures the full range of behaviors, from nearly isotropic diffusion of the rod-like probe to highly anisotropic, reptation-like motion. The method is based on a microscopic statistical-mechanical treatment of the Smoluchowski dynamics, yet leads to simple final formulas, providing a practical tool for interpreting diffusion experiments on rod-like tracers in complex fluids. We also clarify the limitations of this approach, emphasizing that the present formulation is primarily suited to complex liquids like polymer solutions and only indirectly applicable to gels.</description>

      <title>The effects of solvent quality and core wetting on the circularization of star polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of cyclical arms in star polymers, focusing on the effects of solvent quality on their resulting linking complexity and gyration radius. We find that polymers circularized in bad solvent present a higher degree of linking among arms with respect to those circularized in good solvent. When both are transported to good solvent, this results in a smaller gyration radius of the former with respect to the latter. This effect is magnified when the polymers present a sufficiently small number of arms (or functionality $f$): in this case, in bad solvent, all arms tend to clump together on one side of the central core, due to circularization, and can hence all interact with each other. Instead, when $f$ is large enough, the whole surface of the core is wetted by the arms, whose distribution becomes radially symmetric. This hinders interactions between faraway arms and reduces the probability of inter-arm linking. Interestingly, we find that both the critical $f_c$ at which the clump transition happens and the minimal arm length $n_c$ for which the transition appears depend on the core size: the grafting density of the arms must be larger than a certain constant $\rho_g^c$, while their length must be sufficient to stretch for, at least, half of the core's circumference.</description>

      <title>Programmable Hydrodynamics of Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled microparticles create flow fields that determine how they interact with surfaces, external flows, and each other. These flow fields fall into distinct classes--pushers, pullers, and neutral swimmers--each exhibiting fundamentally different collective behaviors. In all existing synthetic systems, this hydrodynamic character is permanently set during fabrication, making it impossible to explore how adaptive switching between these classes might enable new functions or emergent phenomena.
  Here we demonstrate that the hydrodynamic character of a microswimmer can be programmed and switched on demand. Using patterned laser heating of surface-bound nanoparticles, we create tailored temperature gradients that drive controllable boundary flows at the particle surface. By changing the illumination pattern in real time, we dynamically transform the swimmers flow field continuously tuning from pusher to puller, while the particle continues to swim. Flow measurements confirm quantitative agreement with theory and allow us to simultaneously track how symmetry, power consumption, and efficiency change across modes. This control over hydrodynamic modes opens experimental access to questions that have remained largely theoretical: How do adaptive swimmers respond to crowding or confinement? Can mixtures with tunable pusher-puller ratios reveal new collective states? Our approach provides a platform to address these questions and explore the morphological developments of active matter systems under external physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Friedel-like oscillations from Lorenz dynamics in walking droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friedel oscillations are spatially decaying density modulations near localized defects and are a hallmark of quantum systems. Walking droplets provide a macroscopic platform for hydrodynamic quantum analogs, and Friedel-like oscillations were recently observed in droplet-defect scattering experiments through wave-mediated speed modulation [P.~J.~S\'aenz \textit{et al.}, \textit{Sci.\ Adv.} \textbf{6}, eay9234 (2020)]. Here we show that Friedel-like statistics can also arise from a purely local, dynamical mechanism, which we elucidate using a minimal Lorenz-like model of a walking droplet. In this model, a localized defect perturbs the particle's internal dynamical state, generating underdamped velocity oscillations that give rise to oscillatory ensemble position statistics. This attractor-driven, local mechanism opens new avenues for hydrodynamic quantum analogs based on active particles with internal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy with 80 $\mu$s Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Tau Pulsed Illumination Differential Dynamic Microscopy (MTPI-DDM) is introduced as a method for significantly enhancing the time resolution of DDM. The technique employs simple, low-cost instrumentation comprising a single monochrome digital camera and a single pulsed LED. A timing sequence, based on a geometric progression of time lags, is used to generate a "multi-tau" scheme, providing high sampling density at short timescales where dynamics are fastest. In the current implementation, a temporal resolution of 80 $\mu$s is achieved, limited by the dead time of the camera electronics. Validation of MTPI-DDM was performed by measuring the diffusion of 99 nm polystyrene nanoparticles in water. Compared to conventional continuous-wave (CW) DDM, the pulsed approach extends the range of the shortest measurable time lags by nearly two orders of magnitude and enhances DDM signal amplitudes by eliminating motion blur.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>

      <title>Dynamical arrest in active nematic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids display spontaneous turbulent-like flows known as active turbulence. Recent work revealed that these flows have universal features, independent of the material properties and of the presence of topological defects. However, the differences between defect-laden and defect-free active turbulence remain largely unexplored. Here, by means of large-scale numerical simulations, we show that defect-free active nematic turbulence can undergo dynamical arrest. This state is characterized by an emergent network of nematic domain walls that channels coherent streams and suppresses chaotic flows. As the system evolves, the branched wall network produces a large-scale pattern with tree-like topological properties. We find that flow alignment -- the tendency of nematics to reorient under shear -- enhances large-scale chaotic jets in contractile rodlike systems while promoting dynamical arrest in extensile systems. We further show that dynamical arrest persists regardless of whether defects are prohibited by construction or simply fail to form due to a high energy cost of defect cores. Taken together, our findings reveal a striking pattern-formation mechanism, with labyrinths emerging from active turbulence, and illuminate the rich transitional regime between defect-free and defect-laden dynamics. These behaviors call for the experimental realization of active nematics at vanishing or low defect densities, and underscore that, in extensile rodlike nematics, topological defects enable turbulence by preventing dynamical arrest.</description>

      <title>Collective behaviors of self-propelled particles with tunable alignment angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel aligning active matter model by extending the nematic alignment rule in self-propelled rods to tunable alignment angles, as represented by collision of cone-shaped particles. Non-vanishing alignment angles introduce frustration in the many-body interactions, and we investigate its effect on the collective behavior of the system. Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range. The linear stability analysis of the continuum description derived from the Boltzmann approach demonstrates qualitative consistency with the microscopic model, while frustration due to many-body interactions in the latter destabilizes homogeneous nematic order over a wide range of the alignment angle.</description>

      <title>State Diagram of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model and the Effects of Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions between active particles may be non-reciprocal, breaking action-reaction symmetry and leading to novel physics not observed in equilibrium systems. The non-reciprocalCahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model is a phenomenological model that captures the large-scale effects of non-reciprocity in conserved, phase-separating systems. In this work, we explore the consequences of different variations of this model corresponding to different symmetries, inspired by the importance of symmetry in equilibrium universality classes. In particular, we contrast two models, one with a continuous SO(2) symmetry and one with a discrete C_4 symmetry. We analyze the corresponding models by constructing three-dimensional linear stability diagrams. With this, we connect the models with their equilibrium limits, highlight the role of mean composition, and classify qualitatively different instabilities. We further demonstrate how non-reciprocity gives rise to out-of-equilibrium steady states with non-zero currents and present representative closed-form solutions that help us understand characteristic features of the models in different parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</description>

      <title>On the interaction of dilatancy and friction in the behavior of fluid-saturated sheared granular materials: a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics--Discrete Element Method study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frictional instabilities in fluid saturated granular materials underlie natural hazards, including submarine landslides and earthquake initiation. Experiments show distinct failure behaviors under subaerial and subaqueous conditions due to coupled deformation, interparticle friction, and particle fluid interactions. We use three-dimensional coupled computational fluid dynamics, discrete element method (CFD - DEM) to investigate collapse and runout of dense and loose granular assemblies in both environments. Parametric analyses show that pore pressure evolution controls failure mode in saturated settings (fast vs slow sliding), consistent with prior laboratory experiments and lattice Boltzmann discrete element simulations: dense assemblies stabilize via dilation, whereas loose assemblies compact rapidly and transiently fluidize. At mesoscale, we coarse grain particle contact statistics and Eulerian fluid fields to define apparent friction and normalized pore pressure, and organize inertial and viscous responses using log10(In/Iv). Spatiotemporal analyses of these coarse grained fields reveal strain rate dependent behavior governed by evolving porosity and effective stress. In both environments, friction in failure shear zone is rate-strengthening with respect to inertial number (In, for dry) and viscous number (Iv, for fluid-saturated). We further utilize mesoscale stress framework to compare evolution of pore pressure in CFD - DEM of subaqueous slope collapse with an analytical solution for development of failure front, using inputs derived from numerical triaxial DEM tests on same assemblies. The analytical model reproduces steady-state excess pore pressures and captures fluid-particle coupling, but mismatch near failure onset suggests transient frictional effects. These results support physics-based hazard models and improve mechanistic understanding of saturated granular failure.</description>

      <title>Convective Flows in Sheared Packings of Spherical Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials respond to shear stress remains a central challenge in soft matter physics. We report direct observations of persistent granular convection in the bulk shear zones of spherical particle packings -- a phenomenon previously associated primarily with particle shape anisotropy or boundary effects. By employing various bead-coloring techniques in a split-bottom geometry, we reveal internal flow fields within sheared granular packings. We find robust convection rolls, strikingly governed by system geometry: at low filling heights, two counter-rotating convection rolls emerge, while at higher filling heights, a single dominant convection roll forms, featuring radially outward flow at the surface. This transition is driven by the height-dependent broadening of the shear zone, which introduces shear rate asymmetry across its flanks. Notably, the transition occurs entirely within the open shear band regime. These findings underscore the pivotal role of system geometry in shaping secondary flow formation in dense packings of frictional particles, suggesting possible broader relevance to geophysical flow dynamics and industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>

Abstract: In this work we develop constitutive equations for a dense, sheared suspension of frictionally interacting rods by applying Onsager's variational method as formulated by Doi. We treat both solid friction, of the Amontons-Coulomb form; and lubricated friction, which scales with relative tangential velocity at the contact point. Dissipation functions in terms of the rod angular velocity are derived via a mean field approach for each form of friction, and from these, a Rayleighian for dense suspensions of rigid rods under shear constructed. Derivatives of this Rayleighian with respect to rod angular velocity and velocity gradient give a Smoluchowski equation and stress tensor, respectively. We show that these are representable as perturbations to Doi's model for a sheared liquid crystal. We also suggest a form for the average number of contacts between rods as a function of volume fraction, aspect ratio, and nematic order parameter, generalizing Philipse's random contact equation for disordered packings.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures. Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact 3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables. Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar parallel walls.</description>
