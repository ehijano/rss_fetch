      <title>On the Radiation Effects of Strontium Ions on Satellite Solar Cells in Low Earth Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the radiation effects of Sr+ ions--generated from high-altitude nuclear explosions (HANE)--on satellite solar cells in low-Earth orbits (LEO). Along four selected satellite orbits, ion fluences are sampled inside the evolving Sr+ ion distributions for days, determined from our newly developed HANE environment model. These fluences, along with the help of radiation transport codes including the MULASSIS and SRIM models, enable us to quantify the radiation damages by determining the values of total ionizing doses and the equivalent 1 MeV electron fluences for displacement damages. Comparing the dose values to existing experimental data, we conclude that HANE-generated Sr+ ions have limited darkening effects to quartz solar cell coverglasses in LEO with apogees of 100s to 1000 km. In addition, with the extremely high equivalent fluences, we also conclude that these Sr ions may cause severe or even fatal displacement damage to exposed solar photovoltaic (PV) cells on satellites in LEO. The radiation effects of Sr+ ions are much less significant for the orbits with high apogees beyond ten thousand km. We also conducted model parameter sensitivity studies on the charge exchange cross-sections, neutral atmosphere density profiles and explosion local time positions, and the above conclusions stay unchanged. The methodology developed in this study can be extended to other HANE-generated heavy ion species in the future.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Particle Transport at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>
