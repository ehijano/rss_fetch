      <title>Modeling Maximum drawdown Records with Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processe in Capital Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to model the records of the maximum Drawdown in capital markets by means a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). We derive statistical results such as the mean and variance that describes the sequence of maximum Drawdown records. In addition, we developed a simulation study and techniques for estimating the parameters governing the stochastic process, using a practical example in the capital market to illustrate the procedure.</description>

      <title>A cost of capital approach to determining the LGD discount rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss Given Default (LGD) is a key risk parameter in determining a bank's regulatory capital. During LGD-estimation, realised recovery cash flows are to be discounted at an appropriate rate. Regulatory guidance mandates that this rate should allow for the time value of money, as well as include a risk premium that reflects the "undiversifiable risk" within these recoveries. Having extensively reviewed earlier methods of determining this rate, we propose a new approach that is inspired by the cost of capital approach from the Solvency II regulatory regime. Our method involves estimating a market-consistent price for a portfolio of defaulted loans, from which an associated discount rate may be inferred. We apply this method to mortgage and personal loans data from a large South African bank. The results reveal the main drivers of the discount rate to be the mean and variance of these recoveries, as well as the bank's cost of capital in excess of the risk-free rate. Our method therefore produces a discount rate that reflects both the undiversifiable risk of recovery recoveries and the time value of money, thereby satisfying regulatory requirements. This work can subsequently enhance the LGD-component within the modelling of both regulatory and economic capital.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Mitigating Agricultural Price Volatility Using Climate Scenarios and Risk Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural price volatility challenges sustainable finance, planning, and policy, driven by market dynamics and meteorological factors such as temperature and precipitation. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging mechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP, leveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results underscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling, supporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural finance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing, stabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing climate uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Liquidity Jump, Liquidity Diffusion, and Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new framework to detect wash trading in crypto assets through real-time liquidity fluctuation. We propose that short-term price jumps in crypto assets results from wash trading-induced liquidity fluctuation, and construct two complementary liquidity measures, liquidity jump (size of fluctuation) and liquidity diffusion (volatility of fluctuation), to capture the behavioral signature of wash trading. Using US stocks as a benchmark, we demonstrate that joint elevation in both liquidity metrics indicates wash trading in crypto assets. A simulated regulatory treatment that removes likely wash trades confirms this dynamic: it reduces liquidity diffusion significantly while leaving liquidity jump largely unaffected. These findings align with a theoretical model in which manipulative traders amplify both the level and variance of price pressure, whereas passive investors affect only the level. Our model offers practical tools for investors to assess market quality and for regulators to monitor manipulation risk on crypto exchanges without oversight.</description>

      <title>Dynamic spillovers and investment strategies across artificial intelligence ETFs, artificial intelligence tokens, and green markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the risk spillovers among AI ETFs, AI tokens, and green markets using the R2 decomposition method. We reveal several key insights. First, the overall transmission connectedness index (TCI) closely aligns with the contemporaneous TCI, while the lagged TCI is significantly lower. Second, AI ETFs and clean energy act as risk transmitters, whereas AI tokens and green bond function as risk receivers. Third, AI tokens are difficult to hedge and provide limited hedging ability compared to AI ETFs and green assets. However, multivariate portfolios effectively reduce AI tokens investment risk. Among them, the minimum correlation portfolio outperforms the minimum variance and minimum connectedness portfolios.</description>
