      <title>Secrecy Analysis of CSI Ratio-Based Transmitter Selection with Unreliable Backhaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the secrecy performance of a multi-transmitter system with unreliable backhaul links. To improve secrecy, we propose a novel transmitter selection (TS) scheme that selects a transmitter with the maximum ratio of the destination channel power gain to the eavesdropping channel power gain. The backhaul reliability factor is incorporated with the distribution of the channel power gain through the utilization of a mixture distribution. We evaluate the non-zero secrecy rate (NZR) and the secrecy outage probability (SOP) as well as their asymptotes in two scenarios of backhaul activity knowledge, where it is available and where it is unavailable. The results illustrate that because of the unreliable backhaul, the proposed destination-to-eavesdropper channel power gain ratio-based TS scheme is constrained in terms of secrecy performance. However, performance enhancements are observed when the backhaul knowledge activity is utilized. Furthermore, the proposed scheme outperforms all the sub-optimal TS schemes and achieves nearly optimal performance without requiring noise power or the evaluation of the exact secrecy rate measurement.</description>

      <title>Location-Driven Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless communications are promising to support ubiquitous connections and high data rates with cost-effective devices. Benefiting from the energy-efficient elements with low cost, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerges as a potential solution to fulfill such demands, which has the capability to flexibly manipulate the wireless signals with a tunable phase. Recently, as the operational frequency ascends to the sub-terahertz (THz) bands or higher bands for wireless communications in six-generation (6G), it becomes imperative to consider the near-field propagation in RIS-assisted communications. The challenging acquisition of channel parameters is an inherent issue for near-field RIS-assisted communications, where the complex design is essential to acquire the informative near-field channel embedded with both the angle and distance information. Hence, in this paper we systematically investigate the potential of exploiting location information for near-field RIS-assisted communications. Firstly, we present the progresses in the near-field RIS-assisted communications, which are compatible with existing wireless communications and show the potential to achieve the fine-grained localization accuracy to support location-driven scheme. Then, the Fresnel zone based model is introduced, with which the location-driven beamforming scheme and corresponding frame structure are developed. Also, we elaborate on four unique advantages for leveraging location information in RIS-assisted communications, followed by numerical simulations. Finally, several key challenges and corresponding potential solutions are pointed out.</description>

      <title>On Jacob Ziv's Individual-Sequence Approach to Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article stands as a tribute to the enduring legacy of Jacob Ziv and his landmark contributions to information theory. Specifically, it delves into the groundbreaking individual-sequence approach -- a cornerstone of Ziv's academic pursuits. Together with Abraham Lempel, Ziv pioneered the renowned Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm, a beacon of innovation in various versions. Beyond its original domain of universal data compression, this article underscores the broad utility of the individual-sequence approach and the LZ algorithm across a wide spectrum of problem areas. As we traverse through the forthcoming pages, it will also become evident how Ziv's visionary approach has left an indelible mark on my own research journey, as well as on those of numerous colleagues and former students. We shall explore, not only the technical power of the LZ algorithm, but also its profound impact on shaping the landscape of information theory and its applications.</description>

      <title>Huygens-Fresnel Model Based Position-Aided Phase Configuration for 1-Bit RIS Assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), composed of nearly passive elements, is regarded as one of the potential paradigms to support multi-gigabit data in real-time. However, in traditional CSI (channel state information) driven frame, the training overhead of channel estimation greatly increases as the number of RIS elements increases to intelligently manipulate the reflected signals. To conveniently use the reflected signal without complex CSI feedback, in this paper we propose a position-aided phase configuration scheme based on the property of Fresnel zone. In particular, we design the impedance based discrete RIS elements with joint absorption mode and reflection mode considering the fabrication complexities, which integrated the property of the Fresnel zone to resist the impact of position error. Then, with joint absorption and 1-bit reflection mode elements, we develop the two-step position-aided ON/OFF states judgement (TPOSJ) scheme and the frame structure to control the ON/OFF state of RIS, followed by analyzing the impacts of mobility and position error on our proposed scheme. Also, we derive the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral theorem based power flow. Simulations show that the proposed scheme can manipulate the ON/OFF state intelligently without complex CSI, thus verifying the practical application of our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Lossless Image Compression Using Multi-level Dictionaries: Binary Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossless image compression is required in various applications to reduce storage or transmission costs of images, while requiring the reconstructed images to have zero information loss compared to the original. Existing lossless image compression methods either have simple design but poor compression performance, or complex design, better performance, but with no performance guarantees. In our endeavor to develop a lossless image compression method with low complexity and guaranteed performance, we argue that compressibility of a color image is essentially derived from the patterns in its spatial structure, intensity variations, and color variations. Thus, we divide the overall design of a lossless image compression scheme into three parts that exploit corresponding redundancies. We further argue that the binarized version of an image captures its fundamental spatial structure and in this work, we propose a scheme for lossless compression of binary images.
  The proposed scheme first learns dictionaries of $16\times16$, $8\times8$, $4\times4$, and $2\times 2$ square pixel patterns from various datasets of binary images. It then uses these dictionaries to encode binary images. These dictionaries have various interesting properties that are further exploited to construct an efficient scheme. Our preliminary results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing conventional and learning based lossless compression approaches, and provides, on average, as much as $1.5\times$ better performance than a common general purpose lossless compression scheme (WebP), more than $3\times$ better performance than a state of the art learning based scheme, and better performance than a specialized scheme for binary image compression (JBIG2).</description>

      <title>A Data and Model-Driven Deep Learning Approach to Robust Downlink Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of the long-standing probabilistically robust transmit beamforming problem with channel uncertainties in the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink transmission. This problem poses significant analytical and computational challenges. Currently, the state-of-the-art optimization method relies on convex restrictions as tractable approximations to ensure robustness against Gaussian channel uncertainties. However, this method not only exhibits high computational complexity and suffers from the rank relaxation issue but also yields conservative solutions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning-based approach that incorporates the sampling of channel uncertainties in the training process to optimize the probabilistic system performance. We introduce a model-driven learning approach that defines a new beamforming structure with trainable parameters to account for channel uncertainties. Additionally, we employ a graph neural network to efficiently infer the key beamforming parameters. We successfully apply this approach to the minimum rate quantile maximization problem subject to outage and total power constraints. Furthermore, we propose a bisection search method to address the more challenging power minimization problem with probabilistic rate constraints by leveraging the aforementioned approach. Numerical results confirm that our approach achieves non-conservative robust performance, higher data rates, greater power efficiency, and faster execution compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.</description>

      <title>The strong data processing inequality under the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ and $\mu$ be probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\nu_s,\mu_s$ be their evolution under the heat flow, that is, the probability distributions resulting from convolving their density with the density of an isotropic Gaussian random vector with variance $s$ in each entry. This paper studies the rate of decay of $s\mapsto D(\nu_s\|\mu_s)$ for various divergences, including the $\chi^2$ and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences. We prove upper and lower bounds on the strong data-processing inequality (SDPI) coefficients corresponding to the source $\mu$ and the Gaussian channel. We also prove generalizations of de Brujin's identity, and Costa's result on the concavity in $s$ of the differential entropy of $\nu_s$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain new lower bounds on the mutual information between $X$ and $Y=X+\sqrt{s} Z$, where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, independent of $X$, and on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in estimating $X$ from $Y$, in terms of the Poincar\'e constant of $X$.</description>

      <title>CSI-GPT: Integrating Generative Pre-Trained Transformer with Federated-Tuning to Acquire Downlink Massive MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, how to reliably acquire downlink channel state information (CSI) with low overhead is challenging. In this work, by integrating the generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) with federated-tuning, we propose a CSI-GPT approach to realize efficient downlink CSI acquisition. Specifically, we first propose a Swin Transformer-based channel acquisition network (SWTCAN) to acquire downlink CSI, where pilot signals, downlink channel estimation, and uplink CSI feedback are jointly designed. Furthermore, to solve the problem of insufficient training data, we propose a variational auto-encoder-based channel sample generator (VAE-CSG), which can generate sufficient CSI samples based on a limited number of high-quality CSI data obtained from the current cell. The CSI dataset generated from VAE-CSG will be used for pre-training SWTCAN. To fine-tune the pre-trained SWTCAN for improved performance, we propose an online federated-tuning method, where only a small amount of SWTCAN parameters are unfrozen and updated using over-the-air computation, avoiding the high communication overhead caused by aggregating the complete CSI samples from user equipment (UEs) to the BS for centralized fine-tuning. Simulation results verify the advantages of the proposed SWTCAN and the communication efficiency of the proposed federated-tuning method.</description>

      <title>Local to Global: Learning Dynamics and Effect of Initialization for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based models have revolutionized deep learning, particularly in sequence modeling. To better understand this phenomenon, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study transformers. However, our current understanding in this regard remains limited with many fundamental questions about how transformers learn Markov chains still unanswered. In this paper, we address this by focusing on first-order Markov chains and single-layer transformers, providing a comprehensive characterization of the learning dynamics in this context. Specifically, we prove that transformer parameters trained on next-token prediction loss can either converge to global or local minima, contingent on the initialization and the Markovian data properties, and we characterize the precise conditions under which this occurs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind highlighting the role of initialization. We further demonstrate that our theoretical findings are corroborated by empirical evidence. Based on these insights, we provide guidelines for the initialization of transformer parameters and demonstrate their effectiveness. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

      <title>Task-Oriented Wireless Communications for Collaborative Perception in Intelligent Unmanned Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has shown great potential to achieve more holistic and reliable environmental perception in intelligent unmanned systems (IUSs). However, implementing CP still faces key challenges due to the characteristics of the CP task and the dynamics of wireless channels. In this article, a task-oriented wireless communication framework is proposed to jointly optimize the communication scheme and the CP procedure. We first propose channel-adaptive compression and robust fusion approaches to extract and exploit the most valuable semantic information under wireless communication constraints. We then propose a task-oriented distributed scheduling algorithm to identify the best collaborators for CP under dynamic environments. The main idea is learning while scheduling, where the collaboration utility is effectively learned with low computation and communication overhead. Case studies are carried out in connected autonomous driving scenarios to verify the proposed framework. Finally, we identify several future research directions.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Beam-Squint in ISAC: Causes, Implications, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a means to efficiently utilize spectrum and thereby save cost and power. At the higher end of the spectrum, ISAC systems operate at wideband using large antenna arrays to meet the stringent demands for high-resolution sensing and enhanced communications capacity. However, the wideband implementation entails beam-squint, that is, deviations in the generated beam directions because of the narrowband assumption in the analog components. This causes significant degradation in the communications capacity, target detection, and parameter estimation. This article presents the design challenges caused by beam-squint and its mitigation in ISAC systems. In this context, we also discuss several ISAC design perspectives including far-/near-field beamforming, channel/direction estimation, sparse array design, and index modulation. There are also several research opportunities in waveform design, beam training, and array processing to adequately address beam-squint in ISAC.</description>

      <title>Doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information: Properties and operational interpretation from strong converse exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we deepen the study of properties of the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information, which is defined as the minimization of the sandwiched divergence of order $\alpha$ of a fixed bipartite state relative to any product state. In particular, we prove a novel duality relation for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$ by employing Sion's minimax theorem, and we prove additivity for $\alpha\in [\frac{2}{3},\infty]$. Previously, additivity was only known for $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$, but has been conjectured for $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$. Furthermore, we show that the doubly minimized sandwiched Renyi mutual information of order $\alpha\in [1,\infty]$ attains operational meaning in the context of binary quantum state discrimination as it is linked to certain strong converse exponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in designing channel codes has been driven by human ingenuity and, fittingly, has been sporadic. Polar codes, developed on the foundation of Arikan's polarization kernel, represent the latest breakthrough in coding theory and have emerged as the state-of-the-art error-correction code for short-to-medium block length regimes. In an effort to automate the invention of good channel codes, especially in this regime, we explore a novel, non-linear generalization of Polar codes, which we call DeepPolar codes. DeepPolar codes extend the conventional Polar coding framework by utilizing a larger kernel size and parameterizing these kernels and matched decoders through neural networks. Our results demonstrate that these data-driven codes effectively leverage the benefits of a larger kernel size, resulting in enhanced reliability when compared to both existing neural codes and conventional Polar codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have recently been used to construct non-linear codes for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. However, there is limited understanding of how these black-box-like codes with many learned parameters use feedback. This study aims to uncover the fundamental principles underlying the first deep-learned feedback code, known as Deepcode, which is based on an RNN architecture. Our interpretable model based on Deepcode is built by analyzing the influence length of inputs and approximating the non-linear dynamics of the original black-box RNN encoder. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our interpretable model -- which includes both an encoder and a decoder -- achieves comparable performance to Deepcode while offering an interpretation of how it employs feedback for error correction.</description>

      <title>Enzymatic cycle-based receivers with high input impedance for approximate maximum a posteriori demodulation of concentration modulated signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication is a bio-inspired communication paradigm where molecules are used as the information carrier. This paper considers a molecular communication network where the transmitter uses concentration modulated signals for communication. Our focus is to design receivers that can demodulate these signals. We impose three features on our receivers. We want the receivers to use enzymatic cycles as their building blocks, have high input impedance and can work approximately as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) demodulator. No receivers with all these three features exist in the current molecular communication literature. We consider enzymatic cycles because they are a very common class of chemical reactions that are found in living cells. Since a receiver is to be placed in the communication environment, it should ideally have a high input impedance so that it has minimal impact on the environment and on other receivers. Lastly, a MAP receiver has good statistical performance. In this paper, we show how we can use time-scale separation to make an enzymatic cycle to have high input impedance and how the parameters of the enzymatic cycles can be chosen so that the receiver can approximately implement a MAP demodulator. We use simulation to study the performance of this receiver. In particular, we consider an environment with multiple receivers and show that a receiver has little impact on the bit error ratio of a nearby receiver because they have high input impedance.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalized Automorphism Belief Propagation Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing demands on future wireless systems, new design objectives become eminent. Low-density parity-check codes together with belief propagation (BP) decoding have outstanding performance for large block lengths. Yet, for future wireless systems, good decoding performance for short block lengths is mandatory, a regime in which BP decoding typically shows a significant gap to maximum likelihood decoding. Automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) is known to reduce this gap effectively and, in addition, enables an easy trade-off between latency, throughput, and complexity. Recently, generalized AED (GAED) was proposed to increase the set of feasible automorphisms suitable for ensemble decoding. By construction, GAED requires a preprocessing step within its constituent paths that results in information loss and potentially limits the gains of GAED. In this work, we show that the preprocessing step can be merged with the Tanner graph of BP decoding, thereby improving the performance of the constituent paths. Finally, we show that the improvement of the individual paths also enhances the overall performance of the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Applications of Information Inequalities to Database Theory Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper describes several applications of information inequalities to problems in database theory. The problems discussed include: upper bounds of a query's output, worst-case optimal join algorithms, the query domination problem, and the implication problem for approximate integrity constraints. The paper is self-contained: all required concepts and results from information inequalities are introduced here, gradually, and motivated by database problems.</description>

      <title>Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Weakly Communicating and General Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. For weakly communicating MDPs, we establish the complexity bound $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{H}{\varepsilon^2} )$, where $H$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,H$, and $\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. We also initiate the study of sample complexity in general (multichain) average-reward MDPs. We argue a new transient time parameter $B$ is necessary, establish an $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{B + H}{\varepsilon^2})$ complexity bound, and prove a matching (up to log factors) minimax lower bound. Both results are based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP, which requires new ideas in the general setting. To optimally analyze this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{H}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} )$ and $\widetilde{O}(SA\frac{B + H}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} )$ samples suffice to learn $\varepsilon$-optimal policies in weakly communicating and in general MDPs, respectively. Both these results circumvent the well-known minimax lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2} )$ for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, and establish a quadratic rather than cubic horizon dependence for a fixed MDP instance.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noises. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>
