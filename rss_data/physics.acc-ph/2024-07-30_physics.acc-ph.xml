      <title>Target Development Using the Method of High-Intensity Vibrational Powder Plating (HIVIPP) at the Center for Accelerator Target Science (CATS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary goals of the Center for Accelerator Target Science (CATS) is to provide targets and foils in support of the ATLAS User Facility and the Low-Energy community at large. While a wide array of target production techniques are available at CATS, new methods that must be explored invariably arise. One such technique, the High-Intensity Vibrational Powder Plating (HIVIPP), was first reported in 1997 by Isao Sugai. It was developed to produce targets and stripper foils that were difficult to make by standard methods. At Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), we have successfully constructed and tested a simple system for this purpose. We have produced targets of carbon and titanium on various metal backings using the HIVIPP method. We are currently in the exciting phase of exploring the production of other elements, including isotopically enriched and radioactive material. This work is in progress and will be further detailed with specific examples.</description>

      <title>Hall Effect, Magnetoresistance, and Current Distribution in Quench Heaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench heaters are often an essential part of protecting a superconducting accelerator magnet during a quench. Their purpose is to spread the quench throughout the coil as quickly as possible. They are located in areas of high magnetic fields and are thus prone to magnetoresistive phenomena and the Hall effect. Such influences can cause currents to distribute unevenly in the heaters, which results in uneven heating. This can reduce the effectiveness of the heaters and even endanger them due to excessive local heating. Also, the heater geometry itself can be the cause of uneven current density.
  In this paper we investigate by numerical simulations the importance of the magnetic effects on quench heater performance and whether they should be taken into account in the design. The main interest is in the Hall effect, which was perceived as the most likely source of trouble for the design of quench heaters. We use a simple phenomenological approach for modeling the Hall effect, utilizing values from the literature for the Hall coefficients. Magnetoresistance is also considered and the impact of heater geometry on current distributions is briefly visited.
  The conclusion of this research is that magnetoresistance plays an insignificant role in the functioning of quench heaters. The Hall effect can clearly be more influential, but nevertheless should not pose any problems in most cases. Current distributions due to heater geometry should be take into consideration in the design phase and, if needed, take measures to equalize the current density by using, for example, copper cladding in appropriate locations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of laser wakefield acceleration in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) aiming to produce molybdenum-99 via photonuclear reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the bubble regime demands ultra-short, high-peak-power laser pulses, operation in the self-modulated regime (SM-LWFA) works with more relaxed pulse conditions, albeit at the cost of lower beam quality. Modern laser systems can deliver pulses with durations of a few tens of femtoseconds and peak powers on the order of a few terawatts, at kHz repetition rates. These systems are well-suited for developing SM-LWFA applications where high average energy and charge are prioritized over beam quality. Such beams could be used to generate high-energy bremsstrahlung photons, capable of triggering photonuclear reactions to produce radioisotopes like molybdenum-99. This isotope decays into technetium-99m, the most widely used medical radioisotope, with over 30 million applications worldwide per year. This work explores the use of Bayesian optimization to maximize the energy and charge of electron beams accelerated via SM-LWFA. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations model a 5 TW, 15 fs-long Gaussian laser pulse, propagating through tailored hydrogen gas-density profiles. In these simulations, over multiple iterations, the algorithm optimizes a set of input parameters characterizing the gas-density profile and the laser focal position. Three distinct profiles, with total lengths ranging from 200 to 400 micrometers and combining ramps and plateaus, were investigated. Optimal configurations were found to produce electron beams with median energies ranging from 14 to 17 MeV and charges of 600 to 1300 pC, considering electrons with energies above 8 MeV. Preliminary estimates of the molybdenum-99 yields for the optimal beams were obtained by employing their phase spaces, retrieved from PIC simulations, as radiation source inputs in Monte Carlo simulations irradiating a combined tantalum and molybdenum target.</description>

      <title>cDVAE: Multimodal Generative Conditional Diffusion Guided by Variational Autoencoder Latent Embedding for Virtual 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>

      <title>{\mu}TRISTAN and LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC Based Antimuon-Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of {\mu^+}{e^-} and {\mu^+}{\mu^+} colliders, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar {\mu^+} ring tangential to LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC will give an opportunity to realize {\mu^+}p and {\mu^+}A collisions at multi-TeV scale center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration: L exceeds {10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}p colliders and {10^{30} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}A colliders. Certainly, proposed colliders will provide huge potential for both SM (especially QCD basics) and BSM physics searches.</description>
