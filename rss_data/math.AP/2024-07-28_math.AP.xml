      <title>Inverse boundary value problem for the Convection-Diffusion equation with local data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a local data inverse problem for the time-dependent Convection-Diffusion Equation (CDE) in a bounded domain where a part of the boundary is treated to be inaccessible. Up on assuming the inaccessible part to be flat, we seek for the unique determination of the time-dependent convection and the density terms from the knowledge of the boundary data measured outside the inaccessible part. In the process, we show that there is a natural gauge in the perturbations, and we prove that this is the only obstruction in the uniqueness result.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-infinity stability and mean field limit of discrete interaction energy minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a quantitative stability result for the discrete interaction energy on the multi-dimensional torus, for the periodic Riesz potential. It states that if the number of particles $N$ is large and the discrete interaction energy is low, then the particle distribution is necessarily close to the uniform distribution (i.e., the continuous energy minimizer) in the Wasserstein-infinity distance. As a consequence, we obtain a quantitative mean field limit of interaction energy minimizers in the Wasserstein-infinity distance. The proof is based on the application of the author's previous joint work with J. Wang on the stability of continuous energy minimizer, together with a new mollification trick for the empirical measure in the case of singular interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>The kernel space of linear operator on a class of Grushin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kernel of linear operator on a class of Grushin equation. We shall use the spherical coordinate systems and the separation of variables to deal with this problem. We obtain that the kernel space of the linear operator related to our problem is precisely a linear subspace spanned by a finite-dimensional space, which is crucial in the process of constructing solutions by applying Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction argument.</description>

      <title>A note on the regularity and the existence of Riemannian splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive proof concerning the regularity of critical points for the spline energy functional on Riemannian manifolds, even for the general higher-order case. Although this result is widely acknowledged in the literature, a detailed proof was previously absent. Our proof relies on a generalization of the DuBois-Reymond Lemma. Furthermore, we establish the existence of minimizers for the spline energy functional in cases where multiple interpolation points are prescribed alongside just one velocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove sharp $L^\infty$ decay and modified scattering for the Hartree nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in dimensions $2$ and $3$ using the testing by wavepackets method of Ifrim and Tataru. We show that the scattering behavior happens at a regularity well below that of earlier results of Hayashi-Naumkin and Kato-Pusateri.</description>

      <title>Fujita phenomena in nonlinear fractional Rayleigh-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Cauchy problems for the nonlinear Rayleigh-Stokes equation and the corresponding system with time-fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which can be used to simulate the anomalous diffusion in viscoelastic fluids. It is shown that there exists the critical Fujita exponent which separates systematic blow-up of the solutions from possible global existence, and the critical exponent is independent of the parameter $\alpha$. Different from the general scaling argument for parabolic problems, the main ingredients of our proof are suitable decay estimates of the solution operator and the construction of the test function.</description>

      <title>Weak solution to KWC systems of pseudo-parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a class of systems of pseudo-parabolic PDEs is considered. These systems (S)$_\varepsilon$ are derived as a pseudo-parabolic dissipation system of Kobayashi--Warren--Carter energy, proposed by [Kobayashi et al., Physica D, 140, 141--150 (2000)], to describe planar grain boundary motion. These systems have been studied in [arXiv:2402.10413], and solvability, uniqueness and strong regularity of the solution have been reported under the setting that the initial data is sufficiently smooth. Meanwhile, in this paper, we impose weaker regularity on the initial data, and work on the weak formulation of the systems. In this light, we set our goal of this paper to prove two Main Theorems, concerned with: the existence and the uniqueness of weak solution to (S)$_\varepsilon$, and the continuous dependence with respect to the index $\varepsilon$, initial data and forcings.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the initial value problem for a fourth-order nonlinear dispersive system on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial value problem for a system of one-dimensional fourth-order dispersive partial differential-integral equations with nonlinearity involving derivatives up to second order. Examples of the system arise in relation with nonlinear science and geometric analysis. Applying the energy method based on the idea of a gauge transformation and Bona-Smith approximation technique, we prove that the initial value problem is time-locally well-posed on the real line for initial data in a Sobolev space with high regularity.</description>

      <title>Singularity formation of hydromagnetic waves in cold plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $C^1$ blow-up of the compressible fluid model introduced by Gardner and Morikawa, which describes the dynamics of a magnetized cold plasma. We propose sufficient conditions that lead to $C^1$ blow-up. In particular, we find that smooth solutions can break down in finite time even if the gradient of initial velocity is identically zero. The density and the gradient of the velocity become unbounded as time approaches the lifespan of the smooth solution. The Lagrangian formulation reduces the singularity formation problem to finding a zero of the associated second-order ODE.</description>

      <title>On the Nirenberg problem on spheres: Arbitrarily many solutions in a perturbative setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth positive function $K$ on the standard sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n,g_0)$, we use Morse theoretical methods and counting index formulae to prove that, under generic conditions on the function $K$, there are arbitrarily many metrics $g$ conformally equivalent to $g_0$ and whose scalar curvature is given by the function $K$ provided that the function is sufficiently close to the scalar curvature of $g_0$. Our approach leverages a comprehensive characterization of blowing-up solutions of a subcritical approximation, along with various Morse relations involving their indices. Notably, this multiplicity result is achieved without relying on any symmetry or periodicity assumptions about the function $K$.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of a two-stage structured diffusive population model in time-periodic and spatially heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the global dynamics of classical solutions of a two-stage (juvenile-adult) reaction-diffusion population model in time-periodic and spatially heterogeneous environments. It is shown that the sign of the principal eigenvalue $\lambda_*$ of the time-periodic linearized system at the trivial solution completely determines the persistence of the species. Moreover, when $\lambda_*&gt;0$, there is at least one time-periodic positive entire solution. A fairly general sufficient condition ensuring the uniqueness and global stability of the positive time-periodic solution is obtained. In particular, classical solutions eventually stabilize at the unique time-periodic positive solutions if either each subgroup's intra-stage growth and inter-stage competition rates are proportional, or the environment is temporally homogeneous and both subgroups diffuse slowly. In the later scenario, the asymptotic profile of steady states with respect to small diffusion rates is established.</description>

      <title>On reduced inertial PDE models for Cucker-Smale flocking dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle systems, flocking refers to the phenomenon where particles' individual velocities eventually align. The Cucker-Smale model is a well-known mathematical framework that describes this behavior. Many continuous descriptions of the Cucker-Smale model use PDEs with both particle position and velocity as independent variables, thus providing a full description of the particles mean-field limit (MFL) dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel reduced inertial PDE model consisting of two equations that depend solely on particle position. In contrast to other reduced models, ours is not derived from the MFL, but directly includes the model reduction at the level of the empirical densities, thus allowing for a straightforward connection to the underlying particle dynamics. We present a thorough analytical investigation of our reduced model, showing that: firstly, our reduced PDE satisfies a natural and interpretable continuous definition of flocking; secondly, in specific cases, we can fully quantify the discrepancy between PDE solution and particle system. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Existence of traveling breather solutions to cubic nonlinear Maxwell equations in waveguide geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the full set of Maxwell equations in a slab or cylindrical waveguide with a cubically nonlinear material law for the polarization of the electric field. The nonlinear polarization may be instantaneous or retarded, and we assume it to be confined inside the core of the waveguide. We prove existence of infinitely many spatially localized, real-valued and time-periodic solutions (breathers) propagating inside the waveguide by applying a variational minimization method to the resulting scalar quasilinear elliptic-hyperbolic equation for the profile of the breathers. The temporal period of the breathers has to be carefully chosen depending on the linear properties of the waveguide. As an example, our results apply if a two-layered linear axisymmetric waveguide is enhanced by a third core region with low refractive index where also the nonlinearity is located. In this case we can also connect our existence result with a bifurcation result. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. Our solutions are polychromatic functions in general, but for some special models of retarded nonlinear material laws, also monochromatic solutions can exist. In this case the numerical simulations raise an interesting open question: are the breather solutions with minimal energy monochromatic or polychromatic?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a boundary case of the classical prescribed curvature problem. We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and the boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes previous studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are close to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz introduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal metric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants</description>

      <title>Hearing the shape of a drum by knocking around</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variation of Kac's question, "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" if we allow ourselves access to some additional information. In particular, we allow ourselves to ``hear" the local Weyl counting function at each point on the manifold and ask if this is enough to uniquely recover the Riemannian metric. This is physically equivalent to asking whether one can determine the shape of a drum if one is allowed to knock at any place on the drum. We show that the answer to this question is ``yes" provided the Laplace-Beltrami spectrum of the drum is simple. We also provide a counterexample illustrating why this hypothesis is necessary.</description>

      <title>Time discretization in visco-elastodynamics at large displacements and strains in the Eulerian frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fully-implicit time discretization (i.e. the backward Euler formula) is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e. in the actual deforming configuration. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology are considered. Both a linearized convective model at large displacements with a convex stored energy and the fully nonlinear large strain variant with a (possibly generalized) polyconvex stored energy are considered. The time-discrete suitably regularized schemes are devised for both cases. The numerical stability and, considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, also convergence towards weak solutions are proved, exploiting the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity. In the fully nonlinear case, the examples of neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin materials are presented. A comparison with models of viscoelastic barotropic fluids is also made.</description>

      <title>A note on geometric assumptions for unique continuation from the edge of a crack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper aims at representing an improvement of the result in [2], where a strong unique continuation property and a description of the local behaviour around the edge of a crack for solutions to an elliptic problem are established, by relaxing the star-shapedness condition on the complement of the crack. More specifically, this assumption will be dropped off by applying a suitable diffeomorphism which straightens the boundary of the crack, before performing the approximation procedure developed in [2] in order to derive a suitable monotonicity formula. This will yield the appearence of a matrix in the equation, which shall be handled appropriately: for this we will take a hint from [4].</description>

      <title>On homogeneous Newton-Sobolev spaces of functions in metric measure spaces of uniformly locally controlled geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale behavior of Newton-Sobolev functions on complete, connected, proper, separable metric measure spaces equipped with a Borel measure $\mu$ with $\mu(X) = \infty$ and $0 &lt; \mu(B(x, r)) &lt; \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r \in (0, \infty)$ Our objective is to understand the relationship between the Dirichlet space $D^{1,p}(X)$, defined using upper gradients, and the Newton-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$, for $1\le p&lt;\infty$. We show that when $X$ is of uniformly locally $p$-controlled geometry, these two spaces do not coincide under a wide variety of geometric and potential theoretic conditions. We also show that when the metric measure space is the standard hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ with $n\ge 2$, these two spaces coincide precisely when $1\le p\le n-1$. We also provide additional characterizations of when a function in $D^{1,p}(X)$ is in $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$ in the case that the two spaces do not coincide.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in a kinetic mean-field game model of inertial self-propelled agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The framework of Mean-field Games (MFGs) is used for modelling the collective dynamics of large populations of non-cooperative decision-making agents. We formulate and analyze a kinetic MFG model for an interacting system of non-cooperative motile agents with inertial dynamics and finite-range interactions, where each agent is minimizing a biologically inspired cost function. By analyzing the associated coupled forward-backward in time system of nonlinear Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, we obtain conditions for closed-loop linear stability of the spatially homogeneous MFG equilibrium that corresponds to an ordered state with non-zero mean speed. Using a combination of analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when energetic cost of control is reduced below a critical value, this equilibrium loses stability, and the system transitions to a travelling wave solution. Our work provides a game-theoretic perspective to the problem of collective motion in non-equilibrium biological and bio-inspired systems.</description>

      <title>Ancient and expanding spin ALE Ricci flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify spin ALE ancient Ricci flows and spin ALE expanding solitons with suitable groups at infinity. In particular, the only spin ancient Ricci flows with groups at infinity in $SU(2)$ and mild decay at infinity are hyperk\"ahler ALE metrics. The main idea of the proof, of independent interest, consists in showing that the large-scale behavior of Perelman's $\mu$-functional on any ALE orbifold with non-negative scalar curvature is controlled by a renormalized $\lambda_{\mathrm{ALE}}$-functional related to a notion of weighted mass.</description>

      <title>On the Support of Anomalous Dissipation Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of a unifying measure-theoretic approach, we establish lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the space-time set which can support anomalous dissipation for weak solutions of fluid equations, both in the presence or absence of a physical boundary. Boundary dissipation, which can occur at both the time and the spatial boundary, is analyzed by suitably modifying the Duchon &amp; Robert interior distributional approach. One implication of our results is that any bounded Euler solution (compressible or incompressible) arising as a zero viscosity limit of Navier-Stokes solutions cannot have anomalous dissipation supported on a set of dimension smaller than that of the space. This result is sharp, as demonstrated by entropy-producing shock solutions of compressible Euler and by recent constructions of dissipative incompressible Euler solutions, as well as passive scalars. For $L^q_tL^r_x$ suitable Leray-Hopf solutions of the $d-$dimensional Navier-Stokes equation we prove a bound of the dissipation in terms of the Parabolic Hausdorff measure soon as the solution lies in the Prodi-Serrin class. In the three-dimensional case, this matches with the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg partial regularity.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Riemannian manifolds with ${\sf Ric}\geq 0$ via Optimal Transport theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Cordero-Erausquin, Nazaret and Villani [Adv. Math., 2004] proved sharp Sobolev inequalities in Euclidean spaces via Optimal Mass Transportation, raising the question whether their approach is powerful enough to produce sharp Sobolev inequalities also on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper we affirmatively answer their question for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature; namely, by using Optimal Mass Transportation with quadratic distance cost, sharp $L^p$-Sobolev and $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (both for $p&gt;1$ and $p=1$) are established, where the optimal constants contain the asymptotic volume growth arising from precise asymptotic properties of the Talentian and Gaussian bubbles. As a byproduct, we give an alternative, elementary proof to the main result of do Carmo and Xia [Compos. Math., 2004] (and subsequent results) concerning the quantitative volume non-collapsing estimates on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature that support certain Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of a generalized thermoelastic system (the so called $\alpha-\beta$ system) with delay in a part of the coupled system. For each case, we prove the well-posedness of the corresponding system using semigroup approach, then under some sufficient conditions we establish some results of exponential and polynomial stability of the system through a frequency-domain approach. The results are applied to concrete examples in thermoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity and optimal control for a non-local Cahn-Hilliard tumour growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-local tumour growth model of phase-field type, describing the evolution of tumour cells through proliferation in presence of a nutrient. The model consists of a coupled system, incorporating a non-local Cahn-Hilliard equation for the tumour phase variable and a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient. First, we establish novel regularity results for such a model, by applying maximal regularity theory in weighted $L^p$ spaces. This technique enables us to prove the local existence and uniqueness of a regular solution, including also chemotaxis effects. By leveraging time-regularisation properties and global boundedness estimates, we further extend the solution to a global one. These results provide the foundation for addressing an optimal distributed control problem, aimed at identifying a suitable therapy guiding the tumour towards a predefined target. Specifically, we prove the existence of an optimal therapy and, by studying the Fr\'echet-differentiability of the control-to-state operator and introducing the adjoint system, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Phase Transition Problems with Evolving Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the mathematical analysis and homogenization of a moving boundary problem posed for a highly heterogeneous, periodically perforated domain. More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but $\varespilon$-independent time interval ($\varespilon$ is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we discover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct byproduct of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective precomputing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.</description>

      <title>Classical solutions to the soap film capillarity problem for plane boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the soap film capillarity problem, in which soap films are modeled as sets of least perimeter among those having prescribed (small) volume and satisfying a topological spanning condition. When the given boundary is the closed tubular neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of a smooth Jordan curve (or, more generally, the closed tubular neighborhood in $\mathbb{R}^d$ of a smooth embedding of $\mathbb{S}^{d-2}$ in a hyperplane), we prove existence and uniqueness of classical minimizers, for which the collapsing phenomenon does not occur. We show that the boundary of the unique minimizer is the union of two symmetric smooth normal graphs over a portion of the plane; the graphs have positive constant mean curvature bounded linearly in terms of the volume parameter, and meet the boundary of the tubular neighbourhood orthogonally. Moreover, we prove uniform bounds on the sectional curvatures in order to show that the boundaries of solutions corresponding to varying volumes are ordered monotonically and produce a foliation of space by constant mean curvature hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Constrained and unconstrained stable discrete minimizations for p-robust local reconstructions in vertex patches in the de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze constrained and unconstrained minimization problems on patches of tetrahedra sharing a common vertex with discontinuous piecewise polynomial data of degree p. We show that the discrete minimizers in the spaces of piecewise polynomials of degree p conforming in the H1, H(curl), or H(div) spaces are as good as the minimizers in these entire (infinite-dimensional) Sobolev spaces, up to a constant that is independent of p. These results are useful in the analysis and design of finite element methods, namely for devising stable local commuting projectors and establishing local-best/global-best equivalences in a priori analysis and in the context of a posteriori error estimation. Unconstrained minimization in H1 and constrained minimization in H(div) have been previously treated in the literature. Along with improvement of the results in the H1 and H(div) cases, our key contribution is the treatment of the H(curl) framework. This enables us to cover the whole De Rham diagram in three space dimensions in a single setting.</description>

      <title>Regularization by rough Kraichnan noise for the generalised SQG equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generalised Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (gSQG) equations in $\mathbb R^2$ with parameter $\beta\in (0,1)$, an active scalar model interpolating between SQG ($\beta=1$) and the 2D Euler equations ($\beta=0$) in vorticity form. Existence of weak $(L^1\cap L^p)$-valued solutions in the deterministic setting is known, but their uniqueness is open. We show that the addition of a rough Stratonovich transport noise of Kraichnan type regularizes the PDE, providing strong existence and pathwise uniqueness of solutions for initial data $\theta_0\in L^1\cap L^p$, for suitable values $p\in[2,\infty]$ related to the regularity degree $\alpha$ of the noise and the singularity degree $\beta$ of the velocity field; in particular, we can cover any $\beta\in (0,1)$ for suitable $\alpha$ and $p$ and we can reach a suitable ("critical") threshold. The result also holds in the presence of external forcing $f\in L^1_t (L^1\cap L^p)$ and solutions are shown to depend continuously on the data of the problem; furthermore, they are well approximated by vanishing viscosity and regular approximations.</description>
