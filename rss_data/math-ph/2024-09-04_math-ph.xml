      <title>2D attractive almost-bosonic anyon gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional space, we consider a system of $N$ anyons interacts via a short range attractive two-body interaction. In the stable regime, we derive the average-field Pauli functional as the mean-field limit of many-body quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we investigate the collapse phenomenon in the collapse regime where the strength of attractions tends to a critical value (defined by the cubic NLS equation) while simultaneously considering the weak field regime where the strength of the self-generated magnetic field tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. II: Dispersive phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Eliashberg theory of superconductivity is studied. The effective electron-electron interactions are mediated by dispersive phonons, with Eliashberg spectral function $\alpha^2 F(\omega)\geq 0$ that is $\propto\omega^2$ for small $\omega&gt;0$ and vanishes for large $\omega$. The Eliashberg function also defines the electron-phonon coupling strength $\lambda:= 2 \int_0^\infty\frac{\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}d\omega$. Setting $\frac{2\alpha^2 F(\omega)}{\omega}=: \lambda P^\prime(\omega)$, with $P^\prime(\omega)$ the density of a probability measure $P(d\omega)$ supported in $[0,\overline{\Omega}(P)]$ with $0&lt; \overline{\Omega}(P)$, and assuming as usual that the phase transition between normal and superconductivity coincides with the linear stability boundary $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ of the normal region against perturbations toward the superconducting region, it is shown that $\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$ is a graph of a function $\Lambda(P,T)$ that is determined by a variational principle: if $(\lambda,P,T)\in\mathscr{S}_{\!c}$, then $\lambda = 1/\mathfrak{k}(P,T)$, where $\mathfrak{k}(P,T)&gt;0$ is the largest eigenvalue of a compact self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{K}(P,T)$ on $\ell^2$ sequences. Given $P$, sufficient conditions on $T$ are stated under which the map $T\mapsto \lambda = \Lambda(P,T)$ is invertible. For sufficiently large $\lambda$ this yields: (i) the existence of a critical temperature $T_c$ as function of $\lambda$ and $P$; (ii) a sequence of lower bounds on $T_c(\lambda,P)$ that converges to $T_c(\lambda,P)$. Also obtained is an upper bound on $T_c(\lambda,P)$. It agrees with the asymptotic form $T_c(\lambda,P) \sim C \sqrt{\langle \omega^2\rangle} \sqrt{\lambda}$ valid for $\lambda\sim\infty$, given $P$, though with $C\approx 2.034 C_\infty$ where $C_\infty = 0.1827262477...$ is the sharp constant. Here, $\langle\omega^2\rangle := \int_0^\infty \omega^2 P(d\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $T_c$ in the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity. I: The $\gamma$-model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recent reformulation for the Eliashberg theory of superconductivity in terms of a classical interacting Bloch spin chain model, rigorous upper and lower bounds on the critical temperature $T_c$ are obtained for the $\gamma$ model -- a version of Eliashberg theory in which the effective electron-electron interaction is proportional to $(g/|\omega_n-\omega_m|)^{\gamma}$, where $\omega_n-\omega_m$ is the transferred Matsubara frequency, $g&gt;0$ a reference energy, and $\gamma&gt;0$ a parameter. The rigorous lower bounds are based on a variational principle that identifies $(T_c/g)^\gamma$ with the largest (positive) eigenvalue of an explicitly constructed compact, self-adjoint operator $\mathfrak{G}(\gamma)$. These lower bounds form an increasing sequence that converges to $T_c(g,\gamma)$. The upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$ is based on fixed point theory, proving linear stability of the normal state for $T$ larger than the upper bound on $T_c(g,\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inter-relations in random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ensemble inter-relations to be considered are special features of classical cases, where the joint eigenvalue probability density can be computed explicitly. Attention will be focussed too on the consequences of these inter-relations, most often in relation to gap probabilities. A highlight from this viewpoint is an evaluation formula for the gap probability generating function for the circular orthogonal and circular symplectic ensembles (examples of Pfaffian point processes), in terms of the gap probability generating function for real orthogonal matrices chosen with Haar measure ensembles (examples of determinantal point processes). The classes of inter-relations which lead to this result involve the superposition of the eigenvalue point processes of two independent classical ensembles, or consideration of the singular values of the classical ensembles with an evenness symmetry, and the decimation operation of integrating over every second eigenvalue. It turns out that the probability density functions encountered through the consideration of superposition and decimation can in some cases be obtained via the consideration of various rank one matrix perturbations. These allow for different understandings of some of the inter-relations in this class. We make note too of inter-relations -- which we consider generally as an identity or evaluation formula of a statistic linking two distinct random matrix ensemble -- that fall outside of this class, applying to the spectral form factor, and ones relating to discrete determinantal point processes. Not part of our review are the so-called duality relations of random matrix theory. Their consideration warrants a separate discussion.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry protected states of quantum spin chains for continuous symmetry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry protected states (SPT's) of quantum spin systems were studied by several authors. For one-dimensional systems (spin chains), there is an essentially complete and rigorous understanding: SPT's corresponding to finite on-site symmetry groups $G$ are classified by the second cohomology group $H^2(G,U(1))$, as established by Kapustin et al. [J. Math. Phys. (2021)]. We extend this result to the case of compact topological symmetry groups $G$. We also strengthen the existing results in the sense that our classification results holds within the class of spin chains with locally bounded on-site dimensions.</description>

      <title>Error exponents for entanglement transformations from degenerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the trade-off relation between the rate and the strong converse exponent for asymptotic LOCC transformations between pure multipartite states. Any single-copy probabilistic transformation between a pair of states implies that an asymptotic transformation at rate 1 is possible with an exponentially decreasing success probability. However, it is possible that an asymptotic transformation is feasible with nonzero probability, but there is no transformation between any finite number of copies with the same rate, even probabilistically. In such cases it is not known if the optimal success probability decreases exponentially or faster. A fundamental tool for showing the feasibility of an asymptotic transformation is degeneration. Any degeneration gives rise to a sequence of stochastic LOCC transformations from copies of the initial state plus a sublinear number of GHZ states to the same number of copies of the target state. These protocols involve parameters that can be freely chosen, but the choice affects the success probability. In this paper, we characterize an asymptotically optimal choice of the parameters and derive a single-letter expression for the error exponent of the resulting protocol. In particular, this implies an exponential lower bound on the success probability when the stochastic transformation arises from a degeneration.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the shifted Coulomb Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp Lieb-Thirring (LT) inequalities for the family of shifted Coulomb Hamiltonians. More precisely, we prove the classical LT inequalities with the semi-classical constant for this family of operators in any dimension $d\geqslant 3$ and any $\gamma \geqslant 1$. We also prove that the semi-classical constant is never optimal for the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum (CLR) inequalities for this family of operators in any dimension. In this case, we characterize the optimal constant as the minimum of a finite set and provide an asymptotic expansion as the dimension grows. Using the same method to prove the CLR inequalities for Coulomb, we obtain more information about the conjectured optimal constant in the CLR inequality for arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms, which in turn describe an abstract surface with a Gaussian curvature equal to $-1$. In our investigation, we identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve the set of solutions and establish conserved quantities. Through the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that explicitly provide metrics for the described surfaces. These solutions, however, exhibit an unbounded nature; notably, some appear in pairs that display a sort of "mirror symmetry" with respect to their bounded regions. To address this, we utilize both the conserved quantities and this symmetry to develop a process, which we term the "collage" method. This method effectively removes the unbounded parts from these pairs of solutions and seamlessly glues them together in a smooth manner. Consequently, this process results in weak solutions that remain consistent with the conserved quantities identified. The solutions produced through the collage process are pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than the peakon solutions of Camassa-Holm type equations. Moreover, we apply a Miura-type transformation that connects our original equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation. This transformation allows us to map the solutions from our initial equation to those of the Degasperis-Procesi equation. As a result, we uncover previously unnoticed phenomena, such as a solution to the Degasperis-Procesi equation that exhibits a novel combination of peakon and shock-peakon features, which appears to be unreported to date.</description>

      <title>Moments of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives for $SO(2N)$ and $USp(2N)$ and their application to one-level density in families of elliptic curve $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the ratios theorems, we calculate the leading order terms in $N$ for the following averages of the characteristic polynomial and its derivative: $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{SO(2N)}$ and $\left&lt; \left|\Lambda_A(1 )\right| ^{r} \frac{ \Lambda_A'(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi}) }{ \Lambda_A(\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \phi})} \right&gt;_{USp(2N)}$. Our expression, derived for integer $r$, permits analytic continuation in $r$ and we conjecture that this agrees with the above averages for non-integer exponents. We use this result to obtain an expression for the one level density of the `excised ensemble', a subensemble of $SO(2N)$, to next-to-leading order in $N$. We then present the analogous calculation for the one level density of quadratic twists of elliptic curve $L$-functions, taking into account a number theoretical bound on the central values of the $L$-functions. The method we use to calculate the above random matrix averages uses the contour integral form of the ratios theorems, which are a key tool in the growing literature on averages of characteristic polynomials and their derivatives, and as we evaluate the next-to-leading term for large matrix size $N$, this leads to some multi-dimensional contour integrals that are slightly asymmetric in the integration variables, which might be useful in other work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Schr\"odinger operator on bounded, convex domains with mixed boundary conditions, where a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on a part of the boundary and a Neumann boundary condition on its complement. We prove inequalities between the lowest eigenvalues corresponding to two different choices of such boundary conditions on both planar and higher-dimensional domains. We also prove an inequality between higher order mixed eigenvalues and pure Dirichlet eigenvalues on multidimensional polyhedral domains.</description>

      <title>Difference Equations: from Berry Connections to the Coulomb Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated that a spectral variety for the Berry connection of a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSM with K\"ahler vacuum moduli space $X$ and abelian flavour symmetry is the support of a sheaf induced by a certain action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$. This action could be quantised to first-order matrix difference equations obeyed by brane amplitudes, and by taking the conformal limit, vortex partition functions. In this article, we elucidate how some of these results may be recovered from a 3d perspective, by placing the 2d theory at a boundary and gauging the flavour symmetry via a bulk A-twisted 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory (a sandwich construction). We interpret the above action as that of the bulk Coulomb branch algebra on boundary twisted chiral operators. This relates our work to recent constructions of actions of Coulomb branch algebras on quantum equivariant cohomology, providing a novel correspondence between these actions and spectral data of generalised periodic monopoles. The effective IR description of the 2d theory in terms of a twisted superpotential allows for explicit computations of these actions, which we demonstrate for abelian GLSMs.</description>

      <title>Current Algebra and Generalised Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor. As an application, we use this framework to phrase sigma model dynamics in an explicitly covariant way -- both under generalised diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Classical variational phase-field models cannot predict fracture nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Notwithstanding the evidence against them, classical variational phase-field models continue to be used and pursued in an attempt to describe fracture nucleation in elastic brittle materials. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing evidence against such a class of models as descriptors of fracture nucleation. To that end, a review is first given of the plethora of experimental observations of fracture nucleation in nominally elastic brittle materials under quasi-static loading conditions, as well as of classical variational phase-field models, without and with energy splits. These models are then confronted with the experimental observations. The conclusion is that they cannot possibly describe fracture nucleation in general. This because classical variational phase-field models cannot account for material strength as an independent macroscopic material property. The last part of the paper includes a brief summary of a class of phase-field models that can describe fracture nucleation. It also provides a discussion of how pervasively material strength has been overlooked in the analysis of fracture at large, as well as an outlook into the modeling of fracture nucleation beyond the basic setting of elastic brittle materials.</description>

      <title>A reduction theorem for good basic invariants of finite complex reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our previous article arXiv:2307.07897. We describe a certain reduction process of Satake's good basic invariants. We show that if the largest degree $d_1$ of a finite complex reflection group $G$ is regular and if $\delta$ is a divisor of $d_1$, a set of good basic invariants of $G$ induces that of the reflection subquotient $G_{\delta}$. We also show that the potential vector field of a duality group $G$, which gives the multiplication constants of the natural Saito structure on the orbit space, induces that of $G_{\delta}$. Several examples of this reduction process are also presented.</description>

      <title>Casting more light in the shadows: dual Somos-5 sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for an appropriate notion of a cluster superalgebra, incorporating Grassmann variables, Ovsienko and Tabachnikov considered the extension of various recurrence relations with the Laurent phenomenon to the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, by iterating recurrences with specific numerical values, some particular well-known integer sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence, Markoff numbers, and Somos sequences, were shown to produce associated ``shadow'' sequences when they were extended to the dual numbers. Here we consider the most general version of the Somos-5 recurrence defined over the ring of dual numbers $\mathbb{D}$ with complex coefficients, that is the ring $\mathbb{C}[\varepsilon]$ modulo the relation $\varepsilon^2=0$. We present three different ways to present the general solution of the initial value problem for Somos-5 and its shadow part: in analytic form, using the Weierstrass sigma function with arguments in $\mathbb{D}$; in terms of the solution of a linear difference equation; and using Hankel determinants constructed from $\mathbb{D}$-valued moments, via a connection with a Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) map over the dual numbers.</description>

      <title>Universal bound on the relaxation rates for quantum Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation rates provide important characteristics both for classical and quantum processes. Essentially they control how fast the system thermalizes, equilibrates, {decoheres, and/or dissipates}. Moreover, very often they are directly accessible to be measured in the laboratory and hence they define key physical properties of the system. Experimentally measured relaxation rates can be used to test validity of a particular theoretical model. Here we analyze a fundamental question: {\em does quantum mechanics provide any nontrivial constraint for relaxation rates?} We prove the conjecture formulated a few years ago that any quantum channel implies that a maximal rate is bounded from above by the sum of all the relaxation rates divided by the dimension of the Hilbert space. It should be stressed that this constraint is universal (it is valid for all quantum systems with finite number of energy levels) and it is tight (cannot be improved). In addition, the constraint plays an analogous role to the seminal Bell inequalities and the well known Leggett-Garg inequalities (sometimes called temporal Bell inequalities). Violations of Bell inequalities rule out local hidden variable models, and violations of Leggett-Garg inequalities rule out macrorealism. Similarly, violations of the bound rule out completely positive-divisible evolution.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear two-dimensional water waves with arbitrary vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional water-wave problem with a general non-zero vorticity field in a fluid volume with a flat bed and a free surface. The nonlinear equations of motion for the chosen surface and volume variables are expressed with the aid of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator and the Green function of the Laplace operator in the fluid domain. Moreover, we provide new explicit expressions for both objects.
  The field of a point vortex and its interaction with the free surface is studied as an example. In the small-amplitude long-wave Boussinesq and KdV regimes, we obtain appropriate systems of coupled equations for the dynamics of the point vortex and the time evolution of the free surface variables.</description>

Abstract: We consider the second class particle in half-line open TASEP under two different initial conditions with shock discontinuities. The exact formulas for the distribution of the second class particle can be derived by using the color-position symmetry theorem of colored half-space TASEP. We study the asymptotic distribution of second class particles under the constant scaling and KPZ-type scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stationary measure of the open asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with light particles. We prove several results on the asymptotic locations of the light particles under the stationary measure. Moreover, in the fan region of the high and low density phases, we study the mixing times for open ASEP with light particles. Our approach involves the matrix product ansatz, Askey-Wilson signed measures, moderate deviation results for second class particles, as well as various coupling arguments. Along the way we obtain the particle densities at single sites for the standard open ASEP without light particles, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the classical and nonlocal semi-discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (sdNLS) equations with nonzero backgrounds are solved by means of the bilinearization-reduction approach. In the first step of this approach, the unreduced sdNLS system with a nonzero background is bilinearized and its solutions are presented in terms of quasi double Casoratians. Then, reduction techniques are implemented to deal with complex and nonlocal reductions, which yields solutions for the four classical and nonlocal sdNLS equations with a plane wave background or a hyperbolic function background. These solutions are expressed with explicit formulae and allow classifications according to canonical forms of certain spectral matrix. In particular, we present explicit formulae for general rogue waves for the classical focusing sdNLS equation. Some obtained solutions are analyzed and illustrated.</description>

Abstract: Holomorphic modular bootstrap is an approach to classifying rational conformal field theories making use of the modular differential equations. In this paper we explore its flavored refinement. For a class of chiral algebras, we propose constraints on a special null state, which determine the structure of the algebra, and through flavored modular differential equations and quasi-modularity, completely fix the spectra in both the untwisted and twisted sector. Using the differential equations, we reveal hidden structures among null states of the chiral algebras under the modular group action and translation related to spectral flow.</description>

      <title>Two-stage initial-value iterative physics-informed neural networks for simulating solitary waves of nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new two-stage initial-value iterative neural network (IINN) algorithm for solitary wave computations of nonlinear wave equations based on traditional numerical iterative methods and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Specifically, the IINN framework consists of two subnetworks, one of which is used to fit a given initial value, and the other incorporates physical information and continues training on the basis of the first subnetwork. Importantly, the IINN method does not require any additional data information including boundary conditions, apart from the given initial value. Corresponding theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our IINN method. The proposed IINN method is efficiently applied to learn some types of solutions in different nonlinear wave equations, including the one-dimensional (1D) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) equation (with and without potentials), the 1D saturable NLS equation with PT -symmetric optical lattices, the 1D focusing-defocusing coupled NLS equations, the KdV equation, the two-dimensional (2D) NLS equation with potentials, the 2D amended GP equation with a potential, the (2+1)-dimensional KP equation, and the 3D NLS equation with a potential. These applications serve as evidence for the efficacy of our method. Finally, by comparing with the traditional methods, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed IINN method.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: causal propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the causal (forward/backward) propagators for the massive Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by a first order operator which decays in space but not necessarily in time. In particular, we obtain global estimates for forward/backward solutions to the inhomogeneous, perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, including in the presence of bound states of the limiting spatial Hamiltonians.
  To this end, we prove propagation of singularities estimates in all regions of infinity (spatial, null, and causal) and use the estimates to prove that the Klein-Gordon operator is an invertible mapping between adapted weighted Sobolev spaces. This builds off work of Vasy in which inverses of hyperbolic PDEs are obtained via construction of a Fredholm mapping problem using radial points propagation estimates. To deal with the presence of a perturbation which persists in time, we employ a class of pseudodifferential operators first explored in Vasy's many-body work.</description>

      <title>Suppression of soliton collapses, modulational instability, and rogue-wave excitation in two-L\'evy-index fractional Kerr media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: s in laser systems with two fractional-dispersion/diffraction terms, quantified by their L\'{e}vy indices, $\alpha_{1}\, \alpha_{2}\in (1, 2]$, and self-focusing or defocusing Kerr nonlinearity. Some fundamental solitons are obtained by means of the variational approximation, which are verified by comparison with numerical results. We find that the soliton collapse, exhibited by the one-dimensional cubic fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with only one L\'{e}vy index $\alpha =1$, can be suppressed in the two-L\'{e}vy-index fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system. Stability of the solitons is also explored against collisions with Gaussian pulses and adiabatic variation of the system parameters. Modulation instability of continuous waves is investigated in the two-L\'{e}vy-index system too. In particular, the modulation instability may occur in the case of the defocusing nonlinearity when two diffraction coefficients have opposite signs. Using results for the modulation instability, we produce first- and second-order rogue waves on top of continuous waves, for both signs of the Kerr nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of the Fisher information for the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Fisher information is monotone decreasing in time along solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation for a large class of collision kernels covering all classical interactions derived from systems of particles. For general collision kernels, a sufficient condition for the monotonicity of the Fisher information along the flow is related to the best constant for an integro-differential inequality for functions on the sphere, which belongs in the family of the Log-Sobolev inequalities. As a consequence, we establish the existence of global smooth solutions to the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation in the main situation of interest where this was not known, namely the regime of very soft potentials. This is opening the path to the completion of both the classical program of qualitative study of space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation, initiated by Carleman, and the program of using the Fisher information in the study of the Boltzmann equation, initiated by McKean. From the proofs and discussion emerges a strengthened picture of the links between kinetic theory, information theory and log-Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An explicit Loop Tree Duality (LTD) formula for two-loop Feynman integrals with integer power of propagators is presented and used for a numerical UV divergence subtraction algorithm. This algorithm proceeds recursively and it is based on the $\mathcal{R}$ operator and the Hopf algebraic structure of UV divergences. After a short review of LTD and the numerical evaluation of multi-loop integrals, LTD is extended to two-loop integrals with generalized powers of propagators. The $\mathcal{R}$ operator and the tadpole UV subtraction are employed for the numerical calculation of two-loop UV divergent integrals, including the case of quadratic divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two tensor fields of type (1,1) on a smooth n-dimensional manifold M, such that all their Fr\"olicher-Nijenhuis brackets vanish, the algebra of differential forms on M becomes a bi-differential graded algebra. As a consequence, there are partial differential equation (PDE) systems associated with it, which arise as the integrability condition of a system of linear equations and possess a binary Darboux transformation to generate exact solutions. We recover chiral models and potential forms of the self-dual Yang-Mills, as well as corresponding generalizations to higher than four dimensions, and obtain new integrable non-autonomous nonlinear matrix PDEs and corresponding systems.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations for the boundary-driven zero-range process on graphs: microscopic versus macroscopic approach and a theory of non-reversible resistor-like networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph for a boundary-driven zero-range dynamics. This generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches \cite{BDGJL1,HRS}; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory \cite{MFT}, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models \cite{Cap}). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process \cite{L} and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks in \cite{B}.</description>

      <title>Mutual information from modular flow in CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators in the replica trick framework enables a long-distance expansion of the mutual information (MI) in conformal field theories (CFTs). In this expansion, the terms are labeled by primary operators, as contributions from descendant operators can be resummed into conformal blocks. However, for the MI, the expansion involves primaries from the multi-replica theory, which includes far more operators than those in the original theory. In this work, we develop a method to resum this series, yielding an expansion in terms of the primaries of the original theory, specifically restricted to the two-copy sector. This is achieved by expressing the twist operators in a non-local manner across different replicas and using a modular flow representation to obtain the n -&gt; 1 limit of the R\'enyi index. We explicitly compute the resulting "enhanced conformal blocks", which, surprisingly, provide excellent approximations to the MI of generalized free fields across the full range of cross ratios. Remarkably, this approximation appears to be exact in the limit of large spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01433v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</description>

      <title>The square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using exact enumeration, the Casimir amplitude and the Casimir force are calculated for the square lattice Ising model with quenched surface disorder on one surface in cylinder geometry at criticality. The system shape is characterized by the aspect ratio $\rho=L/M$, where the cylinder length $L$ can take arbitrary values, while the circumference $M$ is varied from $M=4$ to $M=54$, resulting in up to $2^{54}$ numerically exact free energy calculations. A careful $M\to\infty$ extrapolation shows that quenched surface disorder is irrelevant in two dimensions, but gives rise to logarithmic corrections.</description>

      <title>On Propagation of Information in Quantum Mechanics and Maximal Velocity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit key notions related to evolution of quantum information in quantum mechanics and prove uniform bounds on the maximal speed of propagation of quantum information for states and observables with exponential error bounds. Our results imply, in particular, a quantum mechanical version of the Lieb-Robinson bound, which is known to yield various constraints on propagation of quantum information. We propose a novel approach to proving maximal speed bounds.</description>

      <title>Classically estimating observables of noiseless quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a classical algorithm for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on most quantum circuits across all circuit architectures and depths, including those with all-to-all connectivity. We prove that for any architecture where each circuit layer is equipped with a measure invariant under single-qubit rotations, our algorithm achieves a small error $\varepsilon$ on all circuits except for a small fraction $\delta$. The computational time is polynomial in qubit count and circuit depth for any small constant $\varepsilon, \delta$, and quasi-polynomial for inverse-polynomially small $\varepsilon, \delta$. For non-classically-simulable input states or observables, the expectation values can be estimated by augmenting our algorithm with classical shadows of the relevant state or observable. Our approach leverages a Pauli-path method under Heisenberg evolution. While prior works are limited to noisy quantum circuits, we establish classical simulability in noiseless regimes. Given that most quantum circuits in an architecture exhibit chaotic and locally scrambling behavior, our work demonstrates that estimating observables of such quantum dynamics is classically tractable across all geometries.</description>

      <title>A Note On Projective Structures On Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projective structures on topological surfaces support the structure of 2d CFTs with a degree of technical simplification. Arguments for their existence are reviewed along with their essential properties. We propose a complex analytic manifold $\mathcal{P}_g$ biholomorphic to $T^*_{(1,0)} \mathcal{M}_g$ as a pseudo moduli space of the projective structures of the genus $g$ topological surface. Explicit computations at $g=1$ including the analysis of transformations under the modular group support this proposal, and show that $\mathcal{P}_{g=1}$ naturally resolves the orbifold locus of the affine structure moduli space. For $g \geq 2$, whether $\mathcal{P}_g$ contains redundancy at each value of the complex structure moduli remains open.
  Physically, the space $\mathcal{P}_g$ represents the bundle of universal, stationary, chiral hydrodynamic flows spatially confined to compact genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>A constitutive condition for idealized isotropic Cauchy elasticity involving the logarithmic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Hill and Leblond, the aim of our work is to show, for isotropic nonlinear elasticity, a relation between the corotational Zaremba-Jaumann objective derivative of the Cauchy stress $\sigma$, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma] = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}{t}}[\sigma] - W \, \sigma + \sigma \, W, \qquad W = {\rm skew}(\dot F \, F^{-1})
  \end{equation} and a constitutive requirement involving the logarithmic strain tensor. Given the deformation tensor $F ={\rm D} \varphi$, the left Cauchy-Green tensor $B = F \, F^T$, and the strain-rate tensor $D = {\rm sym}(\dot F \, F^{-1})$, we show that
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqCPSdef}
  \begin{alignedat}{2}
  \forall \,D\in{\rm Sym}(3) \! \setminus \! \{0\}:
  ~
  \langle{\frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma]},{D}\rangle &gt; 0
  \quad
  &amp;\iff
  \quad
  \log B
  \longmapsto
  \widehat\sigma(\log B)
  \;\textrm{is strongly Hilbert-monotone}
  &amp;\iff \quad {\rm sym} {\rm D}_{\log B} \widehat \sigma(\log B) \in{\rm Sym}^{++}_4(6) \quad \text{(TSTS-M$^{++}$)},
  \end{alignedat} \tag{1}
  \end{equation} where ${\rm Sym}^{++}_4(6)$ denotes the set of positive definite, (minor and major) symmetric fourth order tensors. We call the first inequality ``corotational stability postulate'' (CSP), a novel concept, which implies the \textbf{T}rue-\textbf{S}tress \textbf{T}rue-\textbf{S}train strict Hilbert-\textbf{M}onotonicity (TSTS-M$^+$) for $B \mapsto \sigma(B) = \widehat \sigma(\log B)$, i.e. \begin{equation}
  \langle \widehat\sigma(\log B_1)-\widehat\sigma(\log B_2),{\log B_1-\log B_2} \rangle&gt; 0
  \qquad
  \forall \, B_1\neq B_2\in{\rm Sym}^{++}(3) \, . \end{equation} In this paper we expand on the ideas of Hill and Leblond, extending Leblonds calculus to the Cauchy elastic case.</description>

      <title>Phase transition for the bottom singular vector of rectangular random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rectangular random matrix $X=(x_{ij})\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ whose entries are iid with tail $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$. We consider the regime $N(n)/n\to \mathsf{a}&gt;1$ as $n$ tends to infinity. Our main interest lies in the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value, which we will refer to as the "bottom singular vector", denoted by $\mathfrak{u}$. In this paper, we prove the following phase transition regarding the localization length of $\mathfrak{u}$: when $\alpha&lt;2$ the localization length is $O(n/\log n)$; when $\alpha&gt;2$ the localization length is of order $n$. Similar results hold for all right singular vectors around the smallest singular value. The variational definition of the bottom singular vector suggests that the mechanism for this localization-delocalization transition when $\alpha$ goes across $2$ is intrinsically different from the one for the top singular vector when $\alpha$ goes across $4$.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling and an iteration argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport on a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of a finite generation, or the Cayley tree, which may model the energy transport in a light-harvesting molecule. As a new feature to analyze the quantum transport, we add complex potentials for sources on the peripheral sites and for a drain on the central site. We find that the eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site are quite limited to the number of generation. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry the current, which reduces the problem to the quantum transport on a parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric tight-binding chain. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point for the zero-energy states, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the $PT$-symmetric complex potentials. As we introduce randomness in the number of links in each generation of the tree, the resulting linear chain is a random-hopping tight-binding model. We find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly but approximately for a zero-energy state, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Duality in various dimensions is understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. We rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic ``modulating'' translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nappi-Witten vertex operator algebra via inverse Quantum Hamiltonian Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA was initiated in arXiv:1104.3921 and arXiv:2011.14453. In this paper we use the technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$. We first prove that the quantum hamiltonian reduction of $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is the Heisenberg-Virasoro VOA $L^{HVir}$ of level zero investigated in arXiv:math/0201314 and arXiv:1405.1707. We invert the quantum hamiltonian reduction in this case and prove that $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is realized as a vertex subalgebra of $L^{HVir} \otimes \Pi$, where $\Pi$ is a certain lattice-like vertex algebra. Using such an approach we shall realize all relaxed highest weight modules which were classified in arXiv:2011.14453. We show that every relaxed highest weight module, whose top components is neither highest nor lowest weight $\mathfrak h_4$-module, has the form $M_1 \otimes \Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ where $M_1$ is an irreducible, highest weight $L^{HVir}$-module and $\Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ is an irreducible weight $\Pi$-module.
  Using the fusion rules for $L^{HVir}$-modules and the previously developed methods of constructing logarithmic modules we are able to construct a family of logarithmic $V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules. The Loewy diagrams of these logarithmic modules are completely analogous to the Loewy diagrams of projective modules of weight $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$-modules, so we expect that our logarithmic modules are also projective in a certain category of weight $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for moment map estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.14504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of positive operator valued measures associated with representations of compact connected Lie groups. For many independent copies of a single state and a tensor power representation we show that the observed probability distributions converge to the value of the moment map. For invertible states we prove that the measures satisfy the large deviation principle with an explicitly given rate function.</description>

      <title>Inertial Momentum Dissipation for Viscosity Solutions of Euler Equations: External Flow Around a Smooth Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local balance of momentum for weak solutions of incompressible Euler equations obtained from the zero-viscosity limit in the presence of solid boundaries, taking as an example flow around a finite, smooth body. We show that both viscous skin friction and wall pressure exist in the inviscid limit as distributions on the body surface. We define a nonlinear spatial flux of momentum toward the wall for the Euler solution, and show that wall friction and pressure are obtained from this momentum flux in the limit of vanishing distance to the wall, for the wall-parallel and wall-normal components, respectively. We show furthermore that the skin friction describing anomalous momentum transfer to the wall will vanish if velocity and pressure are bounded in a neighborhood of the wall and if also the essential supremum of wall-normal velocity within a small distance of the wall vanishes with this distance (a precise form of the vanishing wall-normal velocity condition). In the latter case, all of the limiting drag arises from pressure forces acting on the body and the pressure at the body surface can be obtained as the limit approaching the wall of the interior pressure for the Euler solution. As one application of this result, we show that Lighthill's theory of vorticity generation at the wall is valid for the Euler solutions obtained in the inviscid limit. Further, in a companion work, we show that the Josephson-Anderson relation for the drag, recently derived for strong Navier-Stokes solutions, is valid for weak Euler solutions obtained in their inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>Spectral quantization of discrete random walks on half-line, and orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define quantization scheme for discrete-time random walks on the half-line consistent with Szegedy's quantization of finite Markov chains. Motivated by the Karlin and McGregor description of discrete-time random walks in terms of polynomials orthogonal with respect to a measure with support in the segment $[-1,1]$, we represent the unitary evolution operator of the quantum walk in terms of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. We find the relation between transition probabilities of the random walk with the Verblunsky coefficients of the corresponding polynomials of the quantum walk. We show that the both polynomials systems and their measures are connected by the classical Szeg\H{o} map. Our scheme can be applied to arbitrary Karlin and McGregor random walks and generalizes the so called Cantero-Gr\"{u}nbaum-Moral-Vel\'{a}zquez method. We illustrate our approach on example of random walks related to the Jacobi polynomials. Then we study quantization of random walks with constant transition probabilities where the corresponding polynomials on the unit circle have two-periodic real Verblunsky coefficients. We present geometric construction of the spectrum of such polynomials (in the general complex case) which generalizes the known construction for the Geronimus polynomials. In the Appendix we present the explicit form, in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind, of polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle and polynomials orthogonal on the real line with coefficients of arbitrary period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2005 Lorenzoni and Magri showed that a hydrodynamic-type hierarchy determined by the powers of a type (1,1) tensor field (on a smooth manifold) with vanishing Nijenhuis torsion can be deformed to a more general hierarchy, with the help of a chain of conservation laws of the new hierarchy. We review this construction. The (1,1) tensor fields of the resulting hierarchy have non-vanishing Nijenhuis torsion, in general, but their Haantjes tensor vanishes.</description>

      <title>Distributions of consecutive level spacings of Gaussian unitary ensemble and their ratio: ab initio derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent studies of many-body localization in nonintegrable quantum systems, the distribution of the ratio of two consecutive energy level spacings, $r_n=(E_{n+1}-E_n)/(E_{n}-E_{n-1})$ or $\tilde{r}_n=\min(r_n,r_n^{-1})$, has been used as a measure to quantify the chaoticity, alternative to the more conventional distribution of the level spacings, $s_n=\bar{\rho}(E_n)(E_{n+1}-E_n)$, as the former makes unnecessary the unfolding required for the latter. Based on our previous work on the Tracy-Widom approach to the Janossy densities, we present analytic expressions for the joint probability distribution of two consecutive eigenvalue spacings and the distribution of their ratio for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) of random Hermitian $N\times N$ matrices at $N\to \infty$, in terms of a system of differential equations. As a showcase of the efficacy of our results for characterizing an approach to quantum chaoticity, we contrast them to arguably the most ideal of all quantum-chaotic spectra: the zeroes of the Riemann $\zeta$ function on the critical line at increasing heights.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

Abstract: We give a characterization, in terms of simplicial sets, of Frobenius objects in the category of relations. This result generalizes a result of Heunen, Contreras, and Cattaneo showing that special dagger Frobenius objects in the category of relations are in correspondence with groupoids. As an additional example, we construct a Frobenius object in the category of relations whose elements are certain cohomology classes in a compact oriented Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that we can retrieve a Yang--Mills potential and a Higgs field (up to gauge) from source-to-solution type data associated with the classical Yang--Mills--Higgs equations in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. We impose natural non-degeneracy conditions on the representation for the Higgs field and on the Lie algebra of the structure group which are satisfied for the case of the Standard Model. Our approach exploits the non-linear interaction of waves generated by sources with values in the centre of the Lie algebra showing that abelian components can be used effectively to recover the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Percolation for two-dimensional excursion clouds and the discrete Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study percolative properties of excursion processes and the discrete Gaussian free field (dGFF) in the planar unit disk. We consider discrete excursion clouds, defined using random walks as a two-dimensional version of random interlacements, as well as its scaling limit, defined using Brownian motion. We prove that the critical parameters associated to vacant set percolation for the two models are the same and equal to $\pi/3.$ The value is obtained from a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) computation. Via an isomorphism theorem, we use a generalization of the discrete result that also involves a loop soup (and an SLE computation) to show that the critical parameter associated to level set percolation for the dGFF is strictly positive and smaller than $\sqrt{\pi/2}.$ In particular this entails a strict inequality of the type $h_*&lt;\sqrt{2u_*}$ between the critical percolation parameters of the dGFF and the two-dimensional excursion cloud. Similar strict inequalities are conjectured to hold in a general transient setup.</description>

      <title>Quantum triangles and imaginary geometry flow lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a three-parameter family of random surfaces in Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) which can be viewed as the quantum version of triangles. These quantum triangles are natural in two senses. First, by our definition they produce the boundary three-point correlation functions of Liouville conformal field theory on the disk. Second, it turns out that the laws of the triangles bounded by flow lines in imaginary geometry coupled with LQG are given by these quantum triangles. In this paper we demonstrate the second point for boundary flow lines on a quantum disk. Our method has the potential to prove general conformal welding results with quantum triangles glued in an arbitrary way. Quantum triangles play a basic role in understanding the integrability of SLE and LQG via conformal welding. In this paper, we deduce integrability results for chordal SLE with three force points, using the conformal welding of a quantum triangle and a two-pointed quantum disk. In a subsequent work we will explore their applications to the mating-of-trees framework of LQG, including the exact evaluation of the expected proportion of inversions in skew Brownian permutons.</description>

      <title>On irreducibility of modules of Whittaker type: twisted modules and nonabelian orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.04649, we extended the Dong-Mason theorem on irreducibility of modules for cyclic orbifold vertex algebras to the entire category weak modules and applied this result to Whittaker modules. In this paper we present further generalizations of these results for nonabelian orbifolds of vertex operator superalgebras. Let $V$ be a vertex superalgebra with a countable dimension and let $G$ be a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(V)$. Assume that $h\in Z(G)$ where $Z(G)$ is the center of the group $G$. For any irreducible $h$-twisted (weak) $V$-module $M$, we prove that if $M\not\cong g\circ M$ for all $g\in G$ then $M$ is also irreducible as $V^G$-module. We also apply this result to examples and give irreducibility of modules of Whittaker type for orbifolds of Neveu-Schwarz vertex superalgebras, Heisenberg vertex algebras, Virasoro vertex operator algebra and Heisenberg-Virasoro vertex algebra.</description>

Abstract: We show that for the ground state of a one dimensional free electron gas on a circle the analytic expression for the canonical ensemble partition function can be easily derived from the density matrix by assuming that the thermodynamic limit coincides with the limit of the eigenfunction expansion of the kinetic energy. This approximation fails to give the finite temperature partition function because those two limits cannot be chosen as coincident.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa's conjecture that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed $ 3 $-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. In our previous work, the author attributed this conjecture to the holomorphy of certain rational functions by developing an asymptotic formula based on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it is challenging to prove holomorphy for general plumbed manifolds. In this paper, we address this challenge using induction on a sequence of trees obtained by repeating "pruning trees."</description>

Abstract: We first introduce a new model for a two-dimensional gauge-covariant wave equation with space-time white noise. In our main theorem, we obtain the probabilistic global well-posedness of this model in the Lorenz gauge. Furthermore, we prove the failure of a probabilistic null-form estimate, which exposes a potential obstruction towards the probabilistic well-posedness of a stochastic Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

Abstract: Landau levels are the eigenstates of a charged particle in two dimensions under a magnetic field, and are at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are two prototypical phenomena showing topological features. Following recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall phases in van der Waals materials, there is a rapid progress in understanding of the precise condition under which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized. It is now understood that the key to obtaining the fractional quantum Hall phases is the energy band whose eigenstates are holomorphic functions in both real and momentum space coordinates. Landau levels are indeed examples of such energy bands with an additional special property of having flat geometrical features. In this paper, we prove that, in fact, the only energy eigenstates having holomorphic wave functions with a flat geometry are the Landau levels and their higher Chern number analogs. Since it has been known that any holomorphic eigenstates can be constructed from the ones with a flat geometry such as the Landau levels, our uniqueness proof of the Landau levels allows one to construct any possible holomorphic eigenstate with which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between quantum entanglement, geometrical and dynamical appearances in N spin-$1/2$ system under all-range Ising model</title>

Abstract: With the growth of geometric science, including the methods of exploring the world of information by means of modern geometry, there has always been a mysterious and fascinating ambiguous link between geometric, topological and dynamical characteristics with quantum entanglement. Since geometry studies the interrelations between elements such as distance and curvature, it provides the information sciences with powerful structures that yield practically useful and understandable descriptions of integrable quantum systems. We explore here these structures in a physical system of $N$ interaction spin-$1/2$ under all-range Ising model. By performing the system dynamics, we determine the Fubini-Study metric defining the relevant quantum state space. Applying Gaussian curvature within the scope of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we proved that the dynamics happens on a closed two-dimensional manifold having both a dumbbell-shape structure and a spherical topology. The geometric and topological phases appearing during the system evolution processes are sufficiently discussed. Subsequently, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem by achieving the time-optimal evolution. By restricting the whole system to a two spin-$1/2$ system, we investigate the relevant entanglement from two viewpoints; The first is of geometric nature and explores how the entanglement level affects derived geometric structures such as the Fubini-Study metric, the Gaussian curvature, and the geometric phase. The second is of dynamic nature and addresses the entanglement effect on the evolution speed and the related Fubini-Study distance. Further, depending on the degree of entanglement, we resolve the quantum brachistochrone problem.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>

Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>Landau damping and survival threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system near general spatially homogenous equilibria $\mu(\frac12|v|^2)$ with connected support on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$ or on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$, including those that are non-monotone. The problem can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the "survival threshold" of wave numbers computed by $$\kappa_0^2 = 4\pi \int_0^\Upsilon \frac{u^2\mu(\frac12 u^2)}{\Upsilon^2-u^2} \;du$$ where $\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle velocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey a Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below the threshold, thus rigorously confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves known in the physical literature. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that causes the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of the background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the weaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of quarter-BPS local operators in four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the formalism of holomorphic twists. We study loop corrections both to the space of local operators and to algebraic operations which endow the twisted theory with an infinite symmetry algebra. We classify all single-trace quarter-BPS operators in the planar approximation for $SU(N)$ gauge theory and propose a holographic dual description for the twisted theory. We classify perturbative quarter-BPS operators in $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories with sufficiently small quantum numbers and discuss possible non-perturbative corrections to the answer. We set up analogous calculations for some theories with matter.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity, logarithmic stresses, and tensorial transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce models for viscoelastic materials, both solids and fluids, based on logarithmic stresses to capture the elastic contribution to the material response. The matrix logarithm allows to link the measures of strain, that naturally belong to a multiplicative group of linear transformations, to stresses, that are additive elements of a linear space of tensors. As regards the viscous stresses, we simply assume a Newtonian constitutive law, but the presence of elasticity and plastic relaxation makes the materials non-Newtonian. Our aim is to discuss the existence of weak solutions for the corresponding systems of partial differential equations in the nonlinear large-deformation regime. The main difficulties arise in the analysis of the transport equations necessary to describe the evolution of tensorial measures of strain. For the solid model, we only need to consider the equation for the left Cauchy-Green tensor, while for the fluid model we add an evolution equation for the elastically-relaxed strain. Due to the tensorial nature of the fields, available techniques cannot be applied to the analysis of such transport equations. To cope with this, we introduce the notion of charted weak solution, based on non-standard a priori estimates, that lead to a global-in-time existence of solutions for the viscoelastic models in the natural functional setting associated with the energy inequality.</description>

      <title>Evolution of local relaxed states and the modelling of viscoelastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of continuum mechanical models aimed at describing the behaviour of viscoelastic fluids by incorporating concepts originated in the theory of solid plasticity. Within this class, even a simple model with constant material parameters is able to qualitatively reproduce a number of experimental observations in both simple shear and extensional flows, including linear viscoelastic properties, the rate dependence of steady-state material functions, the stress overshoot in incipient shear flows, and the difference in shear and extensional rheological curves. Furthermore, by allowing the relaxation time of the model to depend on the total strain, we can reproduce some experimental observations of the non-attainability of steady flows in uniaxial extension, and link this to a concept of polymeric jamming or effective solidification. Remarkably, this modelling framework helps in understanding the interplay between different mechanisms that may compete in determining the rheology of non-Newtonian materials.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Universality in Physics, Computer Science, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turing machines and spin models share a notion of universality according to which some simulate all others. Is there a theory of universality that captures this notion? We set up a categorical framework for universality which includes as instances universal Turing machines, universal spin models, NP completeness, top of a preorder, denseness of a subset, and more. By identifying necessary conditions for universality, we show that universal spin models cannot be finite. We also characterize when universality can be distinguished from a trivial one and use it to show that universal Turing machines are non-trivial in this sense. Our framework allows not only to compare universalities within each instance, but also instances themselves. We leverage a Fixed Point Theorem inspired by a result of Lawvere to establish that universality and negation give rise to unreachability (such as uncomputability). As such, this work sets the basis for a unified approach to universality and invites the study of further examples within the framework.</description>

      <title>The inhomogeneous multispecies PushTASEP: Dynamics and symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a natural multispecies variant of the inhomogeneous PushTASEP with site-dependent rates on the finite ring. We show that the stationary distribution of this process is proportional to the ASEP polynomials at $q = 1$ and $t = 0$. This is done by constructing a multiline process which projects to the multispecies PushTASEP, and identifying its stationary distribution using time-reversal arguments. We also study symmetry properties of the process under interchange of the rates associated to the sites. These results hold not just for events depending on the configuration at a single time in equilibrium, but also for systems out of equilibrium and for events depending on the path of the process over time. Lastly, we give explicit formulas for nearest-neighbour two-point correlations in terms of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian Convexity for Logarithmic Moment Generating Functions with Applications in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any convex function $F$ of $n$-dimensional Gaussian vector $g$ with $\mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}&lt;\infty$ for any $\lambda&gt;0$, we show that $\lambda^{-1}\ln \mathbb{E} e^{\lambda F(g)}$ is convex in $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$. Based on this convexity, we draw three major consequences. The first recovers a version of the Paouris-Valettas lower deviation inequality for Gaussian convex functions with an improved exponent. The second establishes a quantitative bound for the Dotsenko-Franz-M\'ezard conjecture arising from the study of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) mean-field spin glass model, which states that in the absence of external field, the annealed free energy of negative replica is asymptotically equal to the free energy. The last further establishes the differentiability for this annealed free energy with respect to the negative replica variable at any temperature and external field.</description>

      <title>Algebraic aspects and functoriality of the set of affiliated operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to provide a satisfactory algebraic description of the set of affiliated operators for von Neumann algebras. Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, and let $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ denote the set of unbounded operators of the form $T = AB^{\dagger}$ for $A, B \in \mathscr{M}$ with $\ker(B)\subseteq\ker(A)$ , where $(\cdot)^{\dagger}$ denotes the Kaufman inverse. We show that $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is closed under product, sum, Kaufman-inverse and adjoint, and has the structure of a right near-semiring; Moreover, the above quotient representation of an operator in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is essentially unique. The Murray-von Neumann affiliated operators for $\mathscr{M}$ turn out to be precisely the closed operators in $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$. Let $\Phi$ be a unital normal homomorphism between represented von Neumann algebras $(\mathscr{M}; \mathcal{H})$ and $(\mathscr{N}; \mathcal{K})$. With the help of the quotient representation, we obtain a canonical extension of $\Phi$ to a mapping $\Phi_{\text{aff}} : \mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}} \to \mathscr{N}_{\text{aff}}$ which respects sum, product, Kaufman-inverse, and adjoint. Thus $\mathscr{M}_{\text{aff}}$ is intrinsically associated with $\mathscr{M}$ and transforms functorially as we change representations of $\mathscr{M}$. Furthermore, $\Phi_{\text{aff}}$ preserves operator properties such as being symmetric, or positive, or accretive, or sectorial, or self-adjoint, or normal, and also preserves the Friedrichs and Krein-von Neumann extensions of densely-defined closed positive operators. As a proof of concept, we transfer some well-known results about closed unbounded operators to the setting of closed affiliated operators for properly infinite von Neumann algebras, via `abstract nonsense'.</description>

      <title>Universality of closed nested paths in two-dimensional percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on percolation in $d=2$ [J. Phys. A {\bf 55} 204002] introduced an operator that gives a weight $k^{\ell}$ to configurations with $\ell$ `nested paths' (NP), i.e. disjoint cycles surrounding the origin, if there exists a cluster that percolates to the boundary of a disc of radius $L$, and weight zero otherwise. It was found that ${\rm E}(k^{\ell}) \sim L^{-X_{\rm NP}(k)}$, and a formula for $X_{\rm NP}(k)$ was conjectured. Here we derive an exact result for $X_{\rm NP}(k)$, valid for $k \ge -1$, replacing the previous conjecture. We find that the probability distribution ${\rm P}_\ell (L)$ scales as $ L^{-1/4} (\ln L)^\ell [(1/\ell!) \Lambda^\ell]$ when $\ell \geq 0$ and $L \gg 1$, with $\Lambda = 1/\sqrt{3} \pi$. Extensive simulations for various critical percolation models confirm our theoretical predictions and support the universality of the NP observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an equivalence between force-free fields and conformally geodesic fields, and between harmonic fields and conformally eikonal fields in the context of conformal geometry. In contrast to previous work, our approach and equivalence results generalize to arbitrary dimensions. In accordance with three-dimensional theory, our defining equations emerge as the Euler-Lagrange equations of hierarchies of variational principles - distinguished by the topological constraints they impose - and retain the known inclusions of the special cases from each other. Specifically, we relate stationary points of hierarchies of $L^2$ resp. $L^1$-optimization problems by a conformal change of metric, provide an explicit construction of the conformal factors relating the relevant metrics and identify the field lines of physical vector fields fields as conformal geodesics. Despite the allowed topological complexity of the fields under consideration, these observations reveal geometric order which is obtained by merely pointwise rescaling of the metric.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we have reached from the most basic definitions in the theory of groups, group structures, etc. to representation theory and irreducible representations of the Poincar'e group. Also, we tried to get a more comprehensible understanding of group theory by presenting examples from the nature around us to examples in mathematics and physics and using them to examine more important groups in physics such as the Lorentz group and Poincar'e group and representations It is achieved in the physical fields that are used in the quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Cosmological Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth map \(g: X \to U(N)\), where \(X\) is three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number is defined as \(W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]\). We introduce a method to compute \(W_3\) using a discrete approximation of \(X\) that manifestly ensures the quantization of \(W_3\).</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(r)$ with $r\equiv |x|$. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. In addition, we also derive a set of spatial decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the time-asymptotic stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ using the energy method. More specifically, we prove this under small initial perturbation on $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, provided that the density at the far-field is supposed to be strictly positive but suitably small, in other words, the far-field state of the fluid is not vacuum but suitably rarefied. The main difficulty for the proof is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a proof of 5D $A_n$ AGT conjecture at $\beta=1$, where the gauge theory side is one dimension higher than the original 4D case, and corresponds to the q-deformation of the 2D conformal field theory side. We define a q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg integral, which generalizes the $A_n$ Selberg integral and the q-deformed $A_1$ Selberg integral in the literature. A q-deformed $A_n$ Selberg average formula with $n+1$ Schur polynomials is proposed and proved to complete the proof.</description>

      <title>Is the Born rule a result of measurement noise?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule asserts the probability distribution of eigenstates observed in unbiased quantum measurements, but the reason it holds remains elusive. This manuscript discusses how the Born rule might be explained by Schrodinger equation dynamics, if a measurement comprises a system responding to random fluctuations until it is within an arbitrarily small tolerance of a measurement eigenstate. We describe the random walk dynamics that produce this behavior in terms of a class of time-dependent, stochastic unitary matrices U(t). We also discuss the class of stochastic potential energies in the Schrodinger equation that is equivalent to this class of unitary matrices.
  This analysis raises some questions worth considering, including how to determine if any measurements actually follow the predicted random walk mechanism and whether a reliable measurement apparatus could be designed that deviates from Born rule probabilities. Interestingly, if any measurements do follow this random walk mechanism, then exposing a quantum system to stochastic 'noise' is an intrinsic part of such a measurement, not merely an unwanted side effect. This characteristic would have implications for reducing noise in quantum sensing and quantum computing.
  This is a draft of a work in progress. Questions and suggestions are welcome.</description>

      <title>Curie-Weiss Model under $\ell^{p}$ constraint and a Generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising Curie-Weiss model on the complete graph constrained under a given $\ell^{p}$ norm for some $p&gt;0$. For $p=\infty$, it reduces to the classical Ising Curie-Weiss model. We prove that for all $p&gt;2$, there exists $\beta_{c}(p)$ such that for $\beta&lt;\beta_{c}(p)$, the magnetization is concentrated at zero and satisfies an appropriate Gaussian CLT. In contrast, for $\beta&gt;\beta_{c}(p)$ the magnetization is concentrated at $\pm m_\ast$ for some $m_\ast&gt;0$. We have $\beta_{c}(p)&gt;1$ for $p&gt;2$ and $\lim_{p\to\infty}\beta_{c}(p)=3$. We further generalize the model for general symmetric spin distributions and prove a similar phase transition. For $0&lt;p&lt;1$, the log-partition function scales at the order of $n^{2/p-1}$. The proofs are based on a generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich (GHS) transform, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Self-dualities and Galois symmetries in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that all Feynman integrals within a given family can be expressed as a finite linear combination of master integrals. The master integrals naturally group into sectors. Starting from two loops, there can exist sectors made up of more than one master integral. In this paper we show that such sectors may have additional symmetries. First of all, self-duality, which was first observed in Feynman integrals related to Calabi--Yau geometries, often carries over to non-Calabi--Yau Feynman integrals. Secondly, we show that in addition there can exist Galois symmetries relating integrals. In the simplest case of two master integrals within a sector, whose definition involves a square root $r$, we may choose a basis $(I_1,I_2)$ such that $I_2$ is obtained from $I_1$ by the substitution $r \rightarrow -r$. This pattern also persists in sectors, which a priori are not related to any square root with dependence on the kinematic variables. We show in several examples that in such cases a suitable redefinition of the integrals introduces constant square roots like $\sqrt{3}$. The new master integrals are then again related by a Galois symmetry, for example the substitution $\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3}$. To handle the case where the argument of a square root would be a perfect square we introduce a limit Galois symmetry. Both self-duality and Galois symmetries constrain the differential equation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the general structure of the three-point functions involving conserved higher-spin ``vector-like" supercurrents $J_{s}(z) := J_{\alpha(s) \dot{\alpha}(s)}(z)$ in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory. Using the constraints of superconformal symmetry and superfield conservation equations, we utilise a computational approach to analyse the general structure of the three-point function $\langle J^{}_{s_{1}}(z_{1}) \, J'_{s_{2}}(z_{2}) \, J''_{s_{3}}(z_{3}) \rangle$ and provide a general classification of the results. We demonstrate that the three-point function is fixed up to $2 \min (s_{i}) + 2$ independent conserved structures, which we propose to hold for arbitrary superspins. In addition, we show that the conserved structures can be classified as parity-even or parity-odd in superspace based on their transformation properties under superinversion.</description>

      <title>New edge modes and corner charges for first-order symmetries of 4D gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of noncommuting frame-translation symmetries in 4D gravity in tetrad-connection variables, which allow expressing diffeomorphisms as composite transformations. Working on the phase space level for finite regions, we pay close attention to the corner piece of the generators, discuss various possible charge brackets, relative definitions of the charges, coupling to spinors and relations to other charges. What emerges is a picture of the symmetries and edge modes of gravity that bears local resemblance to a Poincare group $SO(1,3)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, but possesses structure functions. In particular, we argue that the symmetries and charges presented here are more amenable to discretisation, and sketch a strategy for this charge algebra, geared toward quantum gravity applications.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite waves of degenerate Oleinik shock and rarefaction for non-convex conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the large-time behavior of the solution to one-dimensional (1D) cubic non-convex scalar viscous conservation laws. Due to the inflection point of the cubic non-convex flux, the solution to the corresponding inviscid Riemann problem can be the composite wave of a degenerate Oleinik shock and a rarefaction wave and these two nonlinear waves are always attached together. We give a first proof of the time-asymptotic stability of this composite wave, up to a time-dependent shift to the viscous Oleinik shock, for the viscous equation. The Oleinik shock wave strength can be arbitrarily large. The main difficulty is due to the incompatibility of the time-asymptotic stability proof framework of individual viscous shock by the so-called anti-derivative method and the direct $L^2$-energy method to rarefaction wave. Here we develop a new type of $a$-contraction method with suitable weight function and the time-dependent shift to the viscous shock, which is motivated by [9,12]. Another difficulty comes from that the Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave are always attached together and their wave interactions are very subtle. Therefore, the same time-dependent shift needs to be equipped to both Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave such that the wave interactions can be treated in our stability proof. Time-asymptotically, this shift function grows strictly sub-linear with respect to the time and then the shifted rarefaction wave is equivalent to the original self-similar rarefaction wave.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>

      <title>On Symmetries of Finite Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isospectral set of the Dirac matrix D=d+d* consists of orthogonal Q for which Q* D Q is an equivalent Dirac matrix. It can serve as the symmetry of a finite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary group and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt D=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the Toda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

      <title>The universe is not a Lie, but actually an Hopf, algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models -- developed to approach spacetime quantization -- can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many future of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models.</description>
