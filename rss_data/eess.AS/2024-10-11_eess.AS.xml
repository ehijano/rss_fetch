      <title>Swin-BERT: A Feature Fusion System designed for Speech-based Alzheimer's Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech is usually used for constructing an automatic Alzheimer's dementia (AD) detection system, as the acoustic and linguistic abilities show a decline in people living with AD at the early stages. However, speech includes not only AD-related local and global information but also other information unrelated to cognitive status, such as age and gender. In this paper, we propose a speech-based system named Swin-BERT for automatic dementia detection. For the acoustic part, the shifted windows multi-head attention that proposed to extract local and global information from images, is used for designing our acoustic-based system. To decouple the effect of age and gender on acoustic feature extraction, they are used as an extra input of the designed acoustic system. For the linguistic part, the rhythm-related information, which varies significantly between people living with and without AD, is removed while transcribing the audio recordings into transcripts. To compensate for the removed rhythm-related information, the character-level transcripts are proposed to be used as the extra input of a word-level BERT-style system. Finally, the Swin-BERT combines the acoustic features learned from our proposed acoustic-based system with our linguistic-based system. The experiments are based on the two datasets provided by the international dementia detection challenges: the ADReSS and ADReSSo. The results show that both the proposed acoustic and linguistic systems can be better or comparable with previous research on the two datasets. Superior results are achieved by the proposed Swin-BERT system on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets, which are 85.58\% F-score and 87.32\% F-score respectively.</description>

      <title>Learn from Real: Reality Defender's Submission to ASVspoof5 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection is crucial to combat the malicious use of AI-synthesized speech. Among many efforts undertaken by the community, the ASVspoof challenge has become one of the benchmarks to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of detection models. In this paper, we present Reality Defender's submission to the ASVspoof5 challenge, highlighting a novel pretraining strategy which significantly improves generalizability while maintaining low computational cost during training. Our system SLIM learns the style-linguistics dependency embeddings from various types of bonafide speech using self-supervised contrastive learning. The learned embeddings help to discriminate spoof from bonafide speech by focusing on the relationship between the style and linguistics aspects. We evaluated our system on ASVspoof5, ASV2019, and In-the-wild. Our submission achieved minDCF of 0.1499 and EER of 5.5% on ASVspoof5 Track 1, and EER of 7.4% and 10.8% on ASV2019 and In-the-wild respectively.</description>

      <title>Robust Fixed-Filter Sound Zone Control with Audio-Based Position Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance of sound zone control (SZC) systems deployed in practical scenarios are highly sensitive to the location of the listener(s) and can degrade significantly when listener(s) are moving. This paper presents a robust SZC system that adapts to dynamic changes such as moving listeners and varying zone locations using a dictionary-based approach. The proposed system continuously monitors the environment and updates the fixed control filters by tracking the listener position using audio signals only. To test the effectiveness of the proposed SZC method, simulation studies are carried out using practically measured impulse responses. These studies show that SZC, when incorporated with the proposed audio-only position tracking scheme, achieves optimal performance when all listener positions are available in the dictionary. Moreover, even when not all listener positions are included in the dictionary, the method still provides good performance improvement compared to a traditional fixed filter SZC scheme.</description>

      <title>Sound Zone Control Robust To Sound Speed Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound zone control (SZC) implemented using static optimal filters is significantly affected by various perturbations in the acoustic environment, an important one being the fluctuation in the speed of sound, which is in turn influenced by changes in temperature and humidity (TH). This issue arises because control algorithms typically use pre-recorded, static impulse responses (IRs) to design the optimal control filters. The IRs, however, may change with time due to TH changes, which renders the derived control filters to become non-optimal. To address this challenge, we propose a straightforward model called sinc interpolation-compression/expansion-resampling (SICER), which adjusts the IRs to account for both sound speed reduction and increase. Using the proposed technique, IRs measured at a certain TH can be corrected for any TH change and control filters can be re-derived without the need of re-measuring the new IRs (which is impractical when SZC is deployed). We integrate the proposed SICER IR correction method with the recently introduced variable span trade-off (VAST) framework for SZC, and propose a SICER-corrected VAST method that is resilient to sound speed variations. Simulation studies show that the proposed SICER-corrected VAST approach significantly improves acoustic contrast and reduces signal distortion in the presence of sound speed changes.</description>

      <title>Window Function-less DFT with Reduced Noise and Latency for Real-Time Music Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music analysis applications demand algorithms that can provide both high time and frequency resolution while minimizing noise in an already-noisy signal. Real-time analysis additionally demands low latency and low computational requirements. We propose a DFT-based algorithm that accomplishes all these requirements by extending a method that post-processes DFT output without the use of window functions. Our approach yields greatly reduced sidelobes and noise, and improves time resolution without sacrificing frequency resolution. We use exponentially spaced output bins which directly map to notes in music. The resulting improved performance, compared to existing FFT and DFT-based approaches, creates possibilities for improved real-time visualizations, and contributes to improved analysis quality in other applications such as automatic transcription.</description>

      <title>Advocating Character Error Rate for Multilingual ASR Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have traditionally been evaluated using English datasets, with the word error rate (WER) serving as the predominant metric. WER's simplicity and ease of interpretation have contributed to its widespread adoption, particularly for English. However, as ASR systems expand to multilingual contexts, WER fails in various ways, particularly with morphologically complex languages or those without clear word boundaries. Our work documents the limitations of WER as an evaluation metric and advocates for the character error rate (CER) as the primary metric in multilingual ASR evaluation. We show that CER avoids many of the challenges WER faces and exhibits greater consistency across writing systems. We support our proposition by conducting human evaluations of ASR transcriptions in three languages: Malayalam, English, and Arabic, which exhibit distinct morphological characteristics. We show that CER correlates more closely with human judgments than WER, even for English. To facilitate further research, we release our human evaluation dataset for future benchmarking of ASR metrics. Our findings suggest that CER should be prioritized, or at least supplemented, in multilingual ASR evaluations to account for the varying linguistic characteristics of different languages.</description>

      <title>Toward Robust Real-World Audio Deepfake Detection: Closing the Explainability Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-manipulated or generated audio deepfakes poses serious challenges to media integrity and election security. Current AI-driven detection solutions lack explainability and underperform in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce novel explainability methods for state-of-the-art transformer-based audio deepfake detectors and open-source a novel benchmark for real-world generalizability. By narrowing the explainability gap between transformer-based audio deepfake detectors and traditional methods, our results not only build trust with human experts, but also pave the way for unlocking the potential of citizen intelligence to overcome the scalability issue in audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Transducer Consistency Regularization for Speech to Text Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consistency regularization is a commonly used practice to encourage the model to generate consistent representation from distorted input features and improve model generalization. It shows significant improvement on various speech applications that are optimized with cross entropy criterion. However, it is not straightforward to apply consistency regularization for the transducer-based approaches, which are widely adopted for speech applications due to the competitive performance and streaming characteristic. The main challenge is from the vast alignment space of the transducer optimization criterion and not all the alignments within the space contribute to the model optimization equally. In this study, we present Transducer Consistency Regularization (TCR), a consistency regularization method for transducer models. We apply distortions such as spec augmentation and dropout to create different data views and minimize the distribution difference. We utilize occupational probabilities to give different weights on transducer output distributions, thus only alignments close to oracle alignments would contribute to the model learning. Our experiments show the proposed method is superior to other consistency regularization implementations and could effectively reduce word error rate (WER) by 4.3\% relatively comparing with a strong baseline on the \textsc{Librispeech} dataset.</description>

      <title>Audio Explanation Synthesis with Generative Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing success of audio foundation models across various tasks has led to a growing need for improved interpretability to understand their intricate decision-making processes better. Existing methods primarily focus on explaining these models by attributing importance to elements within the input space based on their influence on the final decision. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio explanation method that capitalises on the generative capacity of audio foundation models. Our method leverages the intrinsic representational power of the embedding space within these models by integrating established feature attribution techniques to identify significant features in this space. The method then generates listenable audio explanations by prioritising the most important features. Through rigorous benchmarking against standard datasets, including keyword spotting and speech emotion recognition, our model demonstrates its efficacy in producing audio explanations.</description>

      <title>Full-Rank No More: Low-Rank Weight Training for Modern Speech Recognition Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the under-explored area of low-rank weight training for large-scale Conformer-based speech recognition models from scratch. Our study demonstrates the viability of this training paradigm for such models, yielding several notable findings. Firstly, we discover that applying a low-rank structure exclusively to the attention modules can unexpectedly enhance performance, even with a significant rank reduction of 12%. In contrast, feed-forward layers present greater challenges, as they begin to exhibit performance degradation with a moderate 50% rank reduction. Furthermore, we find that both initialization and layer-wise rank assignment play critical roles in successful low-rank training. Specifically, employing SVD initialization and linear layer-wise rank mapping significantly boosts the efficacy of low-rank weight training. Building on these insights, we introduce the Low-Rank Speech Model from Scratch (LR-SMS), an approach that achieves performance parity with full-rank training while delivering substantial reductions in parameters count (by at least 2x), and training time speedups (by 1.3x for ASR and 1.15x for AVSR).</description>

      <title>Automating Urban Soundscape Enhancements with AI: In-situ Assessment of Quality and Restorativeness in Traffic-Exposed Residential Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formalized in ISO 12913, the "soundscape" approach is a paradigmatic shift towards perception-based urban sound management, aiming to alleviate the substantial socioeconomic costs of noise pollution to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Focusing on traffic-exposed outdoor residential sites, we implemented an automatic masker selection system (AMSS) utilizing natural sounds to mask (or augment) traffic soundscapes. We employed a pre-trained AI model to automatically select the optimal masker and adjust its playback level, adapting to changes over time in the ambient environment to maximize "Pleasantness", a perceptual dimension of soundscape quality in ISO 12913. Our validation study involving ($N=68$) residents revealed a significant 14.6 % enhancement in "Pleasantness" after intervention, correlating with increased restorativeness and positive affect. Perceptual enhancements at the traffic-exposed site matched those at a quieter control site with 6 dB(A) lower $L_\text{A,eq}$ and road traffic noise dominance, affirming the efficacy of AMSS as a soundscape intervention, while streamlining the labour-intensive assessment of "Pleasantness" with probabilistic AI prediction.</description>

      <title>Speeding Up Speech Synthesis In Diffusion Models By Reducing Data Distribution Recovery Steps Via Content Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion based vocoders have been criticised for being slow due to the many steps required during sampling. Moreover, the model's loss function that is popularly implemented is designed such that the target is the original input $x_0$ or error $\epsilon_0$. For early time steps of the reverse process, this results in large prediction errors, which can lead to speech distortions and increase the learning time. We propose a setup where the targets are the different outputs of forward process time steps with a goal to reduce the magnitude of prediction errors and reduce the training time. We use the different layers of a neural network (NN) to perform denoising by training them to learn to generate representations similar to the noised outputs in the forward process of the diffusion. The NN layers learn to progressively denoise the input in the reverse process until finally the final layer estimates the clean speech. To avoid 1:1 mapping between layers of the neural network and the forward process steps, we define a skip parameter $\tau&gt;1$ such that an NN layer is trained to cumulatively remove the noise injected in the $\tau$ steps in the forward process. This significantly reduces the number of data distribution recovery steps and, consequently, the time to generate speech. We show through extensive evaluation that the proposed technique generates high-fidelity speech in competitive time that outperforms current state-of-the-art tools. The proposed technique is also able to generalize well to unseen speech.</description>

      <title>BirdSet: A Large-Scale Dataset for Audio Classification in Avian Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has greatly advanced audio classification, yet the field is limited by the scarcity of large-scale benchmark datasets that have propelled progress in other domains. While AudioSet aims to bridge this gap as a universal-domain dataset, its restricted accessibility and lack of diverse real-world evaluation use cases challenge its role as the primary resource. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{BirdSet}$, a large-scale benchmark dataset for audio classification focusing on avian bioacoustics. $\texttt{BirdSet}$ surpasses AudioSet with over 6,800 recording hours ($\uparrow\!17\%$) from nearly 10,000 classes ($\uparrow\!18\times$) for training and more than 400 hours ($\uparrow\!7\times$) across eight strongly labeled evaluation datasets. It serves as a versatile resource for use cases such as multi-label classification, covariate shift or self-supervised learning. We benchmark six well-known DL models in multi-label classification across three distinct training scenarios and outline further evaluation use cases in audio classification. We host our dataset on Hugging Face for easy accessibility and offer an extensive codebase to reproduce our results.</description>

      <title>SongTrans: An unified song transcription and alignment method for lyrics and notes</title>

Abstract: The quantity of processed data is crucial for advancing the field of singing voice synthesis. While there are tools available for lyric or note transcription tasks, they all need pre-processed data which is relatively time-consuming (e.g., vocal and accompaniment separation). Besides, most of these tools are designed to address a single task and struggle with aligning lyrics and notes (i.e., identifying the corresponding notes of each word in lyrics). To address those challenges, we first design a pipeline by optimizing existing tools and annotating numerous lyric-note pairs of songs. Then, based on the annotated data, we train a unified SongTrans model that can directly transcribe lyrics and notes while aligning them simultaneously, without requiring pre-processing songs. Our SongTrans model consists of two modules: (1) the \textbf{Autoregressive module} predicts the lyrics, along with the duration and note number corresponding to each word in a lyric. (2) the \textbf{Non-autoregressive module} predicts the pitch and duration of the notes. Our experiments demonstrate that SongTrans achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in both lyric and note transcription tasks. Furthermore, it is the first model capable of aligning lyrics with notes. Experimental results demonstrate that the SongTrans model can effectively adapt to different types of songs (e.g., songs with accompaniment), showcasing its versatility for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>SONAR: A Synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice-Conversion (VC) using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have made it possible to generate high-quality and realistic human-like audio. This introduces significant challenges to distinguishing AI-synthesized speech from the authentic human voice and could raise potential issues of misuse for malicious purposes such as impersonation and fraud, spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and scams. However, existing detection techniques for AI-synthesized audio have not kept pace and often exhibit poor generalization across diverse datasets. In this paper, we introduce SONAR, a synthetic AI-Audio Detection Framework and Benchmark, aiming to provide a comprehensive evaluation for distinguishing cutting-edge AI-synthesized auditory content. SONAR includes a novel evaluation dataset sourced from 9 diverse audio synthesis platforms, including leading TTS providers and state-of-the-art TTS models. It is the first framework to uniformly benchmark AI-audio detection across both traditional and foundation model-based deepfake detection systems. Through extensive experiments, we reveal the generalization limitations of existing detection methods and demonstrate that foundation models exhibit stronger generalization capabilities, which can be attributed to their model size and the scale and quality of pretraining data. Additionally, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of few-shot fine-tuning in improving generalization, highlighting its potential for tailored applications, such as personalized detection systems for specific entities or individuals. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Jessegator/SONAR.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Segmentation Model for Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mamba is a newly proposed architecture which behaves like a recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention-like capabilities. These properties are promising for speaker diarization, as attention-based models have unsuitable memory requirements for long-form audio, and traditional RNN capabilities are too limited. In this paper, we propose to assess the potential of Mamba for diarization by comparing the state-of-the-art neural segmentation of the pyannote pipeline with our proposed Mamba-based variant. Mamba's stronger processing capabilities allow usage of longer local windows, which significantly improve diarization quality by making the speaker embedding extraction more reliable. We find Mamba to be a superior alternative to both traditional RNN and the tested attention-based model. Our proposed Mamba-based system achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely used diarization datasets.</description>
