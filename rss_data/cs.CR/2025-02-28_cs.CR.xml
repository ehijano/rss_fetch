      <title>No, of course I can! Refusal Mechanisms Can Be Exploited Using Harmless Fine-Tuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers implement filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine-tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this context: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest. 3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, ``No, Of course I Can Execute'' (NOICE), which exploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses. By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety before fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and a closed-source model (GPT-4o). We show an attack success rate (ASR) of 57% against GPT-4o; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of 3.25 times compared to the best performing previous attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive refusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harmless data.</description>

      <title>Atlas: A Framework for ML Lifecycle Provenance &amp; Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of open source machine learning (ML) datasets and models exposes today's AI applications to critical risks like data poisoning and supply chain attacks across the ML lifecycle. With growing regulatory pressure to address these issues through greater transparency, ML model vendors face challenges balancing these requirements against confidentiality for data and intellectual property needs. We propose Atlas, a framework that enables fully attestable ML pipelines. Atlas leverages open specifications for data and software supply chain provenance to collect verifiable records of model artifact authenticity and end-to-end lineage metadata. Atlas combines trusted hardware and transparency logs to enhance metadata integrity, preserve data confidentiality, and limit unauthorized access during ML pipeline operations, from training through deployment. Our prototype implementation of Atlas integrates several open-source tools to build an ML lifecycle transparency system, and assess the practicality of Atlas through two case study ML pipelines.</description>

      <title>TAPE: Tailored Posterior Difference for Auditing of Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of Web-based platforms handling vast amounts of user data, machine unlearning has emerged as a crucial mechanism to uphold users' right to be forgotten, enabling individuals to request the removal of their specified data from trained models. However, the auditing of machine unlearning processes remains significantly underexplored. Although some existing methods offer unlearning auditing by leveraging backdoors, these backdoor-based approaches are inefficient and impractical, as they necessitate involvement in the initial model training process to embed the backdoors. In this paper, we propose a TAilored Posterior diffErence (TAPE) method to provide unlearning auditing independently of original model training. We observe that the process of machine unlearning inherently introduces changes in the model, which contains information related to the erased data. TAPE leverages unlearning model differences to assess how much information has been removed through the unlearning operation. Firstly, TAPE mimics the unlearned posterior differences by quickly building unlearned shadow models based on first-order influence estimation. Secondly, we train a Reconstructor model to extract and evaluate the private information of the unlearned posterior differences to audit unlearning. Existing privacy reconstructing methods based on posterior differences are only feasible for model updates of a single sample. To enable the reconstruction effective for multi-sample unlearning requests, we propose two strategies, unlearned data perturbation and unlearned influence-based division, to augment the posterior difference. Extensive experimental results indicate the significant superiority of TAPE over the state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, at least 4.5$\times$ efficiency speedup and supporting the auditing for broader unlearning scenarios.</description>

      <title>SCU: An Efficient Machine Unlearning Scheme for Deep Learning Enabled Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) enabled semantic communications leverage DL to train encoders and decoders (codecs) to extract and recover semantic information. However, most semantic training datasets contain personal private information. Such concerns call for enormous requirements for specified data erasure from semantic codecs when previous users hope to move their data from the semantic system. {Existing machine unlearning solutions remove data contribution from trained models, yet usually in supervised sole model scenarios. These methods are infeasible in semantic communications that often need to jointly train unsupervised encoders and decoders.} In this paper, we investigate the unlearning problem in DL-enabled semantic communications and propose a semantic communication unlearning (SCU) scheme to tackle the problem. {SCU includes two key components. Firstly,} we customize the joint unlearning method for semantic codecs, including the encoder and decoder, by minimizing mutual information between the learned semantic representation and the erased samples. {Secondly,} to compensate for semantic model utility degradation caused by unlearning, we propose a contrastive compensation method, which considers the erased data as the negative samples and the remaining data as the positive samples to retrain the unlearned semantic models contrastively. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on three representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Tip of Efficiency: Uncovering the Submerged Threats of Jailbreak Attacks in Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have become increasingly prominent in the deployment on edge devices due to their high efficiency and low computational cost. While researchers continue to advance the capabilities of SLMs through innovative training strategies and model compression techniques, the security risks of SLMs have received considerably less attention compared to large language models (LLMs).To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the security performance of 13 state-of-the-art SLMs under various jailbreak attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that most SLMs are quite susceptible to existing jailbreak attacks, while some of them are even vulnerable to direct harmful prompts.To address the safety concerns, we evaluate several representative defense methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in enhancing the security of SLMs. We further analyze the potential security degradation caused by different SLM techniques including architecture compression, quantization, knowledge distillation, and so on. We expect that our research can highlight the security challenges of SLMs and provide valuable insights to future work in developing more robust and secure SLMs.</description>

      <title>Modern DDoS Threats and Countermeasures: Insights into Emerging Attacks and Detection Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks persist as significant threats to online services and infrastructure, evolving rapidly in sophistication and eluding traditional detection mechanisms. This evolution demands a comprehensive examination of current trends in DDoS attacks and the efficacy of modern detection strategies. This paper offers an comprehensive survey of emerging DDoS attacks and detection strategies over the past decade. We delve into the diversification of attack targets, extending beyond conventional web services to include newer network protocols and systems, and the adoption of advanced adversarial tactics. Additionally, we review current detection techniques, highlighting essential features that modern systems must integrate to effectively neutralize these evolving threats. Given the technological demands of contemporary network systems, such as high-volume and in-line packet processing capabilities, we also explore how innovative hardware technologies like programmable switches can significantly enhance the development and deployment of robust DDoS detection systems. We conclude by identifying open problems and proposing future directions for DDoS research. In particular, our survey sheds light on the investigation of DDoS attack surfaces for emerging systems, protocols, and adversarial strategies. Moreover, we outlines critical open questions in the development of effective detection systems, e.g., the creation of defense mechanisms independent of control planes.</description>

      <title>SSD: A State-based Stealthy Backdoor Attack For Navigation System in UAV Route Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed to perform high-risk tasks that require minimal human intervention. However, UAVs face escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly from GNSS spoofing attacks. While previous studies have extensively investigated the impacts of GNSS spoofing on UAVs, few have focused on its effects on specific tasks. Moreover, the influence of UAV motion states on the assessment of network security risks is often overlooked. To address these gaps, we first provide a detailed evaluation of how motion states affect the effectiveness of network attacks. We demonstrate that nonlinear motion states not only enhance the effectiveness of position spoofing in GNSS spoofing attacks but also reduce the probability of speed-related attack detection. Building upon this, we propose a state-triggered backdoor attack method (SSD) to deceive GNSS systems and assess its risk to trajectory planning tasks. Extensive validation of SSD's effectiveness and stealthiness is conducted. Experimental results show that, with appropriately tuned hyperparameters, SSD significantly increases positioning errors and the risk of task failure, while maintaining 100% stealth across three state-of-the-art detectors.</description>

      <title>URL Inspection Tasks: Helping Users Detect Phishing Links in Emails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most widespread type of phishing attack involves email messages with links pointing to malicious content. Despite user training and the use of detection techniques, these attacks are still highly effective. Recent studies show that it is user inattentiveness, rather than lack of education, that is one of the key factors in successful phishing attacks. To this end, we develop a novel phishing defense mechanism based on URL inspection tasks: small challenges (loosely inspired by CAPTCHAs) that, to be solved, require users to interact with, and understand, the basic URL structure. We implemented and evaluated three tasks that act as ``barriers'' to visiting the website: (1) correct click-selection from a list of URLs, (2) mouse-based highlighting of the domain-name URL component, and (3) re-typing the domain-name. These tasks follow best practices in security interfaces and warning design.
  We assessed the efficacy of these tasks through an extensive on-line user study with 2,673 participants from three different cultures, native languages, and alphabets. Results show that these tasks significantly decrease the rate of successful phishing attempts, compared to the baseline case. Results also showed the highest efficacy for difficult URLs, such as typo-squats, with which participants struggled the most. This highlights the importance of (1) slowing down users while focusing their attention and (2) helping them understand the URL structure (especially, the domain-name component thereof) and matching it to their intent.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the long-term viability of eye-tracking for continuous authentication in virtual reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and biometrics, verify a user's identity only at the start of a session, leaving systems vulnerable to session hijacking. Continuous authentication, however, ensures ongoing verification by monitoring user behavior. This study investigates the long-term feasibility of eye-tracking as a behavioral biometric for continuous authentication in virtual reality (VR) environments, using data from the GazebaseVR dataset. Our approach evaluates three architectures, Transformer Encoder, DenseNet, and XGBoost, on short and long-term data to determine their efficacy in user identification tasks. Initial results indicate that both Transformer Encoder and DenseNet models achieve high accuracy rates of up to 97% in short-term settings, effectively capturing unique gaze patterns. However, when tested on data collected 26 months later, model accuracy declined significantly, with rates as low as 1.78% for some tasks. To address this, we propose periodic model updates incorporating recent data, restoring accuracy to over 95%. These findings highlight the adaptability required for gaze-based continuous authentication systems and underscore the need for model retraining to manage evolving user behavior. Our study provides insights into the efficacy and limitations of eye-tracking as a biometric for VR authentication, paving the way for adaptive, secure VR user experiences.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Anomaly Detection (RAAD): Nimble Model Adjustment Without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for real-time (human-in-the-loop) feedback focused on false positive reduction to enhance anomaly detection models. It was designed for the lightweight deployment of a behavioral network anomaly detection model. This methodology is easily integrable to similar domains that require a premium on throughput while maintaining high precision. In this paper, we introduce Retrieval Augmented Anomaly Detection, a novel method taking inspiration from Retrieval Augmented Generation. Human annotated examples are sent to a vector store, which can modify model outputs on the very next processed batch for model inference. To demonstrate the generalization of this technique, we benchmarked several different model architectures and multiple data modalities, including images, text, and graph-based data.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Security Weaknesses in Autonomous Driving Systems: An In-Depth Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) has marked a significant shift towards intelligent transportation, with implications for public safety and traffic efficiency. While these systems integrate a variety of technologies and offer numerous benefits, their security is paramount, as vulnerabilities can have severe consequences for safety and trust. This study aims to systematically investigate potential security weaknesses in the codebases of prominent open-source ADS projects using CodeQL, a static code analysis tool. The goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, their distribution and persistence across versions to enhance the security of ADS. We selected three representative open-source ADS projects, Autoware, AirSim, and Apollo, based on their high GitHub star counts and Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities. Using CodeQL, we analyzed multiple versions of these projects to identify vulnerabilities, focusing on CWE categories such as CWE-190 (Integer Overflow or Wraparound) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). We also tracked the lifecycle of these vulnerabilities across software versions. This approach allows us to systematically analyze vulnerabilities in projects, which has not been extensively explored in previous ADS research. Our analysis revealed that specific CWE categories, particularly CWE-190 (59.6%) and CWE-20 (16.1%), were prevalent across the selected ADS projects. These vulnerabilities often persisted for over six months, spanning multiple version iterations. The empirical assessment showed a direct link between the severity of these vulnerabilities and their tangible effects on ADS performance. These security issues among ADS still remain to be resolved. Our findings highlight the need for integrating static code analysis into ADS development to detect and mitigate common vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>SAP-DIFF: Semantic Adversarial Patch Generation for Black-Box Face Recognition Models via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the need to evaluate the robustness of face recognition (FR) models, many efforts have focused on adversarial patch attacks that mislead FR models by introducing localized perturbations. Impersonation attacks are a significant threat because adversarial perturbations allow attackers to disguise themselves as legitimate users. This can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, system damage, and misuse of resources. However, research on such attacks in FR remains limited. Existing adversarial patch generation methods exhibit limited efficacy in impersonation attacks due to (1) the need for high attacker capabilities, (2) low attack success rates, and (3) excessive query requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method SAP-DIFF that leverages diffusion models to generate adversarial patches via semantic perturbations in the latent space rather than direct pixel manipulation. We introduce an attention disruption mechanism to generate features unrelated to the original face, facilitating the creation of adversarial samples and a directional loss function to guide perturbations toward the target identity feature space, thereby enhancing attack effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on popular FR models and datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average attack success rate improvement of 45.66% (all exceeding 40%), and a reduction in the number of queries by about 40% compared to the SOTA approach</description>

      <title>Snowball Adversarial Attack on Traffic Sign Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on machine learning models often rely on small, imperceptible perturbations to mislead classifiers. Such strategy focuses on minimizing the visual perturbation for humans so they are not confused, and also maximizing the misclassification for machine learning algorithms. An orthogonal strategy for adversarial attacks is to create perturbations that are clearly visible but do not confuse humans, yet still maximize misclassification for machine learning algorithms. This work follows the later strategy, and demonstrates instance of it through the Snowball Adversarial Attack in the context of traffic sign recognition. The attack leverages the human brain's superior ability to recognize objects despite various occlusions, while machine learning algorithms are easily confused. The evaluation shows that the Snowball Adversarial Attack is robust across various images and is able to confuse state-of-the-art traffic sign recognition algorithm. The findings reveal that Snowball Adversarial Attack can significantly degrade model performance with minimal effort, raising important concerns about the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and highlighting the necessity for improved defenses for image recognition machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Differentially-private frugal estimation of quantiles</title>

Abstract: Fast and accurate estimation of quantiles on data streams coming from communication networks, Internet of Things (IoT), and alike, is at the heart of important data processing applications including statistical analysis, latency monitoring, query optimization for parallel database management systems, and more. Indeed, quantiles are more robust indicators for the underlying distribution, compared to moment-based indicators such as mean and variance. The streaming setting additionally constrains accurate tracking of quantiles, as stream items may arrive at a very high rate and must be processed as quickly as possible and discarded, being their storage usually unfeasible. Since an exact solution is only possible when data are fully stored, the goal in practical contexts is to provide an approximate solution with a provably guaranteed bound on the approximation error committed, while using a minimal amount of space. At the same time, with the increasing amount of personal and sensitive information exchanged, it is essential to design privacy protection techniques to ensure confidentiality and data integrity. In this paper we present the following differentially private streaming algorithms for frugal estimation of a quantile: DP-FRUGAL-1U-L, DP-FRUGAL-1U-G, DP-FRUGAL-1U-\r{ho} and DP-FRUGAL-2U-SA. Frugality refers to the ability of the algorithms to provide a good approximation to the sought quantile using a modest amount of space, either one or two units of memory. We provide a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results, in which we also compare DP-FRUGAL-1U-L with LDPQ, a recent state of the art algorithm, and show that DP-FRUGAL-1U-L outperforms LDPQ in both accuracy and speed.</description>

      <title>DIN-CTS: Low-Complexity Depthwise-Inception Neural Network with Contrastive Training Strategy for Deepfake Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for deepfake speech detection (DSD) based on a lowcomplexity Depthwise-Inception Network (DIN) trained with a contrastive training strategy (CTS). In this framework, input audio recordings are first transformed into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Linear Filter (LF), which are then used to train the DIN. Once trained, the DIN processes bonafide utterances to extract audio embeddings, which are used to construct a Gaussian distribution representing genuine speech. Deepfake detection is then performed by computing the distance between a test utterance and this distribution to determine whether the utterance is fake or bonafide. To evaluate our proposed systems, we conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset of ASVspoof 2019 LA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the Depthwise-Inception Network with the contrastive learning strategy in distinguishing between fake and bonafide utterances. We achieved Equal Error Rate (EER), Accuracy (Acc.), F1, AUC scores of 4.6%, 95.4%, 97.3%, and 98.9% respectively using a single, low-complexity DIN with just 1.77 M parameters and 985 M FLOPS on short audio segments (4 seconds). Furthermore, our proposed system outperforms the single-system submissions in the ASVspoof 2019 LA challenge, showcasing its potential for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>FederBoost: Private Federated Learning for GBDT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been an emerging trend in machine learning and artificial intelligence. It allows multiple participants to collaboratively train a better global model and offers a privacy-aware paradigm for model training since it does not require participants to release their original training data. However, existing FL solutions for vertically partitioned data or decision trees require heavy cryptographic operations. In this paper, we propose a framework named FederBoost for private federated learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). It supports running GBDT over both vertically and horizontally partitioned data. Vertical FederBoost does not require any cryptographic operation and horizontal FederBoost only requires lightweight secure aggregation. The key observation is that the whole training process of GBDT relies on the ordering of the data instead of the values. We fully implement FederBoost and evaluate its utility and efficiency through extensive experiments performed on three public datasets. Our experimental results show that both vertical and horizontal FederBoost achieve the same level of accuracy with centralized training where all data are collected in a central server, and they are 4-5 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art solutions for federated decision tree training; hence offering practical solutions for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Demystifying RCE Vulnerabilities in LLM-Integrated Apps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs show promise in transforming software development, with a growing interest in integrating them into more intelligent apps. Frameworks like LangChain aid LLM-integrated app development, offering code execution utility/APIs for custom actions. However, these capabilities theoretically introduce Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, enabling remote code execution through prompt injections. No prior research systematically investigates these frameworks' RCE vulnerabilities or their impact on applications and exploitation consequences. Therefore, there is a huge research gap in this field. In this study, we propose LLMSmith to detect, validate and exploit the RCE vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated frameworks and apps. To achieve this goal, we develop two novel techniques, including 1) a lightweight static analysis to examine LLM integration mechanisms, and construct call chains to identify RCE vulnerabilities in frameworks; 2) a systematical prompt-based exploitation method to verify and exploit the found vulnerabilities in LLM-integrated apps. This technique involves various strategies to control LLM outputs, trigger RCE vulnerabilities and launch subsequent attacks. Our research has uncovered a total of 20 vulnerabilities in 11 LLM-integrated frameworks, comprising 19 RCE vulnerabilities and 1 arbitrary file read/write vulnerability. Of these, 17 have been confirmed by the framework developers, with 11 vulnerabilities being assigned CVE IDs. For the 51 apps potentially affected by RCE, we successfully executed attacks on 17 apps, 16 of which are vulnerable to RCE and 1 to SQL injection. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities and construct practical attacks to demonstrate the hazards in reality. Last, we propose several mitigation measures for both framework and app developers to counteract such attacks.</description>

      <title>FBChain: A Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model with Efficiency and Secure Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy and security in the parameter transmission process of federated learning are currently among the most prominent concerns. However, there are two thorny problems caused by unprotected communication methods: "parameter-leakage" and "inefficient-communication". This article proposes Blockchain-based Federated Learning (FBChain) model for federated learning parameter communication to overcome the above two problems. First, we utilize the immutability of blockchain to store the global model and hash value of local model parameters in case of tampering during the communication process, protect data privacy by encrypting parameters, and verify data consistency by comparing the hash values of local parameters, thus addressing the "parameter-leakage" problem. Second, the Proof of Weighted Link Speed (PoWLS) consensus algorithm comprehensively selects nodes with the higher weighted link speed to aggregate global model and package blocks, thereby solving the "inefficient-communication" problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FBChain model and its ability to improve model communication efficiency in federated learning.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy AI-Generative Content for Intelligent Network Service: Robustness, Security, and Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) models, represented by large language models (LLM), have revolutionized content creation. High-speed next-generation communication technology is an ideal platform for providing powerful AIGC network services. At the same time, advanced AIGC techniques can also make future network services more intelligent, especially various online content generation services. However, the significant untrustworthiness concerns of current AIGC models, such as robustness, security, and fairness, greatly affect the credibility of intelligent network services, especially in ensuring secure AIGC services. This paper proposes TrustGAIN, a trustworthy AIGC framework that incorporates robust, secure, and fair network services. We first discuss the robustness to adversarial attacks faced by AIGC models in network systems and the corresponding protection issues. Subsequently, we emphasize the importance of avoiding unsafe and illegal services and ensuring the fairness of the AIGC network services. Then as a case study, we propose a novel sentiment analysis-based detection method to guide the robust detection of unsafe content in network services. We conduct our experiments on fake news, malicious code, and unsafe review datasets to represent LLM application scenarios. Our results indicate that TrustGAIN is an exploration of future networks that can support trustworthy AIGC network services.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch Theorem for Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individuals and businesses have been significantly benefited by Large Language Models (LLMs) including PaLM, Gemini and ChatGPT in various ways. For example, LLMs enhance productivity, reduce costs, and enable us to focus on more valuable tasks. Furthermore, LLMs possess the capacity to sift through extensive datasets, uncover underlying patterns, and furnish critical insights that propel the frontiers of technology and science. However, LLMs also pose privacy concerns. Users' interactions with LLMs may expose their sensitive personal or company information. A lack of robust privacy safeguards and legal frameworks could permit the unwarranted intrusion or improper handling of individual data, thereby risking infringements of privacy and the theft of personal identities. To ensure privacy, it is essential to minimize the dependency between shared prompts and private information. Various randomization approaches have been proposed to protect prompts' privacy, but they may incur utility loss compared to unprotected LLMs prompting. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the balance between the risk of privacy leakage and loss of utility when conducting effective protection mechanisms. The current study develops a framework for inferring privacy-protected Large Language Models (LLMs) and lays down a solid theoretical basis for examining the interplay between privacy preservation and utility. The core insight is encapsulated within a theorem that is called as the NFL (abbreviation of the word No-Free-Lunch) Theorem.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Backdoor Effect for Multi-Task Model Merging via Safety-Aware Subspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model merging has gained significant attention as a cost-effective approach to integrate multiple single-task fine-tuned models into a unified one that can perform well on multiple tasks. However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/Yangjinluan/DAM.</description>

      <title>Consensus Under Adversary Majority Done Right</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A specter is haunting consensus protocols -- the specter of adversary majority. Dolev and Strong in 1983 showed an early possibility for up to 99% adversaries. Yet, other works show impossibility results for adversaries above 50% under synchrony, seemingly the same setting as Dolev and Strong's. What gives? It is high time that we pinpoint a key culprit for this ostensible contradiction: the modeling details of clients. Are the clients sleepy or always-on? Are they silent or communicating? Can validators be sleepy too? We systematize models for consensus across four dimensions (sleepy/always-on clients, silent/communicating clients, sleepy/always-on validators, and synchrony/partial-synchrony), some of which are new, and tightly characterize the achievable safety and liveness resiliences with matching possibilities and impossibilities for each of the sixteen models. To this end, we unify folklore and earlier results, and fill gaps left in the literature with new protocols and impossibility theorems.</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Data Generation in Small Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose $\mathtt{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator with \textit{differential privacy} guarantees. $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses a novel hierarchical decomposition that approximates the input's cumulative distribution function (CDF) in bounded memory. It balances hierarchy depth, noise addition, and pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving frequent ones. Private sketches estimate subdomain frequencies efficiently without full data access.
  A key feature is the pruning parameter $k$, which controls the trade-off between space and utility. We define the skew measure $\mathtt{tail}_k$, capturing all but the top $k$ subdomain frequencies. Given a dataset $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses $M=\mathcal{O}(k\log^2 |X|)$ space and, for input domain $\Omega = [0,1]$, ensures $\varepsilon$-differential privacy. It yields a generator with expected Wasserstein distance: \[ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log^2 M}{\varepsilon n} + \frac{||\mathtt{tail}_k(\mathcal{X})||_1}{M n}\right) \] from the empirical distribution. This parameterized trade-off offers a level of flexibility unavailable in prior work. We also provide interpretable utility bounds that account for hierarchy depth, privacy noise, pruning, and frequency estimation errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every commercially available, state-of-the-art neural network consume plain input data, which is a well-known privacy concern. We propose a new architecture based on homomorphic encryption, which allows the neural network to operate on encrypted data. We show that Homomorphic Neural Networks (HNN) can achieve full privacy and security while maintaining levels of accuracy comparable to plain neural networks. We also introduce a new layer, the Differentiable Soft-Argmax, which allows the calibration of output logits in the encrypted domain, raising the entropy of the activation parameters, thus improving the security of the model, while keeping the overall noise below the acceptable noise budget. Experiments were conducted using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) corpora on the DistilBERT base uncased finetuned SST-2 English sentiment analysis model, and the results show that the HNN model can achieve up to 82.5% of the accuracy of the plain model while maintaining full privacy and security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Webshell is a type of backdoor, and web applications are widely exposed to webshell injection attacks. Therefore, it is important to study webshell detection techniques. In this study, we propose a webshell detection method. We first convert PHP source code to opcodes and then extract Opcode Double-Tuples (ODTs). Next, we combine CodeBert and FastText models for feature representation and classification. To address the challenge that deep learning methods have difficulty detecting long webshell files, we introduce a sliding window attention mechanism. This approach effectively captures malicious behavior within long files. Experimental results show that our method reaches high accuracy in webshell detection, solving the problem of traditional methods that struggle to address new webshell variants and anti-detection techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We first formalize rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Next, we prove that although small transformers can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can still mislead both theoretical constructions and models learned from data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that popular attack algorithms on LLMs find adversarial prompts and induce attention patterns that align with our theory. Our novel logic-based framework provides a foundation for studying LLMs in rule-based settings, enabling a formal analysis of tasks like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</description>

Abstract: Recently, various types of Text-to-Image (T2I) models have emerged (such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion), and showing their advantages in different aspects. Therefore, some third-party service platforms collect different model interfaces and provide cheaper API services and more flexibility in T2I model selections. However, this also raises a new security concern: Are these third-party services truly offering the models they claim?
  To answer this question, we first define the concept of T2I model verification, which aims to determine whether a black-box target model is identical to a given white-box reference T2I model. After that, we propose VerifyPrompt, which performs T2I model verification through a special designed verify prompt. Intuitionally, the verify prompt is an adversarial prompt for the target model without transferability for other models. It makes the target model generate a specific image while making other models produce entirely different images. Specifically, VerifyPrompt utilizes the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize the cosine similarity of a prompt's text encoding, generating verify prompts. Finally, by computing the CLIP-text similarity scores between the prompts the generated images, VerifyPrompt can determine whether the target model aligns with the reference model. Experimental results demonstrate that VerifyPrompt consistently achieves over 90\% accuracy across various T2I models, confirming its effectiveness in practical model platforms (such as Hugging Face).</description>
