      <title>A Novel Apparatus For Particle-Particle Single Contact Electrification Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experiment of a single contact between two sub-centimeter high-speed particles is often difficult to execute, especially if the collision must be physically and electrically isolated, as is the case for triboelectrification studies. Apparatuses designed for this type of experiment fall short of providing high-speed isolated collisions with a high probability of contact. In this article, we propose a novel apparatus that combines pneumatic conveying and acoustic levitation to provide an electrically and physically isolated, high impact speed collision between two sub-centimeter particles with a collision success rate of 93 %. We can control the pre-contact charge, material, and size of both particles, and the impact speed and angle. Test results show that charge transfer between two insulator particles is not solely driven by contact potential difference; it is a stochastic process that requires large datasets to resolve and understand. Our new apparatus can efficiently generate these datasets and provide new insights on the stochastic nature of charge transfer, and the effect of each of the collision parameters mentioned earlier on particle-particle charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Development of a Modular ODMR Setup for Optical Experiments in a Variable Temperature Insert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed an optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) setup designed for compatibility with a widely used, commercially available helium bath cryostat equipped with a variable temperature insert. The optical path extends nearly two meters, spanning the full length of the cryostat insert, enabling excitation of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and detection of the resulting fluorescence from outside the cryostat. The setup preserves optical alignment and beam quality along this extended path allowing integration into existing cryogenic systems without significant modifications. We demonstrate the setup's performance by measuring the temperature dependence of the resonance signal and its behavior under small applied magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic transition of a SrRuO$_3$ sample, thereby showcasing the feasibility of NV magnetometry on a sample in constrained cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>CryoDE: a Digital Cryogenic Detector Emulator for Microwave SQUID Multiplexed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous readout of large-scale cryogenic detector arrays relies on multiplexing schemes such as the FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) with microwave SQUID multiplexers and highly customized readout electronics. In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of a 96-channel Resistive Micromegas Detector for ENUBET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PICOSEC-Micromegas (PICOSEC-MM) detector is a fast gaseous detector that achieves picosecond-level timing by coupling a Cherenkov radiator, typically an MgF2 crystal, to a Micromegas-based photodetector with a photocathode. This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project. It employs a 2.5 nm diamond-like carbon photocathode and a Micromegas board with a surface resistivity of 10 megaohms per square, and was characterized using 150 GeV/c muons at the CERN SPS beamline, with one-third of the active area instrumented per run. A dedicated alignment procedure for multi-pad PICOSEC-MM systems was used to reconstruct pad centers and merge measurements across regions, yielding a timing resolution of 43 ps and uniform signal arrival time distributions over the tested area. Mechanical flatness was identified as a key factor, with planarity tolerances within 10 micrometers required to maintain good timing resolution, and the successful operation of the 96-pad demonstrator confirms the scalability of the PICOSEC-MM concept toward robust, high-granularity, picosecond-level gaseous timing detectors for monitored neutrino beam experiments such as ENUBET.</description>

      <title>Construction and characterization of a seven-chip GridPix X-ray detector for solar axion searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scope of solar axion searches, detectors which are able to measure low energetic X-rays with high efficiency are required. For this purpose a detector based on the GridPix technology was built for the CAST experiment at CERN. The GridPix is a pixelised readout ASIC (Timepix) with a Micromegas-like gas amplification stage (grid) built photolithographically on top. In order to reduce the detector's background level, several hardware and software vetoes were implemented.
  Hardware-wise, these vetoes consist of a ring of six GridPixes around a central GridPix, a readout of the induced grid signal, and two scintillators. On the software side, multiple approaches to distinguish between background events and X-ray photons are implemented. Here, also the hardware features, like the six surrounding GridPixes, are used.
  The new detector was tested in a long ($3500\,\text{h}$) background data taking campaign. The performance of the new vetoes was evaluated. The detector performance itself, for low energetic X-rays, was also evaluated with a variable X-ray generator using eight different energies from 0 to $10\,\text{keV}$. The efficiency for very low energetic X-rays and the energy resolution was determined.</description>

      <title>Finding the Maximal Contrast of Two Elliptical Gaussian Mode Beams with Aligned Ellipticities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric contrast is a key factor limiting the sensitivity of precision optical measurements, including the laser interferometers used in gravitational-wave detection. While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations. This work provides a practical tool for modeling and optimizing elliptical-beam interferometers.</description>

      <title>Off-line Commissioning of the St. Benedict Radiofrequency Quadrupole Cooler-Buncher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The St. Benedict ion trapping system, which aims to measure the $\beta-\nu$ angular correlation parameter in superallowed-mixed mirror transitions, is under construction at the University of Notre Dame. These measurements will provide much-needed data to improve the accuracy of the $V_{ud}$ element of the CKM matrix. One of the major components of this system is the radio frequency quadrupole cooler-buncher, which is necessary to create low-emittance ion bunches for injection into the measurement Paul trap. The off-line commissioning of the cooler-buncher, using a potassium ion source, determined that the device could produce cooled ion bunches characterized by a 50-ns full-width-half-maximum time width. The commissioning results also determined the trapping efficiency to be 93(1)$\%$ and the trapping half-life to be 20.0(5) s.</description>

      <title>Data-driven optimization of pixelated CdZnTe spectrometers for uranium enrichment assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work [Vavrek et al. (2025)], we developed the performance optimization framework spectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable performance across many readout channels. The framework uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and clustering to learn groups of similarly-performing channels and sweep through various learned channel combinations to optimize the performance tradeoff of including worse-performing channels for better total efficiency. In this work, we integrate the pyGEM uranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the U-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization target. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a 30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400 CdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive assay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts. Additionally, this work demonstrates that the spectre-ml optimization framework can accommodate arbitrary end-user spectroscopic analysis code and performance metrics, enabling future optimizations for complex Pu spectra.</description>
