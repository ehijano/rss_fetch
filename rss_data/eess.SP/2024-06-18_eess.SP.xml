      <title>Channel Twinning: An Enabler for Next-Generation Ubiquitous Wireless Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging concept of channel twinning (CT) has great potential to become a key enabler of ubiquitous connectivity in next-generation (xG) wireless systems. By fusing multimodal sensor data, CT advocates a high-fidelity and low-overhead channel acquisition paradigm, which is promising to provide accurate channel prediction in cross-domain and high-mobility scenarios of ubiquitous xG networks. However, the current literature lacks a universal CT architecture to address the challenges of heterogeneous scenarios, data, and resources in xG networks, which hinders the widespread deployment and applications of CT. This article discusses a new modularized CT architecture to bridge the barriers to scene recognition, cooperative sensing, and decentralized training. Based on the modularized design of CT, universal channel modeling, multimodal cooperative sensing, and lightweight twin modeling are described. Moreover, this article provides a concise definition, technical features, and case studies of CT, followed by potential applications of CT-empowered ubiquitous connectivity and some issues requiring future investigations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for Near-Field ISAC with Modular XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel modular extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed in this paper. We consider a downlink ISAC scenario and exploit the modular array architecture to enhance the communication spectral efficiency and sensing resolution while reducing the channel modeling complexity by employing the hybrid spherical and planar wavefront model. Considering the hybrid digital-analog structure inherent to modular arrays, we formulate a joint analog-digital beamforming design problem based on the communication spectral efficiency and sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR). By exploring the structural similarity of the communication and sensing channels, it is proved that the optimal transmit covariance matrix lies in the subspace spanned by the subarray response vectors, yielding a closed-form solution for the optimal analog beamformer. Consequently, the joint design problem is transformed into a low-dimensional rank-constrained digital beamformer optimization. We first propose a manifold optimization method that directly optimizes the digital beamformer on the rank-constrained Stiefel manifold. Additionally, we develop an semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based approach that relaxes the rank constraint and employ the randomization technique to obtain a near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modular XL-MIMO ISAC framework and algorithms.</description>

      <title>MSE Minimization in RIS-Aided MU-MIMO with Discrete Phase Shifts and Fronthaul Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and study the precoding and RIS configuration design under practical system constraints. These constraints include the limited-capacity fronthaul at the transmitter side and the finite resolution of RIS elements. We investigate the sum mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem and propose an algorithm based on the block coordinate descent method to optimize the precoding, RIS configuration, and receiver gains. We compute the precoding vectors and RIS configuration using the Schnorr-Euchner sphere decoding (SESD) method which delivers the optimal MSE-minimizing solution. We numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed SESD-based methods and corroborate their effectiveness in improving the system performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of cardiorespiratory auscultation sensing devices which is useful for understanding the theoretical aspects of sensing devices, as well as practical notes to design novel sensing devices. One of the methods to design a stethoscope is using electret condenser microphones (ECM). In this paper, we first introduce the acoustic properties of the heart and lungs, as well as a brief history of stethoscope evolution. Then, we discuss the basic concept of ECM sensors and a recent stethoscope based on this technology. In response to the limitations of ECM-based systems, we explore the potential of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), particularly focusing on piezoelectric transducer (PZT) sensors. This paper comprehensively reviews sensing technologies, emphasizing innovative MEMS-based designs for wearable cardiopulmonary auscultation in the past decade. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to summarize ECM and MEMS applications for heart and lung sound analysis.

      <title>Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D &gt; 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Near-Field: Far-Field Location Division Multiple Access in Downlink MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring channel dimensions has been the driving force behind breakthroughs in successive generations of mobile communication systems. In 5G, space division multiple access (SDMA) leveraging massive MIMO has been crucial in enhancing system capacity through spatial differentiation of users. However, SDMA can only finely distinguish users at adjacent angles in ultra-dense networks by extremely large-scale antenna arrays. For a long time, most research has focused on the angle domain of the space, overlooking the potential of the distance domain. Near-field location division multiple access (LDMA) was proposed based on the beam-focusing effect yielded by near-field spherical propagation model, partitioning channel resources by both angle and distance. To achieve a similar idea in the far-field region, this paper introduces a far-field LDMA scheme for wideband systems based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Benefiting from frequency diverse arrays (FDA), it becomes possible to manipulate beams in the distance domain. Combined with OFDM, the inherent cyclic prefix ensures a complete OFDM symbol can be received without losing distance information, while the matched filter of OFDM helps eliminate the time-variance of FDA steering vectors. Theoretical and simulation results show that LDMA can fully exploit the additional degrees of freedom in the distance domain to significantly improve spectral efficiency, especially in narrow sector multiple access (MA) scenarios. Moreover, LDMA can maintain independence between array elements even in single-path channels, making it stand out in MA schemes at millimeter-wave and higher frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Non-Line-of-Sight Integrated Sensing and Communication at mmWave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One rarely addressed direction in the context of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing, with the potential to enable use cases like intrusion detection and to increase the value that wireless networks can bring. However, ISAC networks impose challenges for sensing due to their communication-oriented design. For instance, time division duplex transmission creates spectral holes in time, resulting in spectral replicas in the radar image. To counteract this, we evaluate different channel state information processing strategies and discuss their tradeoffs. We further propose an ensemble of techniques to detect targets in NLOS conditions. Our approaches are validated with experiments using a millimeter wave ISAC proof of concept in a factory-like environment. The results show that target detection in NLOS is generally possible with ISAC.</description>

      <title>Initial Investigation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as Feature Extractors for IMU Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of a novel neural network architecture, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as feature extractors for sensor-based (specifically IMU) Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Where conventional networks perform a parameterized weighted sum of the inputs at each node and then feed the result into a statically defined nonlinearity, KANs perform non-linear computations represented by B-SPLINES on the edges leading to each node and then just sum up the inputs at the node. Instead of learning weights, the system learns the spline parameters. In the original work, such networks have been shown to be able to more efficiently and exactly learn sophisticated real valued functions e.g. in regression or PDE solution. We hypothesize that such an ability is also advantageous for computing low-level features for IMU-based HAR. To this end, we have implemented KAN as the feature extraction architecture for IMU-based human activity recognition tasks, including four architecture variations. We present an initial performance investigation of the KAN feature extractor on four public HAR datasets. It shows that the KAN-based feature extractor outperforms CNN-based extractors on all datasets while being more parameter efficient.</description>

      <title>Interpretable modulated differentiable STFT and physics-informed balanced spectrum metric for freight train wheelset bearing cross-machine transfer fault diagnosis under speed fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The service conditions of wheelset bearings has a direct impact on the safe operation of railway heavy haul freight trains as the key components. However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.</description>

      <title>Hacking Encrypted Wireless Power: Cyber-Security of Dynamic Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, energy encryption for wireless power transfer has been developed for energy safety, which is important in public places to suppress unauthorized energy extraction. Most techniques vary the frequency so that unauthorized receivers cannot extract energy because of non-resonance. However, this strategy is unreliable. To stimulate the progress of energy encryption technology and point out security holes, this paper proposes a decryption method for the fundamental principle of encrypted frequency-varying wireless power transfer. The paper uses an auxiliary coil to detect the frequency and a switched-capacitor array to adaptively compensate the receiver for a wide frequency range. The switched-capacitor array contains two capacitors and one semi-conductor switch. One capacitor compensates the receiver all the time while the other's active time during one wireless power transfer cycle is regulated by the switch. Thus, the proposed hacking receiver controls the equivalent capacitance of the compensation and steals energy. Finally, a detailed simulation model and experimental results prove the effectiveness of the attack on frequency-hopping energy encryption. Although any nonnegligible energy extracted would be problematic, we achieved to steal 78% to 84% of the energy an authorized receiver could get. When the frequency changes, the interceptor is coarsely tuned very quickly, which can hack fast frequency-varying encrypted system.</description>

      <title>Binaural Selective Attention Model for Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of humans to selectively focus on a target speaker in cocktail party scenarios is facilitated by binaural audio processing. In this paper, we present a binaural time-domain Target Speaker Extraction model based on the Filter-and-Sum Network (FaSNet). Inspired by human selective hearing, our proposed model introduces target speaker embedding into separators using a multi-head attention-based selective attention block. We also compared two binaural interaction approaches -- the cosine similarity of time-domain signals and inter-channel correlation in learned spectral representations. Our experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms monaural configurations and state-of-the-art multi-channel target speaker extraction models, achieving best-in-class performance with 18.52 dB SI-SDR, 19.12 dB SDR, and 3.05 PESQ scores under anechoic two-speaker test configurations.</description>

      <title>Sparse MIMO for ISAC: New Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been a key technology of wireless communications for decades. A typical MIMO system employs antenna arrays with the inter-antenna spacing being half of the signal wavelength, which we term as compact MIMO. Looking forward towards the future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, MIMO system will achieve even finer spatial resolution to not only enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless communications, but also enable more accurate wireless sensing. To this end, by removing the restriction of half-wavelength antenna spacing, sparse MIMO has been proposed as a new architecture that is able to significantly enlarge the array aperture as compared to conventional compact MIMO with the same number of array elements. In addition, sparse MIMO leads to a new form of virtual MIMO systems for sensing with their virtual apertures considerably larger than physical apertures. As sparse MIMO is expected to be a viable technology for 6G, we provide in this article a comprehensive overview of it, especially focusing on its appealing advantages for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) towards 6G. Specifically, assorted sparse MIMO architectures are first introduced, followed by their new benefits as well as challenges. We then discuss the main design issues of sparse MIMO, including beam pattern synthesis, signal processing, grating lobe suppression, beam codebook design, and array geometry optimization. Last, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of sparse MIMO for ISAC and point out promising directions for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the important performance metrics like effective capacity and symbol error rate over fluctuating Nakagami-m fading channel. This distribution is obtained from the ratio of two random variables, following the Nakagami-m distribution and the uniform distribution. Our study derives exact analytical expressions for the EC and SER under different modulation schemes, considering the effect of channel parameters. Recognising the importance of additive Laplacian noise in today scenario, it has been considered for the error performance analysis of the system. This work may be utilised for the design and optimization of the systems operating in environments characterized by fluctuating Nakagami-m fading.</description>

      <title>Multi-Active-IRS-Assisted Cooperative Sensing: Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound and Joint Beamforming Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted cooperative sensing, in which multiple active IRSs are deployed in a distributed manner to facilitate multi-view target sensing at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the base station (BS). Different from prior works employing passive IRSs, we leverage active IRSs with the capability of amplifying the reflected signals to overcome the severe multi-hop-reflection path loss in NLoS sensing. In particular, we consider two sensing setups without and with dedicated sensors equipped at active IRSs. In the first case without dedicated sensors at IRSs, we investigate the cooperative sensing at the BS, where the target's direction-of-arrival (DoA) with respect to each IRS is estimated based on the echo signals received at the BS. In the other case with dedicated sensors at IRSs, we consider that each IRS is able to receive echo signals and estimate the target's DoA with respect to itself. For both sensing setups, we first derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating target DoA. Then, the (maximum) CRB is minimized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the multiple IRSs, subject to the constraints on the maximum transmit power at the BS, as well as the maximum amplification power and the maximum power amplification gain constraints at individual active IRSs. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex (max-)CRB minimization problems, we propose two efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the two cases with sensing at the BS and at the IRSs, respectively, based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and semi-definite relaxation.</description>

      <title>Speak in the Scene: Diffusion-based Acoustic Scene Transfer toward Immersive Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel task in generative speech processing, Acoustic Scene Transfer (AST), which aims to transfer acoustic scenes of speech signals to diverse environments. AST promises an immersive experience in speech perception by adapting the acoustic scene behind speech signals to desired environments. We propose AST-LDM for the AST task, which generates speech signals accompanied by the target acoustic scene of the reference prompt. Specifically, AST-LDM is a latent diffusion model conditioned by CLAP embeddings that describe target acoustic scenes in either audio or text modalities. The contributions of this paper include introducing the AST task and implementing its baseline model. For AST-LDM, we emphasize its core framework, which is to preserve the input speech and generate audio consistently with both the given speech and the target acoustic environment. Experiments, including objective and subjective tests, validate the feasibility and efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Integrating Pre-trained Speech Enhancement and Recognition Models for Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise robustness is critical when applying automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world scenarios. One solution involves the used of speech enhancement (SE) models as the front end of ASR. However, neural network-based (NN-based) SE often introduces artifacts into the enhanced signals and harms ASR performance, particularly when SE and ASR are independently trained. Therefore, this study introduces a simple yet effective SE post-processing technique to address the gap between various pre-trained SE and ASR models. A bridge module, which is a lightweight NN, is proposed to evaluate the signal-level information of the speech signal. Subsequently, using the signal-level information, the observation addition technique is applied to effectively reduce the shortcomings of SE. The experimental results demonstrate the success of our method in integrating diverse pre-trained SE and ASR models, considerably boosting the ASR robustness. Crucially, no prior knowledge of the ASR or speech contents is required during the training or inference stages. Moreover, the effectiveness of this approach extends to different datasets without necessitating the fine-tuning of the bridge module, ensuring efficiency and improved generalization.</description>

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems can be utilized for kinematics decoding from scalp brain activation to control rehabilitation or power-augmenting devices. In this study, the hand kinematics decoding for grasp and lift task is performed in three-dimensional (3D) space using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Twelve subjects from the publicly available database WAY-EEG-GAL, has been utilized in this study. In particular, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) based deep learning frameworks are proposed that utilize the motor-neural information encoded in the pre-movement EEG data. Spectral features are analyzed for hand kinematics decoding using EEG data filtered in seven frequency ranges. The best performing frequency band spectral features has been considered for further analysis with different EEG window sizes and lag windows. Appropriate lag windows from movement onset, make the approach pre-movement in true sense. Additionally, inter-subject hand trajectory decoding analysis is performed using leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) approach. The Pearson correlation coefficient and hand trajectory are considered as performance metric to evaluate decoding performance for the neural decoders. This study explores the feasibility of inter-subject 3-D hand trajectory decoding using EEG signals only during reach and grasp task, probably for the first time. The results may provide the viable information to decode 3D hand kinematics using pre-movement EEG signals for practical BCI applications such as exoskeleton/exosuit and prosthesis.</description>

      <title>High-rate Reliable Communication using Multi-hop and Mesh THz/FSO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider multi-hop and mesh hybrid teraHertz/free-space optics (THz/FSO)-based backhaul networks for high data-rate communications. The results are presented for the cases with both out-band integrated access and backhaul (IAB) and non-IAB based communication setups. We consider different deployments of the THz and FSO networks and consider both switching and combining methods between the hybrid FSO/THz links. We study the impact of atmospheric turbulence, atmospheric attenuation, and the pointing error on the FSO communication. The THz communication suffers from small scale fading, path-loss, and the misalignment error. Finally, we evaluate the effects of atmospheric attenuation/path-loss, pointing/misalignment error, small-scale fading, atmospheric turbulence, number of antennas, number of user equipments, number of hops, and the threshold data-rates on the performance of considered systems. As we show, with different network deployments and switching/combining methods, the hybrid implementation of the THz/FSO links improves the network reliability significantly.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Aided Beamforming for Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the optimal beamformer design for the downlink of Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), mainly focusing on a two-user scenario. We derive novel closed-form expressions for the Bit Error Rate (BER) experienced by both users when Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is employed. Using these expressions, we formulate a fairness-based optimal beamforming problem aiming to minimize the maximum BER encountered by the users. Due to the complexity of this problem and the time-consuming nature of Constraint Optimization (CO) algorithms for real-time telecommunication systems, we propose a deep learning (DL) approach for its solution. The proposed DL architecture possesses specific input and output characteristics that enable the simultaneous training and use of the system by multiple different antenna schemes. By conducting extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing beamforming solutions and achieves BER performance close to that given by CO algorithms while significantly reducing the computational time needed. Finally, we conduct simulations to examine the robustness and efficiency of our system in different test scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present a non-contact respiratory anomaly detection method using incoherent light-wave signals reflected from the chest of a mechanical robot that can breathe like human beings. In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous infrared light source and sensor. This light-wave sensing system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range with an average classification accuracy of up to 96.6% using machine learning.</description>

Abstract: Satellite communication is one of the key technologies that is enabling next-generation networks. However, nearest-satellite-supported downlink transmission may not meet a user's requirements due to limited signal strength, especially in emergent scenarios. In this paper, we investigate a coordinated multi-satellite joint transmission system from a system-level perspective, where a user can be served by multiple satellites to improve its quality-of-service (QoS). Furthermore, we analyze the coverage and rate of a typical user in the joint transmission system. Simulation and numerical results show that the introduced system achieves a higher coverage probability than the traditional nearest-satellite-supported network. Moreover, a user's ergodic rate can be maximized by selecting an appropriate number of serving satellites.</description>

      <title>Wearable Technologies for Monitoring Upper Extremity Functions During Daily Life in Neurologically Impaired Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neurological disorders, including stroke, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease, generally lead to diminished upper extremity (UE) function, impacting individuals' independence and quality of life. Traditional assessments predominantly focus on standardized clinical tasks, offering limited insights into real-life UE performance. In this context, this review focuses on wearable technologies as a promising solution to monitor UE function in neurologically impaired individuals during daily life activities. Our primary objective is to categorize the different sensors, review the data collection and understand the employed data processing approaches. After screening over 1500 papers and including 21 studies, what comes to light is that the majority of them involved stroke survivors, and predominantly employed accelerometers or inertial measurement units to collect kinematics. Most analyses in these studies were performed offline, focusing on activity duration and frequency as key metrics. Although wearable technology shows potential in monitoring UE function in real-life scenarios, it also appears that a solution combining non-intrusiveness, lightweight design, detailed hand and finger movement capture, contextual information, extended recording duration, ease of use, and privacy protection remains an elusive goal. These are critical characteristics for a monitoring solution and researchers in the field should try to integrate the most in future developments. Last but not least, it stands out a growing necessity for a multimodal approach in capturing comprehensive data on UE function during real-life activities to enhance the personalization of rehabilitation strategies and ultimately improve outcomes for these individuals.</description>

      <title>A Geometry-based Stochastic Wireless Channel Model using Channel Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the high complexity of geometry-deterministic wireless channel modeling and the difficulty in its implementation, geometry-based stochastic channel modeling (GSCM) approaches have been used to evaluate wireless systems. This paper introduces a new method to model any GSCM by training a generative neural network based on images formed by channel parameters. Although generative neural networks are known to capture complicated data distributions, training with the raw data of channel parameters corresponding to a specific environment yields the increased complexity of the implementation. To overcome this issue, we process the channel parameters in the form of images and utilize them to train a generative model, which substantially reduces the complexity of implementation and training time. Furthermore, through a case study, we show that the generative model trained with our proposed data-to-image mapping method faithfully represents the distributions of the original data under general wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>EEG2Rep: Enhancing Self-supervised EEG Representation Through Informative Masked Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised approaches for electroencephalography (EEG) representation learning face three specific challenges inherent to EEG data: (1) The low signal-to-noise ratio which challenges the quality of the representation learned, (2) The wide range of amplitudes from very small to relatively large due to factors such as the inter-subject variability, risks the models to be dominated by higher amplitude ranges, and (3) The absence of explicit segmentation in the continuous-valued sequences which can result in less informative representations. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{EEG2Rep}, a self-prediction approach for self-supervised representation learning from EEG. Two core novel components of EEG2Rep are as follows: 1) Instead of learning to predict the masked input from raw EEG, EEG2Rep learns to predict masked input in latent representation space, and 2) Instead of conventional masking methods, EEG2Rep uses a new semantic subsequence preserving (SSP) method which provides informative masked inputs to guide EEG2Rep to generate rich semantic representations. In experiments on 6 diverse EEG tasks with subject variability, EEG2Rep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We show that our semantic subsequence preserving improves the existing masking methods in self-prediction literature and find that preserving 50\% of EEG recordings will result in the most accurate results on all 6 tasks on average. Finally, we show that EEG2Rep is robust to noise addressing a significant challenge that exists in EEG data.

      <title>Near-field Beam Training with Sparse DFT Codebook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) has emerged as one promising technology to improve the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution of future sixth generation (6G) wireless systems.The upsurge in the antenna number antennas renders communication users more likely to be located in the near-field region, which requires a more accurate spherical (instead of planar) wavefront propagation modeling.This inevitably incurs unaffordable beam training overhead when performing a two-dimensional (2D) beam-search in both the angular and range domains.To address this issue, we first introduce a new sparse discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook, which exhibits the angular periodicity in the received beam pattern at the user, which motivates us to propose a three-phase beam training scheme.Specifically, in the first phase, we utilize the sparse DFT codebook for beam sweeping in an angular subspace and estimate candidate user angles according to the received beam pattern.Then, a central sub-array is activated to scan specific candidate angles for resolving the issue of angular ambiguity and identity the user angle.In the third phase, the polar-domain codebook is applied in the estimated angle to search the best effective range of the user.Finally, numerical results show that the proposed beam training scheme enabled by sparse DFT codebook achieves 98.67% reduction as compared with the exhaustive-search scheme, yet without compromising rate performance in the high signal-to-ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $&lt;1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A site-specific radio channel representation considers the surroundings of the communication system through the environment geometry, such as buildings, vegetation, and mobile objects including their material and surface properties. In this article, we focus on communication technologies for 5G and beyond that are increasingly able to exploit the specific environment geometry for both communication and sensing. We present methods for a site-specific radio channel representation that is spatially consistent, such that mobile transmitter and receveiver cause a correlated time-varying channel impulse response. When modelled as random, this channel impulse response has non-stationary statistical properties, i.e., a time-variant Doppler spectrum, power delay profile, K-factor and spatial correlation. A site-specific radio channel representation will enable research into emerging 5G and beyond technologies such as distributed multiple-input multiple-output systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, multi-band communication, and joint communication and sensing. These 5G and beyond technologies will be deployed for a wide range of environments, from dense urban areas to railways, road transportation, industrial automation, and unmanned aerial vehicles.</description>

      <title>ESI-GAL: EEG Source Imaging-based Kinematics Parameter Estimation for Grasp and Lift Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a couple of new time-frequency transforms, designed to adapt their scale to specific features of the analyzed function. Such an adaptation is implemented via so-called focus functions, which control the window scale as a function of the time variable, or the frequency variable. In this respect, these transforms are non-linear, which makes the analysis more complex than usual.Under appropriate assumptions, some norm control can be obtained for both transforms in L^2(R) spaces, which extend the classical continuous frame norm control and guarantees well-definedness on L^2. Given the non-linearity of the transforms, the existence of inverse transforms is not guaranteed anymore, and is an open question. However, the results of this paper represent a first step towards a more general theory.Besides mathematical results, some elementary examples of time and frequency focus functions are provided, which can serve as staring point for concrete applications.</description>

Abstract: With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communications for industrial internet of things (IIoT), this paper studies the use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise, in which the receiver has statistical channel state information (CSI). We first provide a theoretical analysis on the limitations of unipolar pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy levels, when no (statistical) CSI is available at the transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic approximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic detectors in the large array regime. Finally, we numerically validate it and discuss the outage probability of the system.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation: A Neural Network Approach</title>

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input-multi-output (MIMO) is now a reality with great potential for further improvement. We study full-duplex transmissions as an effective way to improve mmWave MIMO systems. Compared to half-duplex systems, full-duplex transmissions may offer higher data rates and lower latency. However, full-duplex transmission is hindered by self-interference (SI) at the receive antennas, and SI channel estimation becomes a crucial step to make the full-duplex systems feasible. In this paper, we address the problem of channel estimation in full-duplex mmWave MIMO systems using neural networks (NNs). Our approach involves sharing pilot resources between user equipments (UEs) and transmit antennas at the base station (BS), aiming to reduce the pilot overhead in full-duplex systems and to achieve a comparable level to that of a half-duplex system. Additionally, in the case of separate antenna configurations in a full-duplex BS, providing channel estimates of transmit antenna (TX) arrays to the downlink UEs poses another challenge, as the TX arrays are not capable of receiving pilot signals. To address this, we employ an NN to map the channel from the downlink UEs to the receive antenna (RX) arrays to the channel from the TX arrays to the downlink UEs. We further elaborate on how NNs perform the estimation with different architectures, (e.g., different numbers of hidden layers), the introduction of non-linear distortion (e.g., with a 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)), and different channel conditions (e.g., low-correlated and high-correlated channels). Our work provides novel insights into NN-based channel estimators.</description>

      <title>MEIT: Multi-Modal Electrocardiogram Instruction Tuning on Large Language Models for Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04945</link>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the primary non-invasive diagnostic tool for monitoring cardiac conditions and is crucial in assisting clinicians. Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is time-consuming and requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the first attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open-source LLMs using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT's results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality report generation, zero-shot capabilities, and resilience to signal perturbation. These findings emphasize the efficacy of our MEIT framework and its potential for real-world clinical application.</description>
