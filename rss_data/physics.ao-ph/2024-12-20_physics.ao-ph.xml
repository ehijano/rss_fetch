      <title>CW3E's West-WRF 200-member Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 200-member ensemble developed at the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes based on the Weather Research and Forecast atmospheric model tailored for the prediction of atmospheric rivers and associated heavy-to-extreme precipitation events over the Western US (West-WRF) is presented. The ensemble (WW200En) is generated with initial and boundary conditions from the US National Center for Environmental Prediction's Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Ensemble Prediction System (EPS), 100 unique combinations of microphysics, planetary boundary layer, and cumulus schemes, as well as perturbations applied to each of the 200 members based on the stochastic kinetic-energy backscatter scheme. Each member is run with 9-km horizontal increments and 60 vertical levels for a 10-month period spanning two winters. The performance of WW200En is compared to GEFS and EPS for probabilistic forecasts of 24-h precipitation, integrated water vapor transport (IVT), and for several thresholds including high percentiles of the observed climatological distribution. The WW200En precipitation forecast skill is better than GEFS at nearly all thresholds and lead times, and comparable or better than the EPS. For larger rainfall thresholds WW200En typically exhibits the best forecast skill. Additionally, WW200En has a better spread-skill relationship than the global systems, and an improved overall reliability and resolution of the probabilistic prediction. The results for IVT are qualitatively similar to those for precipitation forecasts. A sensitivity analysis of the physics parameterizations and the number of ensemble members provides insights into possible future developments of WW200En.</description>

      <title>$^{7}Be$ a Cosmic Window into Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^{7}Be$ an isotope emanating from cosmogenic origins due to high energy cosmic rays, is studied from its production to its detection in the surface, in order to elucidate atmospheric circulation phenomena and analyze the vertical transport of air masses. This can be illustrated briefly by the monsoon model in Kerala in India, where the application of the $^{7}Be$ detection methods in stations in Russia and Australia offered predictions of the debut and retreat of moonsoon saison in contrast to the meteorological methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating Central England Temperature Variability: Statistical Analysis of Associations with North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the variability of the Central England Temperature (CET) series in relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) using advanced time series modeling techniques. Leveraging the world's longest continuous instrumental temperature dataset (1723-2023), this research applies ARIMA and ARIMAX models to quantify the impact of climatic oscillations on regional temperature variability, while also accounting for long-term warming trends. Spectral and coherence analyses further explore the periodic interactions between CET and the oscillations. Results reveal that NAO exerts a stronger influence on CET variability compared to PDO, with significant coherence observed at cycles of 5 to 7.5 years and 2 to 2.5 years for NAO, while PDO shows no statistically significant coherence. The ARIMAX model effectively captures both the upward warming trend and the influence of climatic oscillations, with robust diagnostics confirming its reliability. This study contributes to understanding the interplay between regional temperature variability and large-scale climatic drivers, providing a framework for future research on climatic oscillations and their role in shaping regional climate dynamics. Limitations and potential future directions, including the integration of additional climatic indices and comparative regional analyses, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Short-term wind forecasting via surface pressure measurements: stochastic modeling and sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a short-term wind forecasting framework for predicting real-time variations in atmospheric turbulence based on nacelle-mounted anemometer and ground-level air-pressure measurements. Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Downscaling Precipitation with Bias-informed Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is intensifying rainfall extremes, making high-resolution precipitation projections crucial for society to better prepare for impacts such as flooding. However, current Global Climate Models (GCMs) operate at spatial resolutions too coarse for localized analyses. To address this limitation, deep learning-based statistical downscaling methods offer promising solutions, providing high-resolution precipitation projections with a moderate computational cost. In this work, we introduce a bias-informed conditional diffusion model for statistical downscaling of precipitation. Specifically, our model leverages a conditional diffusion approach to learn distribution priors from large-scale, high-resolution precipitation datasets. The long-tail distribution of precipitation poses a unique challenge for training diffusion models; to address this, we apply gamma correction during preprocessing. Additionally, to correct biases in the downscaled results, we employ a guided-sampling strategy to enhance bias correction. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves highly accurate results in an 8 times downscaling setting, outperforming previous deterministic methods.

      <title>Influence of ICME-driven Magnetic Cloud-like and Sheath Region induced Geomagnetic Storms in causing anomalous responses of the Low-latitude Ionosphere: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows an anomalously enhanced response of the low-latitude ionosphere over the Indian sector under weak geomagnetic conditions (October 31, 2021) in comparison to a stronger event (November 04, 2021) under the influence of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME)-driven Magnetic Cloud (MC)-like and sheath regions respectively. The investigation is based on measurements of the Total Electron Content (TEC) from Ahmedabad (23.06$^\circ$N, 72.54$^\circ$E, geographic; dip angle: 35.20$^\circ$), a location near the northern crest of the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) over the Indian region. During the weaker event, the observed TEC from the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC), showed diurnal maximum enhancements of about 20 TECU over quiet-time variations, as compared to the stronger event where no such enhancements are present. It is shown that storm intensity (SYM-H) or magnitude of the southward Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) alone is unable to determine the ionospheric impacts of this space weather event. However, it is the non-fluctuating southward IMF and the corresponding penetration electric fields, for a sufficient interval of time, in tandem with the poleward neutral wind variations, that determines the strengthening of low-latitude electrodynamics of this anomalous event of October 31, 2021. Therefore, the present investigation highlights a case for further investigations of the important roles played by non-fluctuating penetration electric fields in determining a higher response of the low-latitude ionosphere even if the geomagnetic storm intensities are significantly low.</description>

      <title>Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI emulators for forecasting have emerged as powerful tools that can outperform conventional numerical predictions. The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remains stable, requiring further work.</description>
