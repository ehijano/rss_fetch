      <title>Semiregular abstract polyhedra with trivial facet stabilizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract polytopes generalize the face lattice of convex polytopes. An (abstract) polytope is semiregular if its facets are regular and its automorphism group acts transitively on its vertices. In this paper we construct semiregular, facet-transitive polyhedra with trivial facet stabilizer, showing that semiregular abstract polyhedra can have an unbounded number of flag orbits, while having as little as one facet orbit. We interpret this construction in terms of operations applied to high rank regular and chiral polytopes, and we see how this same operations help us construct alternating semiregular polyhedra. Finally, we give an idea to generalize this construction giving examples in higher ranks.</description>

      <title>On two conjectures of Shallit about Thue-Morse-like sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of infinite words $x_k$ , where $k$ is a positive integer, recently introduced by J. Shallit. This class includes the Thue-Morse sequence $x_1$, the Fibonacci-Thue-Morse sequence $x_2$, and the Allouche-Johnson sequence $x_3$. Shallit stated and for $k = 3$ proved two conjectures on properties of $x_k$. The first conjecture concerns the factor complexity, the second one the critical exponent of these words. We confirm the validity of both conjectures for every $k$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of spectra of digraph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between densities of cycles and the spectrum of a graphon, which implies that the spectra of convergent graphons converge, fundamentally relies on the self-adjointness of the linear operator associated with a graphon. In this short paper, we consider the setting of digraphons, which are limits of directed graphs, and prove that the spectra of convergent digraphons converge. Using this result, we establish the relation between densities of directed cycles and the spectrum of a digraphon.</description>

      <title>Remarks on $d$-ary partitions and an application to elementary symmetric partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new formulas for $p_d(n)$, the number of $d$-ary partitions of $n$, and, also, for its polynomial part. Given a partition $\lambda (\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_{\ell})$, its associated $j$-th symmetric elementary partition, $pre_{j}(\lambda)$, is the partition whose parts are $\{\lambda_{i_1}\cdots\lambda_{i_j}\;:\;1\leq i_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; i_j\leq \ell\}$. We prove that if $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are two $d$-ary partitions of length $\ell$ such that $pre_j(\lambda)=pre_j(\mu)$, then $\lambda=\mu$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic transitive graphs of small valency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $\Gamma$, the {\em distance} $d_\Gamma(u,v)$ between two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ in $\Gamma$ is defined as the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$, and the {\em diameter} $\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is the maximum distance between $u$ and $v$ for all vertices $u$ and $v$ in the vertex set of $\Gamma$. For a positive integer $s$, a path $(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{s})$ is called an {\em $s$-geodesic} if the distance of $u_0$ and $u_s$ is $s$. The graph $\Gamma$ is said to be {\em distance transitive} if for any vertices $u,v,x,y$ of $\Ga$ such that $d_\Ga(u,v)=d_\Ga(x,y)$, there exists an automorphism of $\Gamma$ that maps the pair $(u,v)$ to the pair $(x,y)$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ is said to be {\em geodesic transitive} if for each $i\leq \mathrm{diam}(\Ga)$, the full automorphism group acts transitively on the set of all $i$-geodesics. In the monograph [Distance-Regular Graphs, Section 7.5], the authors listed all distance transitive graphs of valency at most $13$. By using this classification, in this paper, we provide a complete classification of geodesic transitive graphs with valency at most $13$. As a result, there are exactly seven graphs of valency at most $13$ that are distance transitive but not geodesic transitive.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'{a}n problem of non-bipartite graphs: Forbidden books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A book graph $B_{r+1}$ is a set of $r+1$ triangles with a common edge, where $r\geq0$ is an integer. Zhai and Lin [J. Graph Theory 102 (2023) 502-520] proved that for $n\geq\frac{13}{2}r$, if $G$ is a $B_{r+1}$-free graph of order $n$, then $\rho(G)\leq\rho(T_{n,2})$, with equality if and only if $G\cong T_{n,2}$. Note that the extremal graph $T_{n,2}$ is bipartite. Motivated by the above elegant result, we investigate the spectral Tur\'{a}n problem of non-bipartite $B_{r+1}$-free graphs of order $n$. For general $r\geq1$, let $K_{\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor,\lceil\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil}^{r, r}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{\lceil\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil,\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor}$ by adding a new vertex $v_{0}$ such that $v_{0}$ has exactly $r$ neighbours in each part of $K_{\lceil\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil,\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor}$. By adopting a different technique named the residual index, Chv\'{a}tal-Hanson theorem and typical spectral extremal methods, we in this paper prove that: If $G$ is a non-bipartite $B_{r+1}$-free graph of order $n$, then $\rho(G)\leq\rho\Big(K_{\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor,\lceil\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil}^{r, r}\Big)$ , with equality if and only if $G\cong K_{\lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor,\lceil\frac{n-1}{2}\rceil}^{r, r}$. An interesting phenomenon is that the spectral extremal graphs are completely different for $r=0$ and general $r\geq1$.</description>

      <title>An improved bound for strongly regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue $-m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1979, Neumaier gave a bound on $\lambda$ in terms of $m$ and $\mu$, where $-m$ is the smallest eigenvalue of a primitive strongly regular graph, unless the graph in question belongs to one of the two infinite families of strongly regular graphs. We improve this result. We also indicate how our methods can be used to give an alternate derivation of Bruck's Completion Theorem for orthogonal arrays.</description>

      <title>Nim on Integer Partitions and Hyperrectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe PNim and RNim, two variants of Nim in which piles of tokens are replaced with integer partitions or hyperrectangles. In PNim, the players choose one of the integer partitions and remove a positive number of rows or a positive number of columns from the Young diagram of that partition. In RNim, players choose one of the hyperrectangles and reduce one of its side lengths.
  For PNim, we find a tight upper bound for the Sprague-Grundy values of partitions and characterize partitions with Sprague-Grundy value one. For RNim, we provide a formula for the Sprague-Grundy value of any position. We classify both games in the Conway-Gurvich-Ho hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Well-hued graphs with first difference two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be well-hued if every maximal $k$-colorable subgraph of $G$ has the same order $a_k$. Therefore, if $G$ is well-hued, we can associate with $G$ a sequence $\{a_k\}$. Necessary and sufficient conditions were given as to when a sequence $\{a_k\}$ is realized by a well-hued graph. Further, it was conjectured there is only one connected well-hued graph with $a_2 = a_1 + 2$ for every $a_1 \ge 4$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture as well as characterize nearly all well-hued graphs with $a_1=2$. We also investigate when both $G$ and its complement are well-hued.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions via orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: given $k \leq d/2$, does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)? Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proved the a.a.s. existence for every odd $k$ using earlier results regarding orientations satisfying certain degree conditions modulo $k$.
  In this paper we give a direct, self-contained proof that works for every $d$ and every $k&lt;d/2-1$. In fact, we prove stronger results. Let $s\geq 1$ denote the integer part of $d/(2k)$. We show that the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. has a $k$-star decomposition such that the number of stars centered at each vertex is either $s$ or $s+1$. Moreover, if $k &lt; d/3$ or $k \leq d/2 - 2.6 \log d$, we can even prescribe the set of vertices with $s$ stars, as long as it is of the appropriate size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milley and Renault proved an interesting characterisation of invertible elements in the dead-ending universe: they are the games with no subpositions of outcome $\mathscr{P}$ (the '$\mathscr{P}$-free' games). We generalise their approach to obtain a stronger result and show in particular that the set of $\mathscr{P}$-free blocking games is closed under addition, which yields that every $\mathscr{P}$-free blocking game is invertible modulo the blocking universe. This has consequences for the invertible subgroups of various other mis\`ere monoids.</description>

Abstract: A hypergroup is called an elementary abelian 2-hypergroup if it is a constrained direct product of the closed subsets of two elements. In this paper, the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are studied. All closed subsets and all strongly normal closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are determined. The numbers of all closed subsets and all strongly normal closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are given. A criterion for the isomorphic closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups is displayed. The automorphism groups of all closed subsets of the elementary abelian 2-hypergroups are presented.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

Abstract: We extend the recently developed theory of Roehrig and Zwegers on indefinite theta functions to prove certain power series are modular forms. As a consequence, we obtain several power series identities for powers of the generating function of triangular numbers. We also show that these identities arise as specializations of denominator identities of affine Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Vertex isoperimetry on signed graphs and spectra of non-bipartite Cayley and Cayley sum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a non-bipartite finite Cayley graph, we show the non-trivial eigenvalues of its normalized adjacency matrix lie in the interval $$\left[-1+\frac{ch_{out}^2}{d},1-\frac{Ch_{out}^2}{d}\right],$$ for some absolute constant $c$ and $C$, where $h_{out}$ stands for the outer vertex boundary isoperimetric constant. This improves upon recent obtained estimates aiming at a quantitative version of a result due to Breuillard, Green, Guralnick and Tao. We achieve this by extending the work of Bobkov, Houdr\'e and Tetali on vertex isoperimetry to the setting of signed graphs. We further extend our interval estimate to the settings of vertex transitive graphs and Cayley sum graphs. As a byproduct, we answer positively open questions proposed recently by Moorman, Ralli and Tetali.</description>

Abstract: Minimal codes are linear codes where all non-zero codewords are minimal, i.e., whose support is not properly contained in the support of another codeword. The minimum possible length of such a $k$-dimensional linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is denoted by $m(k,q)$. Here we determine $m(7,2)$, $m(8,2)$, and $m(9,2)$, as well as full classifications of all codes attaining $m(k,2)$ for $k\le 7$ and those attaining $m(9,2)$. We give improved upper bounds for $m(k,2)$ for all $10\le k\le 17$. It turns out that in many cases the attaining extremal codes have the property that the weights of all codewords are divisible by some constant $\Delta&gt;1$. So, here we study the minimum lengths of minimal codes where we additionally assume that the weights of the codewords are divisible by $\Delta$. As a byproduct we also give a few binary linear codes improving the best known lower bound for the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>Posets arising from decompositions of objects in a monoidal category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a symmetric monoidal category $C$ with product $\sqcup$, where the neutral element for the product is an initial object, we consider the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects of a given object $X$. When this poset has finite height, we define decompositions and partial decompositions of $X$ which are coherent with $\sqcup$, and order them by refinement. From these posets, we define complexes of frames and partial bases, augmented Bergman complexes and related ordered versions. We propose a unified approach to the study of their combinatorics and homotopy type, establishing various properties and relations between them. Via explicit homotopy formulas, we will be able to transfer structural properties, such as Cohen-Macaulayness.
  In well-studied scenarios, the poset of $\sqcup$-complemented subobjects specializes to the poset of free factors of a free group, the subspace poset of a vector space, the poset of non-degenerate subspaces of a vector space with a non-degenerate form, and the lattice of flats of a matroid. The decomposition and partial decomposition posets, the complex of frames and partial bases together with the ordered versions, either coincide with well-known structures, generalize them, or yield new interesting objects. In these particular cases, we provide new results along with open questions and conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14287v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry of tropical Fermat-Weber points in terms of the symmetric tropical metric over the tropical projective torus. It is well-known that a tropical Fermat-Weber point of a given sample is not unique and we show that the set of all possible Fermat-Weber points forms a polytrope. To prove this, we show that the tropical Fermat-Weber is the dual of a minimum-cost flow problem, and that its polytrope is a bounded cell of a tropical hyperplane arrangement given by both max- and min-tropical hyperplanes with apices given by the sample. We also define tropical Fermat-Weber gradients and provide a gradient descent algorithm that converges to the Fermat-Weber polytrope.</description>

      <title>Weak Degeneracy of Planar Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak degeneracy of a graph $G$ is a numerical parameter that was recently introduced by the first two authors with the aim of understanding the power of greedy algorithms for graph coloring. Every $d$-degenerate graph is weakly $d$-degenerate, but the converse is not true in general (for example, all connected $d$-regular graphs except cycles and cliques are weakly $(d-1)$-degenerate). If $G$ is weakly $d$-degenerate, then the list-chromatic number of $G$ is at most $d+1$, and the same upper bound holds for various other parameters such as the DP-chromatic number and the paint number. Here we rectify a mistake in a paper of the first two authors and give a correct proof that planar graphs are weakly $4$-degenerate, strengthening the famous result of Thomassen that planar graphs are $5$-list-colorable.</description>

Abstract: $m$-location is a local combinatorial condition for flag simplicial complexes introduced by Osajda. Osajda showed that simply connected 8-located locally 5-large complexes are hyperbolic. We treat the nonpositive curvature case of 7-located locally 5-large complexes.
  We show that any minimal area disc diagram in a 7-located locally 5-large complex is itself 7-located and locally 5-large. We define a natural CAT(0) metric for 7-located disc diagrams and use this to prove that simply connected 7-located locally 5-large complexes have quadratic isoperimetric function. Along the way, we prove that locally weakly systolic complexes are 7-located locally 5-large.</description>

Abstract: We define the HOMFLY polynomial of a forest quiver $Q$ using a recursive definition on the underlying graph of the quiver. We then show that this polynomial is equal to the HOMFLY polynomial of any plabic link which comes from a connected plabic graph whose quiver is $Q$. We also prove a closed-form expression for the HOMFLY polynomial of a forest quiver $Q$ in terms of the independent sets of $Q$.</description>

Abstract: A rooted arborescence of a directed graph is a spanning tree directed towards a particular vertex. A recent work of Chepuri et al. showed that the arborescences of a covering graph of a directed graph G are closely related to the arborescences of G. In this paper, we study the weighted sum of arborescences of a random covering graph and give a formula for the expected value, resolving a conjecture of Chepuri et al.</description>

      <title>The partial derivative of ratios of Schur polynomials and applications to symplectic quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a ratio of Schur polynomials $s_{\lambda}/s_{\rho}$ associated to partitions $\lambda$ and $\rho$ such $\lambda\subsetneq\rho$ has a negative partial derivative at any point where all variables are positive. This is accomplished by establishing an injective map between sets of pairs of skew semistandard Young tableaux that preserves the product of the corresponding monomials. We use this result and the description of the first Laurent coefficient of the Hilbert series of the graded algebra of regular functions on a linear symplectic quotient by the circle to demonstrate that many such symplectic quotients are not graded regularly diffeomorphic. In addition, we give an upper bound for this Laurent coefficient in terms of the largest two weights of the circle representation and demonstrate that all but finitely many circle symplectic quotients of each dimension are not graded regularly diffeomorphic to linear symplectic quotients by $\operatorname{SU}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how much injective morphisms can increase the repetitiveness of a given word. This question has a few possible variations depending on the meaning of ``repetitiveness''. We concentrate on fractional exponents of finite words and asymptotic critical exponents of infinite words. We characterize finite words that, when mapped by injective morphisms, can have arbitrarily high fractional exponent. For infinite words, alongside other results, we show that the asymptotic critical exponent grows at most by a constant factor (depending on the size of the alphabet) when mapped by an injective morphism. For both finite and infinite words, the binary case is better understood than the general case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.06506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, network models have become more complex with the development of big data. Therefore, more advanced network analysis is required. In this paper, we introduce a new quantitative measure named combinatorial evaluation, which combines the discrete geometry concept of Forman Ricci curvature and the game theory concept of the Shapley value. We elucidated the characteristics of combinatorial evaluation by proving several properties of this indicator. Furthermore, we demonstrated the usefulness of the concept by calculating and comparing the conventional centrality and combinatorial evaluation for a concrete graph. The code is available at https://github.com/Taiki-Yamada-Math/CombinatorialEvaluation.</description>

      <title>A survey on big Ramsey structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been much progress in the field of structural Ramsey theory, in particular in the study of big Ramsey degrees. In all known examples of infinite structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, there is in fact a single expansion of the structure, called a big Ramsey structure, which correctly encodes the exact big Ramsey degrees of every finite substructure simultaneously. The first half of the article collects facts about this phenomenon that have appeared in the literature into a single cohesive framework, thus offering a conceptual survey of big Ramsey structures. We present some original results indicating that the standard methods of proving finite big Ramsey degrees automatically yield big Ramsey structures, often with desirable extra properties. The second half of the article is a survey in the more traditional sense, discussing numerous examples from the literature and showing how they fit into our framework. We also present some general results on how big Ramsey degrees are affected by expanding structures with unary functions.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and let $d$ be a positive integer. In this paper, we generalize Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Valli\`{e}res to weighted graphs. In particular, we prove an analogue of Iwasawa's class number formula and that of Kida's formula for compatible systems of $(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^d$-covers of weighted graphs. We also provide numerical examples of characteristic elements and Iwasawa invariants. At the end of this paper, we give an application of the ideas of Iwasawa theory to the theory of discrete-time quantum walks in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how neural networks can drive mathematical discovery through a case study of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem, a long-standing open problem at the intersection of discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics that is concerned with coloring the plane while avoiding monochromatic unit-distance pairs. Using neural networks as approximators, we reformulate this mixed discrete-continuous geometric coloring problem with hard constraints as an optimization task with a probabilistic, differentiable loss function. This enables gradient-based exploration of admissible configurations that most significantly led to the discovery of two novel six-colorings, providing the first improvement in thirty years to the off-diagonal variant of the original problem. Here, we establish the underlying machine learning approach used to obtain these results and demonstrate its broader applicability through additional numerical insights.</description>

Abstract: I introduce a geometric interpretation of the set of standard graded Artinian Gorenstein algebras of codimension $n$ and degree $d$: the standard locus, which is a subset of the projective space of degree $d$ polynomials in $n$ variables, and I characterize it. Under opportune hypothesis, I prove that the locus of full Perazzo polynomials is the union of the minimal dimensional irreducible components of the standard locus and it is pure dimensional subset. On the other hand, I associate to any homogeneous polynomial a topological space, which is a CW-complex. Using all these sets, I prove that the Hilbert function restricted to the standard locus has minimal values on any irreducible component of the domain. I apply all this to the Full Perazzo Conjecture and I prove it.</description>

Abstract: A vector partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of scalar partitions. In the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Group Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations. Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM reconstruction package.</description>

      <title>PyRigi -- a general-purpose Python package for the rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PyRigi, a novel Python package designed to study the rigidity properties of graphs and frameworks. Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential.</description>
