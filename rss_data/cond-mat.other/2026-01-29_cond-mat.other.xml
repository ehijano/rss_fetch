      <title>Complex segregation patterns in confined nonuniform granular shearing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When polydisperse granular systems are sheared, the transverse dynamics is characterized by the interplay of size segregation and diffusion. Segregation in nonuniform and confined shearing flows is studied using annular shear cell experiments complemented with discrete numerical simulations of bidisperse, inelastic, and frictional spheres under gravity. We explored the role of shear localization, granular temperature, boundaries, and mixture properties in the evolution of the segregation rate and the maximum degree of segregation achieved by a bidisperse granular system in the steady state. A faster segregation process and a more developed degree of segregation is observed for bidisperse mixtures with a larger size ratio and a higher proportion of large particles. Normally, in the presence of gravity, size segregation induces large particles to rise and small particles to sink. However, two additional complex segregation patterns were found: inverse segregation and horizontal segregation. The first might be related to the kinematics of the flow, while the second is a geometrical effect. This additional segregation mechanism, in addition to diffusion fluxes and high confining pressure, hampers complete segregation in the steady state, where some degree of mixing always persists.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling and beyond in Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) describes the emergence of spin-polarized electron transport in chiral systems without magnetic fields, a remarkable effect in light-element materials with weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This mini-review analyzes the microscopic origins of CISS, highlighting how molecular chirality, local electric fields, and dynamic distortions enhance effective SOC and drive spin-dependent transport. We critically assess existing models in terms of their symmetry constraints, phenomenological assumptions, and compliance with Onsager reciprocity. Recent developments combining relativistic quantum mechanics and complete multipole representations reveal a direct link between chirality density and spin current pseudoscalars, suggesting a field-theoretic foundation for CISS. These insights could help position light-element chiral nanomaterials as tunable platforms for probing and engineering spin-selective phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Observation of Real-Space Dynamic Electron Correlation in Beryllium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron correlation in solid has a major impact on material properties. However, it has been studied mainly by theory, with very limited direct experimental investigations. Here, we report the results of real-space measurement of dynamic electron correlation using inelastic X-ray scattering on polycrystalline beryllium. The data are expressed as the energy-resolved dynamic pair-distribution function. Our results confirm the size of the exchange-correlation hole as ~2 {\AA}, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, at the plasmon energy of ~21 eV, the exchange-correlation hole is extended up to 4-5 {\AA}, suggesting a unique influence of the dynamic plasmon state.</description>

      <title>Stability and Decay of Macrovortices in Rotating Bose Gases Beyond Mean Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation, stability, and decay of macrovortices in a rotating Bose gas confined by a Mexican-hat potential with a multiconfigurational ansatz. By systematically including correlations beyond the mean-field level, we map the equilibrium phase diagram and identify regimes of coexistence between vortex lattices and multiply charge central vortices. Quench dynamics reveals that macrovortices are robust under changes in rotation or interaction strength, sustaining clean monopole oscillations with well-separated, vorticity-dependent breathing frequencies. In contrast, trap quenches trigger a universal decay process mediated by vortex-phonon coupling, in which rotational energy is progressively transferred to compressible modes until the macrovortex splits into singly quantized vortices. Our results demonstrate that macrovortex lifetimes and decay pathways can be tuned by trap confinement, providing experimentally accessible signatures of vortex-phonon interactions and collective energy transfer in correlated quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Establishing Atomic Coherence in Twisted Oxide Membranes Containing Volatile Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted oxide membranes represent a promising platform for exploring moire physics and emergent quantum phenomena. However, the presence of amorphous interfacial dead layers in conventional oxide heterostructures impedes coherent coupling and suppresses moire-induced interactions. While high-temperature thermal treatments can facilitate interfacial bonding, additional care is needed for materials containing volatile elements, where elevated temperatures may cause elemental loss. This study demonstrates the realization of atomically coherent, chemically bonded interface in twisted NaNbO3 heterostructures through controlled oxygen-annealing treatment. Atomic-resolution imaging and spectroscopy reveal ordered perovskite registry accompanied by systematic lattice contraction and modified electronic structure at the twisted interface, providing signatures of chemical reconstruction rather than physical adhesion. This reconstructed interface mediates highly asymmetric strain propagation in which the bottom membrane remains nearly relaxed while the top membrane accommodates substantial shear strain, thereby establishing a strain gradient that enables long-range electromechanical coupling throughout the twisted oxide membranes. By resolving the nature of the reconstructed interface, these findings establish a robust pathway for achieving coherent and strain-tunable oxide moire superlattices, opening pathways to engineer emergent ferroic and electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of classical memory in quantum hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple framework for classical and quantum ``memory'' in which the Hamiltonian at time $t$ depends on past values of a control Hamiltonian through a causal kernel. This structure naturally describes finite-bandwidth or filtered control channels and provides a clean way to distinguish between memory in the control and genuine non-Markovian dynamics of the state. We focus on models where $H(t)=H_0+\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,H_1(s)\,ds$, and illustrate the framework on single-qubit examples such as $H(t)=\sigma_z+\Phi(t)\sigma_x$ with $\Phi(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}K(t-s)\,u(s)\,ds$. We derive basic properties of such dynamics, discuss conditions for unitarity, give an equivalent time-local description for exponential kernels, and show explicitly how hysteresis arises in the response of a driven qubit.</description>

      <title>Time complexity of a monitored quantum search with resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching a database is a central task in computer science and is paradigmatic of transport and optimization problems in physics. For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $\tau(N)=\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory approach for multistage chemical kinetics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>
