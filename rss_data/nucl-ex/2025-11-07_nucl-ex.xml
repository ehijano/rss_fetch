      <title>Predictions of baryon directed flow in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions of the proton directed flow ($v_1$) in semicentral Au+Au collisions in the energy range between 4.5 and 7.7 GeV are done. The calculations are performed within the model of three-fluid dynamics with crossover equation of state, which well reproduces the proton $v_1$ both below 4.5 GeV and above 7.7 GeV, as well as bulk observables in the energy range of interest. It is predicted that the proton flow evolves non-monotonously. At the energy of 7.2 GeV it exhibits antiflow (i.e. negative slope of $v_1(y)$) in the midrapidity. At 7.7 GeV, the flow returns to the normal pattern in accordance with the STAR data. The midrapidity $v_1$-slope excitation functions within the first-order phase and crossover transitions to quark-gluon phase (QGP) turn out to be qualitatively similar, but the amplitude of the wiggle in the crossover scenario is much smaller than that in the strong first-order phase transition. Therefore, the change of sign followed by minimum at 7.2 GeV in the $v_1$-slope excitation function indicates onset of (weak phase or crossover) transition to QGP. The second change of the sign at 11.5 GeV apparently results from interplay between incomplete baryon stopping and transverse expansion of the system.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the exclusive photoproduction of a di-meson pair with large invariant mass, $\gamma N \rightarrow N' M_1M_2$, in the framework of collinear factorisation. The mesons considered $M_1$ and $M_2$ are either pions or rho mesons, charged or neutral. We consider the kinematic regime characterised by a large invariant mass of the two-meson system, and a small deflection of the nucleon in the centre-of-mass frame. In this kinematic domain, the amplitude factorises into a perturbative hard part and non-perturbative parts described by Generalised Parton Distributions (GPDs) and Distribution Amplitudes (DAs). We automate the calculation of the fully differential cross section at leading twist and leading order, and we present some numerical results at JLab 12 GeV kinematics. This class of processes provides yet more exclusive $2 \to 3$ channels that can be used to extract GPDs.</description>

      <title>The size of the quark-gluon plasma in ultracentral collisions: impact of initial density fluctuations on the average transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T\rangle$ of outgoing particles increases as a function of the particle multiplicity in ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies. This increase was originally predicted on the basis of simulations where the multiplicity increase occurred at constant volume, so that it implied a larger density and temperature. However, recent state-of-the-art simulations have shown that, for some models of initial condition, the volume may vary with the multiplicity in ultracentral collisions. We elucidate this effect by analytically relating the variation of the volume to the radial distribution of the one- and two-point functions of the fluctuating density field. We show that the volume variation is small if the total entropy of the ultracentral collisions scales with the mass number of the colliding isotopes. We argue that probing detailed transverse distributions of initial-state fluctuations through the ultracentral $\langle p_T\rangle$ has nontrivial implications for models of nuclear structure and of the pre-equilibrium stages.</description>

      <title>Upgrades of the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeter System for Run 3 at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental studies of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) depend crucially on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs) that measure neutrons produced at near-beam rapidity in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In hadronic nuclear collisions these neutrons are mainly spectator neutrons, those that do not scatter from opposing nucleons during the collision. As a result, the ZDCs provide a vital probe of heavy ion collision geometry. The ZDCs are also essential in the study of ultra-peripheral collisions that are initiated by photons associated with the electric fields of one or both nuclei. Coherent photon emission typically leaves the photon emitter intact, making the observation of no ZDC signal, on one or both sides, a tag of such processes. The ATLAS ZDCs, built prior to Run 1 were substantially upgraded for LHC Run 3. The primary upgrades included replacement of the quartz Cherenkov radiator with $\text{H}_2$-doped fused silica rods; installation of fast air-core signal cables between the ZDC and the ATLAS USA15 cavern; new LED-based calibration system; and new electronics implemented for readout and fully-digital triggering. The ZDCs were also augmented with new "Reaction Plane Detectors" (RPDs) designed to measure the transverse centroid of multi-neutron showers to allow event-by-event reconstruction of the directed-flow plane in nuclear collisions. The Run~3 ZDC detectors, including the RPDs, are described in detail with emphasis on aspects that are new for Run~3.</description>

      <title>Equation of state for hyperonic neutron-star matter in SU(3) flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a relativistic mean-field model calibrated to finite-nucleus observables and bulk properties of dense nuclear matter, we investigate hyperonic neutron-star matter within an SU(3) flavor-symmetry scheme. To retain SU(6)-based couplings within SU(3) flavor symmetry, we add a quartic $\phi$ self-interaction and $\phi$-$\rho$ mixing. We demonstrate the roles of $\alpha_{v}$ ($F/(F+D)$ ratio), $\theta_{v}$ (mixing angle), and $z_{v}$ (singlet-to-octet coupling ratio) in SU(3)-invariant vector-meson couplings. It is found that $z_{v}$ predominantly controls the maximum mass of a neutron star, and $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars can be supported for $z_{v}\le0.15$. The $\alpha_{v}$ also helps sustain large masses, whereas $\theta_{v}$ has a smaller effect on neutron-star properties. This SU(3) framework reconciles nuclear and astrophysical constraints, and offers a plausible resolution to the hyperon puzzle.</description>
