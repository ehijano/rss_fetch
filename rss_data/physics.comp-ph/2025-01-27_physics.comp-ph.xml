      <title>Stochastic Method for Delayed Neutron Precursors Transport in Liquid Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel stochastic method for modeling the transport of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) in liquid nuclear fuel. The method incorporates advection and diffusion effects into the Monte Carlo solution of the neutron balance equation by leveraging the Green's function of the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation. For a 1D system, we demonstrate that the Green's function can be interpreted as the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the position increment of a Brownian motion with drift. Using this interpretation, the position of DNPs is sampled via a time-of-flight process combined with a drift and diffusion model. The method is validated on a modified 1D rod problem, where results from the Monte Carlo implementation are compared against those obtained using a deterministic approach. The comparison confirms that the method accurately captures the impact of fuel velocity and diffusion on neutron flux. As expected, the fuel velocity shifts the neutron flux. Reactivity decreases as a function of speed while diffusion can counteract this decrease under certain conditions. While the current study is limited to 1D systems, the approach could be extended to higher dimensions and more complex geometries by replacing the Green's function with the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) associated with the ADR equation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Numerical Relativity with Code Generation: CUDA-enabled Hyperbolic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer, the Einstein Telescope, and LISA, demand highly accurate and extensive gravitational wave (GW) catalogs to faithfully extract physical parameters from observed signals. However, numerical relativity (NR) faces significant challenges in generating these catalogs at the required scale and accuracy on modern computers, as NR codes do not fully exploit modern GPU capabilities. In response, we extend NRPy, a Python-based NR code-generation framework, to develop NRPyEllipticGPU -- a CUDA-optimized elliptic solver tailored for the binary black hole (BBH) initial data problem. NRPyEllipticGPU is the first GPU-enabled elliptic solver in the NR community, supporting a variety of coordinate systems and demonstrating substantial performance improvements on both consumer-grade and HPC-grade GPUs. We show that, when compared to a high-end CPU, NRPyEllipticGPU achieves on a high-end GPU up to a sixteenfold speedup in single precision while increasing double-precision performance by a factor of 2--4. This performance boost leverages the GPU's superior parallelism and memory bandwidth to achieve a compute-bound application and enhancing the overall simulation efficiency. As NRPyEllipticGPU shares the core infrastructure common to NR codes, this work serves as a practical guide for developing full, CUDA-optimized NR codes.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Phase Transitions in Multiscale Media: Universality and Critical Exponents in the Fractional Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Until now multiscale quantum problems have appeared to be out of reach at the many-body level relevant to strongly correlated materials and current quantum information devices. In fact, they can be modeled with $q$-th order fractional derivatives, as we demonstrate in this work, treating classical and quantum phase transitions in a fractional Ising model for $0 &lt; q \leq 2$ ($q = 2$ is the usual Ising model). We show that fractional derivatives not only enable continuous tuning of critical exponents such as $\nu$, $\delta$, and $\eta$, but also define the Hausdorff dimension $H_D$ of the system tied geometrically to the anomalous dimension $\eta$. We discover that for classical systems, $H_D$ is precisely equal to the fractional order $q$. In contrast, for quantum systems, $H_D$ deviates from this direct equivalence, scaling more gradually, driven by additional degrees of freedom introduced by quantum fluctuations. These results reveal how fractional derivatives fundamentally modify the fractal geometry of many-body interactions, directly influencing the universal symmetries of the system and overcoming traditional dimensional restrictions on phase transitions. Specifically, we find that for $q &lt; 1$ in the classical regime and $q &lt; 2$ in the quantum regime, fractional interactions allow phase transitions in one dimension. This work establishes fractional derivatives as a powerful tool for engineering critical behavior, offering new insights into the geometry of multiscale systems and opening avenues for exploring tunable quantum materials on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 have provided a multiscale physics perspective based on Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between scale transformation by filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider that the spin angle momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the fluctuations at the microscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the fluctuations at the microscopic scale. In particular, the fluctuations can be reproduced at more macroscopic scales and amplified according to the size of kernel radius. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of cryogenic liquid helium4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity. In conclusion, we provide a new multiscale physical framework for cryogenic liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>Efficiently charting the space of mixed vacancy-ordered perovskites by machine-learning encoded atomic-site information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacancy-ordered double perovskites (VODPs) are promising alternatives to three-dimensional lead halide perovskites for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Mixing these materials creates a vast compositional space, allowing for highly tunable electronic and optical properties. However, the extensive chemical landscape poses significant challenges in efficiently screening candidates with target properties. In this study, we illustrate the diversity of electronic and optical characteristics as well as the nonlinear mixing effects on electronic structures within mixed VODPs. For mixed systems with limited local environment options, the information regarding atomic-site occupation in-principle determines both structural configurations and all essential properties. Building upon this concept, we have developed a model that integrates a data-augmentation scheme with a transformer-inspired graph neural network (GNN), which encodes atomic-site information from mixed systems. This approach enables us to accurately predict band gaps and formation energies for test samples, achieving Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 21 meV and 3.9 meV/atom, respectively. Trained with datasets that include (up to) ternary mixed systems and supercells with less than 72 atoms, our model can be generalized to medium- and high-entropy mixed VODPs (with 4 to 6 principal mixing elements) and large supercells containing more than 200 atoms. Furthermore, our model successfully reproduces experimentally observed bandgap bowing in Sn-based mixed VODPs and reveals an unconventional mixing effect that can result in smaller band gaps compared to those found in pristine systems.</description>

      <title>Ballistic diffusion vs. damped oscillation of energy in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the quantum dynamics of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric kicked harmonic oscillator. We observe that directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy coexist under the non-resonant conditions, whereas both the momentum and energy oscillate as damped cosine functions with identical frequencies under the resonant conditions. The research shows that the directed current of momentum and ballistic diffusion of energy arise from nearest-neighbor hopping between momentum eigenstates with the non-Hermitian driving, while the damped oscillations of momentum and energy originate from resonant coupling between the non-Hermitian driving and the harmonic oscillator. Our findings indicate that the non-Hermiticity and the frequency characteristic of this system collectively result in these distinctive dynamical behaviors. </description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach, described by Bai and Breen, calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle. This approach, which is mathematically equivalent to finding the first moment of the Fourier series of the mass density, suffers from some numerical error. Here we discuss this inaccuracy and propose an extension that overcomes it, enabling improved accuracy across computational simulation.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of RANS Solver Convergence via Initialization with Wake Extension Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Use of appropriate initialization to warm-start Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent flow can facilitate convergence and lead to efficient use of computational resources. In this work, a method to model downstream wake development in external turbulent flow is proposed and used for RANS solver convergence acceleration. To balance the model accuracy and cost, the proposed method divides the analysis domain into three regions: near-body, wake and off-body. An approach based on a convolutional neural network is introduced as an efficient method to predict the downstream wake development. The model training only requires data from a single simulation, and its use is demonstrated to be effective in accelerating the RANS simulation when combined with an accurate flow prediction in the near-body region. The simulation using the proposed method took 26.3x fewer iterations, achieving 16.4x speedup in wall-clock time, compared to a baseline run using freestream initialization.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Parallel Multi-Coordinate Descent Methods for Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a multi-threaded parallel coordinate descent full configuration interaction algorithm (mCDFCI), for the electronic structure ground-state calculation in the configuration interaction framework. The FCI problem is reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem, and tackled by a modified block coordinate descent method with a deterministic compression strategy. mCDFCI is designed to prioritize determinants based on their importance, with block updates enabling efficient parallelization on shared-memory, multi-core computing infrastructure. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm by computing an accurate benchmark energy for the chromium dimer in the Ahlrichs SV basis (48e, 42o), which explicitly includes $2.07 \times 10^9$ variational determinants. We also provide the binding curve of the nitrogen dimer under the cc-pVQZ basis set (14e, 110o). Benchmarks show up to $79.3\%$ parallel efficiency on 128 cores.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Algorithm for Sample-Based Krylov Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximating the ground state of many-body systems is a key computational bottleneck underlying important applications in physics and chemistry. It has long been viewed as a promising application for quantum computers. The most widely known quantum algorithm for ground state approximation, quantum phase estimation, is out of reach of current quantum processors due to its high circuit-depths. Quantum diagonalization algorithms based on subspaces represent alternatives to phase estimation, which are feasible for pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here, we introduce a quantum diagonalization algorithm which combines two key ideas on quantum subspaces: a classical diagonalization based on quantum samples, and subspaces constructed with quantum Krylov states. We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time under the working assumptions of Krylov quantum diagonalization and sparseness of the ground state. We then show numerical investigations of lattice Hamiltonians, which indicate that our method can outperform existing Krylov quantum diagonalization in the presence of shot noise, making our approach well-suited for near-term quantum devices. Finally, we carry out the largest ground-state quantum simulation of the single-impurity Anderson model on a system with $41$ bath sites, using $85$ qubits and up to $6 \cdot 10^3$ two-qubit gates on a Heron quantum processor, showing excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sunny is a Julia package designed to serve the needs of the quantum magnetism community. It supports the specification of a very broad class of spin models and a diverse suite of numerical solvers. These include powerful methods for simulating spin dynamics both in and out of equilibrium. Uniquely, it features a broad generalization of classical and semiclassical approaches to SU(N) coherent states, which is useful for studying systems exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling or local entanglement effects. Sunny also offers a well-developed framework for calculating the dynamical spin structure factor, enabling direct comparison with scattering experiments. Ease of use is a priority, with tools for symmetry-guided modeling and interactive visualization.</description>
