      <title>Water under hydrophobic confinement: entropy and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of liquid water are known to change drastically in confined geometries. A most interesting and intriguing phenomenon is that the diffusion of water is found to be strongly enhanced by the proximity of a hydrophobic confining wall relative to the bulk diffusion. We report a molecular dynamics simulation using a classical water model investigating the water diffusion near a non-interacting smooth confining wall, which is assumed to imitate a hydrophobic surface. A pronounced diffusion enhancement is observed in the water layers adjacent to the wall. We present evidence that the observed diffusion enhancement can be accounted for, with numerical accuracy, using the universal scaling law for liquid diffusion that relates the liquid diffusion rate to the excess entropy. These results show that the scaling law, that has so far only been used for the description of the diffusion in simple liquids, can successfully describe the diffusion in water. It is thus shown that the law can be used for the description of water dynamics under nano-scale confinement which is currently a subject of intense research activity.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for concentration-gradient-driven electrolyte transport through a 2D membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials exhibit unique properties that are promising for diverse applications, including those relevant to concentration-gradient-driven transport of electrolyte solutions through porous membranes made from these materials, such as water desalination, osmotic power, and iontronics. Here we derive general equations, and determine scaling laws in the thick and thin electric-double-layer limits, that quantify the variation of the concentration-gradient-driven flow rate, solute flux and electric current with the pore radius, surface charge density and Debye screening length for the transport of a dilute electrolyte solution through a circular aperture in an infinitesimally thin planar membrane. We also determine scaling laws for the electric-field-driven flow rate in the thin electric-double-layer limit in the same geometry. We show that these scaling laws accurately capture the scaling relationships from finite-element numerical simulations within the Debye-H\"uckel regime, and extend the theory to obtain scaling laws in the thin electric-double-layer limit that hold even when the electric potential energy is large compared with the thermal energy. These scaling laws indicate unusual behavior for concentration-gradient-driven flow in a 2D membrane that is not seen in thicker membranes, which has broad implications for liquid transport through membranes whose thickness comparable to, or smaller than, their pore size.</description>

      <title>A Tactile Void</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas cavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using tribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics and deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or slid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We propose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load showing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its possible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the cavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.</description>

      <title>Conformations, Dynamics, and Looping Kinetics of Partially Active Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conformational and dynamical properties of a partially active Rouse chain, where activity is localized within a specific segment, positioned at various locations along the chain and spanning any given length. Through analytical methods and simulations, we reveal how the location and size of the active segment influence polymer swelling patterns. Likewise, we observe that the mean squared distance between two points along the polymer, as well as the mean squared displacement of a tagged point, are notably affected by the local activity. In addition, the reconfiguration and looping dynamics show anomalous scaling behaviors, particularly in intermediate chain lengths, capturing the interplay between persistence of active motion and polymer relaxation dynamics. Our model, relevant to spatially varying activity observed in active biopolymeric systems, provides a basis for exploring more realistic models of chromatin behavior, especially those incorporating heterogeneous activity.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally strong double-layer barriers generated by polyampholyte salt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments using the Surface Force Apparatus (SFA) have found anomalously long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces in concentrated salt solutions. Ion clustering have been suggested as a possible origin of this behaviour. In this work, we demonstrate that if such stable clusters indeed form, they are able to induce remarkably strong free energy barriers, under conditions where a corresponding solution of simple salt provide negligible forces. Our cluster model is based on connected ions producing a polyampholyte salt, containing a symmetric mixture of monovalent cationic and anionic polyampholytes. Ion distributions and surface interactions are evaluated utilising statistical-mechanical (classical) polymer Density Functional Theory, cDFT. In the Supporting Information, we briefly investigate a range of different polymer architectures (connectivities), but in the main part of the work a polyampholyte ion is modelled as a linear chain with alternating charges, in which the ends carry an identical charge (hence, a monovalent net charge). These salts are able to generate repulsions, between similarly charged surfaces, of a remarkable strength - exceeding those from simple salts by orders of magnitude. The underlying mechanism for this is the formation of brush-like layers at the surfaces, i.e. the repulsion is strongly related to excluded volume effects, in a manner similar to the interaction between surfaces carrying grafted polymers. We believe our results are relevant not only to possible mechanisms underlying anomalously long-ranged underscreening in concentrated simple salt solutions, but also for the potential use of synthesised polyampholyte salt as extremely efficient stabilisers of colloidal dispersions.</description>

      <title>Interfacial and density fluctuations in a lattice model of motility-induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze motility-induced phase separation and bubbly phase separation in a two-dimensional lattice model of self-propelled particles. We compare systems where the dense (liquid) phase has slab and droplet geometries. We find that interfacial fluctuations of the slab are well-described by capillary wave theory, despite the existence of bubbles in the dense phase. We attribute this to a separation of time scales between bubble expulsion and interfacial relaxation. We also characterize dependence of liquid and vapor densities on the curvature of the liquid droplet, as well as the density fluctuations inside the phases. The vapor phase behaves similarly to an equilibrium system, displaying a Laplace pressure effect that shifts its density, and Gaussian density fluctuations. The liquid phase has large non-Gaussian fluctuations, but this is not accompanied by a large density shift, contrary to the equilibrium case. Nevertheless, the shift of the vapor density can be used to infer an effective surface tension that appears to also quantify capillary wave fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Partition sum of thermal, under-constrained systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>

      <title>Myosin-independent amoeboid cell motility</title>

Abstract: Mammalian cell polarization and motility are important processes involved in many physiological and pathological phenomena, such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. The traditional view of mammalian cell motility suggests that molecular motors, adhesion, and cell deformation are all necessary components for mammalian cell movement. However, experiments on the immune cell system have shown that the inhibition of molecular motors does not significantly affect cell motility. We present a new theory and simulations demonstrating that actin polymerization alone is sufficient to induce spontaneously cell polarity accompanied by the retrograde flow. These findings provide a new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cell movement and at the same time provide a simple mechanism for cell motility in diverse configurations, e.g. on an adherent substrate, in a non-adherent matrix, or in liquids.</description>

      <title>Contrasting thermodynamic and hydrodynamic entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>
