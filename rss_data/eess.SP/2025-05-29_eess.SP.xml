      <title>Gauss-Ramanujan Functions: Constructions, Properties, and Applications in Communications and Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21691v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, I construct a new set of functions based on Ramanujan sequences (RSEs), Gaussian pulse (GP), and its delayed Gaussian pulse (DGP). The motivation for this construction is based on the special properties of RSEs, GP, and DGP. First, I present a procedure for constructing Gauss-Ramanujan (GauRam) functions using selected RSEs. I develop an insightful analysis for deterministic and stochastic overlap between GP and DGP. Specifically, I present exact and closed form approximation expressions for delay-averaged GP and DGP overlap and then evaluate them numerically. Later, I derive and analyze the mathematical (spectral) properties of selected GauRam functions. I extend the analysis by analyzing the Hilbert transform of the first-order GauRam function and validating orthogonality and its usefulness in analytic signal representations.
  Furthermore, I present insightful applications of these functions in communications and signal processing. Specifically, I present the continuous-wave Gauss-Ramanujan modulation (GRM) scheme, Gauss-Ramanujan Shift Keying (GRSK) scheme, and Gauss-Ramanujan wavelets and their analysis and comparisons with benchmarking. The desirable properties of these novel modulation schemes and wavelets enable their use in next-generation hybrid and energy-efficient communication systems and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Bounds for Optimized Doppler-Based Motion Detection in UHF-RFID Readers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a widely used technology for identifying and locating objects equipped with low-cost RFID transponders (tags). UHF (Ultra High Frequency) RFID operates in frequency bands around 900 MHz and supports communication distances of up to 15 m between the reader and the tag. Reliable motion detection is therefore a highly relevant feature in modern logistics - for example, to determine whether a tag is actually placed on a conveyor belt or merely in its vicinity.
  A promising approach for accurate motion detection is the use of the Doppler effect. Some state-of-the-art UHF-RFID readers already support Doppler shift measurements. However, their measurement accuracy is insufficient for many applications. In this paper, we propose an optimized method for the precise Doppler shift estimation using existing RFID systems - an essential step toward enabling RFID-based motion detection in future logistics. Further, we also derive the theoretical bounds for Doppler-based motion detection in UHF-RFID systems based on the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound. These bounds analyze the influence of tag signal strength, signal duration, and the intervals between multiple tag replies on the performance of motion detection and speed estimation algorithms. In addition, we establish theoretical limits that account for hardware constraints in current UHF-RFID readers.
  The results of this work provide valuable insights into the limitations of Doppler-based motion detection and support system-level performance optimization. They enable prediction of achievable performance based on reader noise figure, aiding in the design and tuning of RFID systems.</description>

      <title>CSI-Bench: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Dataset for Multi-task WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi sensing has emerged as a compelling contactless modality for human activity monitoring by capturing fine-grained variations in Channel State Information (CSI). Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled environments with homogeneous hardware and fragmented, session-based recordings that fail to reflect continuous daily activity.
  We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected using commercial WiFi edge devices across 26 diverse indoor environments with 35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization, and motion source recognition, as well as a co-labeled multitask dataset with joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the development of robust and generalizable models, CSI-Bench provides standardized evaluation splits and baseline results for both single-task and multi-task learning. CSI-Bench offers a foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving WiFi sensing systems in health and broader human-centric applications.</description>

      <title>Target Localization with Coprime Multistatic MIMO Radar via Coupled Canonical Polyadic Decomposition Based on Joint Eigenvalue Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates target localization using a multistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with two distinct coprime array configurations: coprime L-shaped arrays and coprime planar arrays. The observed signals are modeled as tensors that admit a coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (C-CPD) model. For each configuration, a C-CPD method is presented based on joint eigenvalue decomposition (J-EVD). This computational framework includes (semi-)algebraic and optimization-based C-CPD algorithms and target localization that fuses direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) information to calculate the optimal position of each target. Specifically, the proposed (semi-)algebraic methods exploit the rotational invariance of the Vandermonde structure in coprime arrays, similar to the multiple invariance property of \added{estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques} (ESPRIT), which transforms the model into a J-EVD problem and reduces computational complexity. The study also investigates the working conditions of the algorithm to understand model identifiability. Additionally, the proposed method does not rely on prior knowledge of non-orthogonal probing waveforms and is effective in challenging underdetermined scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing tensor-based approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Polarforming Design with Phase Shifter Based Polarization Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new form of polarization reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) that can form linear, circular, and general elliptical polarizations assisted by phase shifters (PSs). With PRAs, polarforming is achieved, which enables the antenna to shape its polarization into a desired state for aligning with that of the received electromagnetic (EM) wave or reconfiguring that of the transmit EM wave. To demonstrate the benefits of polarforming, we investigate a PRA-aided single-input single-output (SISO) communication system equipped with tunable PSs for polarization adaptation. We characterize the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver as a function of the phase shifts of PS-based PRAs. Moreover, we develop an alternating optimization approach to maximize the SNR by optimizing the phase shifts at both the transmitter and receiver. Finally, comprehensive simulation results are presented, which not only validate the effectiveness of polarforming in mitigating the channel depolarization effects, but also demonstrate its substantial performance improvement over conventional systems.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Prompt Decision Transformers for UAV-Assisted Communications with AoI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT) has recently demonstrated strong generalizability in dynamic resource allocation within unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, compared to conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, its performance is hindered due to zero-padding for varying state dimensions, inability to manage long-term energy constraint, and challenges in acquiring expert samples for few-shot fine-tuning in new scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-enhanced prompt Decision Transformer (APDT) framework to optimize trajectory planning and user scheduling, aiming to minimize the average age of information (AoI) under long-term energy constraint in UAV-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we enhance the convenional DT framework by incorporating an attention mechanism to accommodate varying numbers of terrestrial users, introducing a prompt mechanism based on short trajectory demonstrations for rapid adaptation to new scenarios, and designing a token-assisted method to address the UAV's long-term energy constraint. The APDT framework is first pre-trained on offline datasets and then efficiently generalized to new scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that APDT achieves twice faster in terms of convergence rate and reduces average AoI by $8\%$ compared to conventional DT.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Unrolling-based Denoising of Multimodal Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a denoising method of multimodal graph signals by iteratively solving signal restoration and graph learning problems. Many complex-structured data, i.e., those on sensor networks, can capture multiple modalities at each measurement point, referred to as modalities. They are also assumed to have an underlying structure or correlations in modality as well as space. Such multimodal data are regarded as graph signals on a twofold graph and they are often corrupted by noise. Furthermore, their spatial/modality relationships are not always given a priori: We need to estimate twofold graphs during a denoising algorithm. In this paper, we consider a signal denoising method on twofold graphs, where graphs are learned simultaneously. We formulate an optimization problem for that and parameters in an iterative algorithm are learned from training data by unrolling the iteration with deep algorithm unrolling. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing model- and deep learning-based graph signal denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Aspects of density approximation by tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-mass filters solve Bayesian recursive relations by approximating probability density functions of a system state over grids of discrete points. The approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The exponential increase of the number of the grid points can be mitigated by application of low-rank approximations of multidimensional arrays. Tensor train decompositions represent individual values by the product of matrices. This paper focuses on selected issues that are substantial in state estimation. Namely, the contamination of the density approximations by negative values is discussed first. Functional decompositions of quadratic functions are compared with decompositions of discretised Gaussian densities next. In particular, the connection of correlation with tensor train ranks is explored. Last, the consequences of interpolating the density values from one grid to a new grid are analysed.</description>

      <title>Empowering Intelligent Low-altitude Economy with Large AI Model Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude economy (LAE) represents an emerging economic paradigm that redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we outline open challenges to inspire future research.</description>

      <title>Toward Fully Neuromorphic Receivers for Ultra-Power Efficient Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural systems, has emerged as a promising approach for ultra-energy-efficient data processing by leveraging analog neuron structures and spike-based computation. However, its application in communication systems remains largely unexplored, with existing efforts mainly focused on mapping isolated communication algorithms onto spiking networks, often accompanied by substantial, traditional computational overhead due to transformations required to adapt problems to the spiking paradigm. In this work, we take a fundamentally different route and, for the first time, propose a fully neuromorphic communication receiver by applying neuromorphic principles directly in the analog domain from the very start of the receiver processing chain. Specifically, we examine a simple transmission scenario: a BPSK receiver with repetition coding, and show that we can achieve joint detection and decoding entirely through spiking signals. Our approach demonstrates error-rate performance gains over conventional digital realizations with power consumption on the order of microwatts, comparable with a single very low-resolution Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) utilized in digital receivers. To maintain performance under varying noise conditions, we also introduce a novel noise-tracking mechanism that dynamically adjusts neural parameters during transmission. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and directions toward ultra-efficient neuromorphic transceivers.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of abnormal clinical EEG: comparison of a finetuned foundation model with two deep learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used by physicians for the diagnosis of numerous neurological disorders. Due to the large volume of EEGs requiring interpretation and the specific expertise involved, artificial intelligence-based tools are being developed to assist in their visual analysis. In this paper, we compare two deep learning models (CNN-LSTM and Transformer-based) with BioSerenity-E1, a recently proposed foundation model, in the task of classifying entire EEG recordings as normal or abnormal. The three models were trained or finetuned on 2,500 EEG recordings and their performances were evaluated on two private and one public datasets: a large multicenter dataset annotated by a single specialist (dataset A composed of n = 4,480 recordings), a small multicenter dataset annotated by three specialists (dataset B, n = 198), and the Temple University Abnormal (TUAB) EEG corpus evaluation dataset (n = 276). On dataset A, the three models achieved at least 86% balanced accuracy, with BioSerenity-E1 finetuned achieving the highest balanced accuracy (89.19% [88.36-90.41]). BioSerenity-E1 finetuned also achieved the best performance on dataset B, with 94.63% [92.32-98.12] balanced accuracy. The models were then validated on TUAB evaluation dataset, whose corresponding training set was not used during training, where they achieved at least 76% accuracy. Specifically, BioSerenity-E1 finetuned outperformed the other two models, reaching an accuracy of 82.25% [78.27-87.48]. Our results highlight the usefulness of leveraging pre-trained models for automatic EEG classification: enabling robust and efficient interpretation of EEG data with fewer resources and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Beyond 1D: Vision Transformers and Multichannel Signal Images for PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.</description>

      <title>When Feedback Empowers the Uplink: Integrating Adaptive Coding with Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption and device lifetime are critical concerns for battery-constrained IoT devices. This paper introduces the Feedback-Aided Coding and Energy Transfer (FACET) framework, which synergistically combines adaptive feedback channel coding with wireless power transfer. FACET leverages the saturation effect of feedback coding, where increasing downlink power yields diminishing returns, to design a dual-purpose feedback mechanism that simultaneously guides uplink coding and replenishes device energy. We characterize the inherent tradeoff between feedback precision and harvested power, and formulate a fairness-constrained min-max optimization problem to minimize worst-case net energy consumption. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and Lagrangian duality is developed, with each subproblem admitting a closed-form solution. Simulations show that FACET nearly triples device lifetime compared to conventional feedback coding architectures, and remains robust across a wide range of power regimes. These results suggest that FACET not only improves communication efficiency but also redefines the role of feedback in energy-constrained IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Real-World Modeling of Computation Offloading for Neural Networks with Early Exits and Splits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on computation offloading of applications based on convolutional neural network (CNN) from moving devices, such as mobile robots or autonomous vehicles, to MultiAccess Edge Computing (MEC) servers via a mobile network. In order to reduce overall CNN inference time, we design and implement CNN with early exits and splits, allowing a flexible partial or full offloading of CNN inference. Through real-world experiments, we analyze an impact of the CNN inference offloading on the total CNN processing delay, energy consumption, and classification accuracy in a practical road sign recognition task. The results confirm that offloading of CNN with early exits and splits can significantly reduce both total processing delay and energy consumption compared to full local processing while not impairing classification accuracy. Based on the results of real-world experiments, we derive practical models for energy consumption and total processing delay related to offloading of CNN with early exits and splits.</description>

      <title>MONSTR: Model-Oriented Neutron Strain Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual strain, a tensor quantity, is a critical material property that impacts the overall performance of metal parts. Neutron Bragg edge strain tomography is a technique for imaging residual strain that works by making conventional hyperspectral computed tomography measurements, extracting the average projected strain at each detector pixel, and processing the resulting strain sinogram using a reconstruction algorithm. However, the reconstruction is severely ill-posed as the underlying inverse problem involves inferring a tensor at each voxel from scalar sinogram data.
  In this paper, we introduce the model-oriented neutron strain tomographic reconstruction (MONSTR) algorithm that reconstructs the 2D residual strain tensor from the neutron Bragg edge strain measurements. MONSTR is based on using the multi-agent consensus equilibrium framework for the tensor tomographic reconstruction. Specifically, we formulate the reconstruction as a consensus solution of a collection of agents representing detector physics, the tomographic reconstruction process, and physics-based constraints from continuum mechanics. Using simulated data, we demonstrate high-quality reconstruction of the strain tensor even when using very few measurements.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground UEs, by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. We first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying collision avoidance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of 6G communications, intelligent communication systems face multiple challenges, including constrained perception and response capabilities, limited scalability, and low adaptability in dynamic environments. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge technologies and practical guidance. First, we outline the background of 6G communications, review the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI, and clarify the tutorial's motivation and main contributions. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive review of the key components required for constructing LAMs. We further categorize LAMs and analyze their applicability, covering Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), and lightweight LAMs. Next, we propose a LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communications, encompassing dataset construction and both internal and external learning approaches. Building upon this, we develop an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, clarifying its core components such as planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules, as well as its interaction mechanisms. We also introduce a multi-agent framework with data retrieval, collaborative planning, and reflective evaluation for 6G. Subsequently, we provide a detailed overview of the applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios. Finally, we summarize the research challenges and future directions in current studies, aiming to support the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Learning for Cold-Start-Aware Microservice Scheduling in Dynamic Edge Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of IoT devices and their diverse workloads, container-based microservices deployed at edge nodes have become a lightweight and scalable solution. However, existing microservice scheduling algorithms often assume static resource availability, which is unrealistic when multiple containers are assigned to an edge node. Besides, containers suffer from cold-start inefficiencies during early-stage training in currently popular reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning framework that combines offline imitation learning (IL) with online Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) optimization to enable a cold-start-aware microservice scheduling with dynamic allocation for computing resources. We first formulate a delay-and-energy-aware scheduling problem and construct a rule-based expert to generate demonstration data for behavior cloning. Then, a GRU-enhanced policy network is designed in the policy network to extract the correlation among multiple decisions by separately encoding slow-evolving node states and fast-changing microservice features, and an action selection mechanism is given to speed up the convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior final performance. Compared with baselines, our algorithm improves the total objective by $50\%$ and convergence speed by $70\%$, and demonstrates the highest stability and robustness across various edge configurations.</description>

      <title>Frequency Resource Management in 6G User-Centric CFmMIMO: A Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Metaheuristic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As sixth-generation (6G) networks continue to evolve, AI-driven solutions are playing a crucial role in enabling more efficient and adaptive resource management in wireless communication. One of the key innovations in 6G is user-centric cell-free massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (UC-CFmMIMO), a paradigm that eliminates traditional cell boundaries and enhances network performance by dynamically assigning access points (APs) to users. This approach is particularly well-suited for vehicular networks, offering seamless, homogeneous, ultra-reliable, and low-latency connectivity. However, in dense networks, a key challenge lies in efficiently allocating frequency resources within a limited shared subband spectrum while accounting for frequency selectivity and the dependency of signal propagation on bandwidth. These factors make resource allocation increasingly complex, especially in dynamic environments where maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) is critical. This paper tackles these challenges by proposing a hybrid multi-user allocation strategy that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and metaheuristic optimization to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), ensure fairness, and mitigate interference within shared subbands. To assess its effectiveness, we compare this hybrid approach with two other methods: the bio-inspired Aquila Optimizer (AO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL). Our evaluation is grounded in real-world patterns and channel characteristics, utilizing the 3GPP-3D channel modeling framework (QuaDRiGa) to capture realistic propagation conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid strategy achieves a superior balance among competing objectives, underscoring the role of AI-driven resource allocation in advancing UC-CFmMIMO systems for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>MultiFormer: A Multi-Person Pose Estimation System Based on CSI and Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation based on Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising approach for non-intrusive and precise human activity monitoring, yet faces challenges including accurate multi-person pose recognition and effective CSI feature learning. This paper presents MultiFormer, a wireless sensing system that accurately estimates human pose through CSI. The proposed system adopts a Transformer based time-frequency dual-token feature extractor with multi-head self-attention. This feature extractor is able to model inter-subcarrier correlations and temporal dependencies of the CSI. The extracted CSI features and the pose probability heatmaps are then fused by Multi-Stage Feature Fusion Network (MSFN) to enforce the anatomical constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on on the public MM-Fi dataset and our self-collected dataset show that the MultiFormer achieves higher accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, especially for high-mobility keypoints (wrists, elbows) that are particularly difficult for previous methods to accurately estimate.</description>

      <title>An LiGME Regularizer of Designated Isolated Minimizers -- An Application to Discrete-Valued Signal Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a regularized least squares estimation of discrete-valued signals, we propose a Linearly involved Generalized Moreau Enhanced (LiGME) regularizer, as a nonconvex regularizer, of designated isolated minimizers. The proposed regularizer is designed as a Generalized Moreau Enhancement (GME) of the so-called sum-of-absolute-values (SOAV) convex regularizer. Every candidate vector in the discrete-valued set is aimed to be assigned to an isolated local minimizer of the proposed regularizer while the overall convexity of the regularized least squares model is maintained. Moreover, a global minimizer of the proposed model can be approximated iteratively by using a variant of the constrained LiGME (cLiGME) algorithm. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed estimation, we also propose a pair of simple modifications, called respectively an iterative reweighting and a generalized superiorization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms in a scenario of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing and imaging with distributed radio infrastructures (e.g., distributed MIMO, wireless sensor networks, multistatic radar) rely on knowledge of the positions, orientations, and clock parameters of distributed apertures. We extend a particle-based loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm to cooperatively synchronize distributed agents to anchors in space and time. Substituting marginalization over nuisance parameters with approximate but closed-form concentration, we derive an efficient estimator that bypasses the need for preliminary channel estimation and operates directly on noisy channel observations. Our algorithm demonstrates scalable, accurate spatiotemporal synchronization on simulated data.</description>

      <title>MR-ULINS: A Tightly-Coupled UWB-LiDAR-Inertial Estimator with Multi-Epoch Outlier Rejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) and the ultra-wideband (UWB) have been integrated together to achieve driftless positioning in global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environments. However, the UWB may be affected by systematic range errors (such as the clock drift and the antenna phase center offset) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals, resulting in reduced robustness. In this study, we propose a UWB-LiDAR-inertial estimator (MR-ULINS) that tightly integrates the UWB range, LiDAR frame-to-frame, and IMU measurements within the multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework. The systematic range errors are precisely modeled to be estimated and compensated online. Besides, we propose a multi-epoch outlier rejection algorithm for UWB NLOS by utilizing the relative accuracy of the LIO. Specifically, the relative trajectory of the LIO is employed to verify the consistency of all range measurements within the sliding window. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that MR-ULINS achieves a positioning accuracy of around 0.1 m in complex indoor environments with severe NLOS interference. Ablation experiments show that the online estimation and multi-epoch outlier rejection can effectively improve the positioning accuracy. Besides, MR-ULINS maintains high accuracy and robustness in LiDAR-degenerated scenes and UWB-challenging conditions with spare base stations.</description>

      <title>Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Solid State Bus-Comp: A Large-Scale and Diverse Dataset for Dynamic Range Compressor Virtual Analog Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual Analog (VA) modeling aims to simulate the behavior of hardware circuits via algorithms to replicate their tone digitally. Dynamic Range Compressor (DRC) is an audio processing module that controls the dynamics of a track by reducing and amplifying the volumes of loud and quiet sounds, which is essential in music production. In recent years, neural-network-based VA modeling has shown great potential in producing high-fidelity models. However, due to the lack of data quantity and diversity, their generalization ability in different parameter settings and input sounds is still limited. To tackle this problem, we present Solid State Bus-Comp, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for modeling the classical VCA compressor -- SSL 500 G-Bus. Specifically, we manually collected 175 unmastered songs from the Cambridge Multitrack Library. We recorded the compressed audio in 220 parameter combinations, resulting in an extensive 2528-hour dataset with diverse genres, instruments, tempos, and keys. Moreover, to facilitate the use of our proposed dataset, we conducted benchmark experiments in various open-sourced black-box and grey-box models, as well as white-box plugins. We also conducted ablation studies in different data subsets to illustrate the effectiveness of the improved data diversity and quantity. The dataset and demos are on our project page: https://www.yichenggu.com/SolidStateBusComp/.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part I: Computing with Microwave Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this two-part paper, we explore analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing and communications. In Part I of this paper, we model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, enabling the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and matrix inversion, with remarkably low computational complexity. Specifically, a matrix can be inverted with complexity growing with the square of its size. We also show how a MiLAC can be used jointly with digital operations to implement sophisticated algorithms such as the Kalman filter. To enhance practicability, we propose a design of MiLAC based on lossless impedance components, reducing power consumption and eliminating the need for costly active components. In Part II of this paper, we investigate the applications of MiLACs in wireless communications, highlighting their potential to enable future wireless systems by executing computations and beamforming in the analog domain.</description>

Abstract: Analog-domain operations offer a promising solution to accelerating signal processing and enabling future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with thousands of antennas. In Part I of this paper, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In Part II of this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic MIMO beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming enables the maximum flexibility and performance of digital beamforming, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of zero-forcing (ZF), which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. It also processes signals with fixed matrices, e.g., the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), directly in the analog domain. Numerical results show that it can perform ZF and DFT with a computational complexity reduction of up to $1.5\times 10^4$ and $4.0\times 10^7$ times, respectively, compared to digital beamforming.</description>

      <title>Revenue Optimization in Video Caching Networks with Privacy-Preserving Demand Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07872</link>

Abstract: Performance of video streaming, which accounts for most of the traffic in wireless communication, can be significantly improved by caching popular videos at the wireless edge. Determining the cache content that optimizes performance (defined via a revenue function) is thus an important task, and prediction of the future demands based on past history can make this process much more efficient. However, since practical video caching networks involve various parties (e.g., users, isp, and csp) that do not wish to reveal information such as past history to each other, privacy-preserving solutions are required. Motivated by this, we propose a proactive caching method based on users' privacy-preserving multi-slot future demand predictions -- obtained from a trained Transformer -- to optimize revenue. Specifically, we first use a privacy-preserving fl algorithm to train a Transformer to predict multi-slot future demands of the users. However, prediction accuracy is not perfect and decreases the farther into the future the prediction is done. We model the impact of prediction errors invoking the file popularities, based on which we formulate a long-term system revenue optimization to make the cache placement decisions. As the formulated problem is NP-hard, we use a greedy algorithm to efficiently obtain an approximate solution. Simulation results validate that (i) the fl solution achieves results close to the centralized (non-privacy-preserving) solution and (ii) optimization of revenue may provide different solutions than the classical chr criterion.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>
