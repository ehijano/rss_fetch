      <title>A Review of Modern Stochastic Modeling: SDE/SPDE Numerics, Data-Driven Identification, and Generative Methods with Applications in Biology and Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review maps developments in stochastic modeling, highlighting non-standard approaches and their applications to biology and epidemiology. It brings together four strands: (1) core models for systems that evolve with randomness; (2) learning key parts of those models directly from data; (3) methods that can generate realistic synthetic data in continuous time; and (4) numerical techniques that keep simulations stable, accurate, and faithful over long runs. The objective is practical: help researchers quickly see what is new, how the pieces fit together, and where important gaps remain. We summarize tools for estimating changing infection or reaction rates under noisy and incomplete observations, modeling spatial spread, accounting for sudden jumps and heavy tails, and reporting uncertainty in a way that is useful for decisions. We also highlight open problems that deserve near-term attention: separating true dynamics from noise when data are irregular; learning spatial dynamics under random influences with guarantees of stability; aligning training with the numerical method used in applications; preserving positivity and conservation in all simulations; reducing cost while controlling error for large studies; estimating rare but important events; and adopting clear, comparable reporting standards. By organizing the field around these aims, the review offers a concise guide to current methods, their practical use, and the most promising directions for future work in biology and epidemiology.s.</description>

      <title>A proof that all the sliding trajectories of generic inelastic piecewise linear dynamical systems over the torus are closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider piecewise smooth differential equations $Z_{X_-X_+}$, where $X_-$ and $X_+$ are linear vector fields in dimension 3, having the torus as discontinuity manifold. We consider that $Z_{X_-X_+}$ is an inelastic vector field over the torus. We classify the set of tangency points on the torus for certain conditions and describe the behavior of the trajectories of the sliding vector field over the torus. We prove that, under generic conditions, all the trajectories of a piecewise smooth linear inelastic vector field over the torus are closed. We also provide a result about the topological equivalence of inelastic vector fields over the torus.</description>

      <title>Inertia perturbation theory for the inertial Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inertial Kuramoto model, which is a second-order extension of the classical first-order Kuramoto model, as an inertial perturbation of the first-order Kuramoto model. We develop a quantitative Tikhonov theorem, from which we derive a new synchronization statement in the small inertia regime, with strong bounds on the limiting order parameter. We also explore the determinability of phase velocities from phase positions, which shows that the perturbation viewpoint must be limited to the small inertia regime. This paper complements our recent work (2025), where we established asymptotic phase-locking of inertial Kuramoto oscillators under generic initial conditions in the low inertia-high coupling regime.</description>

      <title>The matrix potential game and structures of self-affine sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new variant of the potential game and show that certain compact subsets of $\R^n$, including a large class of self-affine sets, are winning in our game. We prove that sets with sufficiently strong winning conditions are non-empty, provide a lower bound for their Hausdorff dimension, show that they have good intersection properties, and provide conditions under which, given $M \in \N$, they contain a homothetic copy of every set with at most $M$ elements. The applications of our game to self-affine sets are new and complement the recent work of Yavicoli et al (Math. Z. 2022 and Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN 2023) for self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>Allee Synaptic Plasticity and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural plasticity is fundamental to memory storage and retrieval in biological systems, yet existing models often fall short in addressing noise sensitivity and unbounded synaptic weight growth. This paper investigates the Allee-based nonlinear plasticity model, emphasizing its biologically inspired weight stabilization mechanisms, enhanced noise robustness, and critical thresholds for synaptic regulation. We analyze its performance in memory retention and pattern retrieval, demonstrating increased capacity and reliability compared to classical models like Hebbian and Oja's rules. To address temporal limitations, we extend the model by integrating time-dependent dynamics, including eligibility traces and oscillatory inputs, resulting in improved retrieval accuracy and resilience in dynamic environments. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical implications, offering a robust framework for modeling neural adaptation and informing advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Weakly Mixing Polygonal Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.00890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there exists a residual set of (non-rational) polygons such the billiard flow is weakly mixing with respect to the Liouville measure (on the unit tangent bundle to the billiard). This follows, via a Baire category argument, from showing that for any translation surface the product of the flows in almost every pair of directions is ergodic with respect to Lebesgue measure. This in turn is proven by showing that for every translation surface the flows in almost every pair of directions do not share non-trivial common eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Grand-canonical Thermodynamic Formalism via IFS: volume, temperature, gas pressure and grand-canonical topological pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01590v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here a dynamic model for a gas in which a variable number of particles $N \in \mathbb{N}_0 := \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ can be located at a site. This point of view leads us to the grand-canonical framework and the need for a chemical potential. The dynamics is played by the shift acting on the set of sequences $\Omega := \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$, where the alphabet is $\mathcal{A} := \{1,2,...,r\}$. Introducing new variables like the number of particles $N$ and the chemical potential $\mu$, we adapt the concept of grand-canonical partition sum of thermodynamics of gases to a symbolic dynamical setting considering a Lipschitz family of potentials $% (A_N)_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0}$, $A_N:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$. Our main results will be obtained from adapting well-known properties of the Thermodynamic Formalism for IFS with weights to our setting. In this direction, we introduce the grand-canonical-Ruelle operator: $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f)=g$, when, $\beta&gt;0,\mu&lt;0,$ and
  \medskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,g(x)= \mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}(f) (x) =\sum_{N \in \mathbb{N}_0} e^{\beta \, \mu\, N }\, \sum_{j \in \mathcal{A}} e^{- \,\beta\, A_N(jx)} f(jx). $ \medskip
  We show the existence of the main eigenvalue, an associated eigenfunction, and an eigenprobability for $\mathcal{L}_{\beta, \mu}^*$. We can show the analytic dependence of the eigenvalue on the grand-canonical potential. Considering the concept of entropy for holonomic probabilities on $\Omega\times \mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}_0}$, we relate these items with the variational problem of maximizing grand-canonical pressure. In another direction, in the appendix, we briefly digress on a possible interpretation of the concept of topological pressure as related to the gas pressure of gas thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The H\"older exponent of Anosov limit maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary word hyperbolic group and $d_{a}, a&gt;1,$ a visual metric on its Gromov boundary $\partial_{\infty}\Gamma$. For an $1$-Anosov representation $\rho:\Gamma \rightarrow \mathsf{GL}_{d}(\mathbb{K})$, where $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, we calculate the H\"older exponent of the Anosov limit map $\xi_{\rho}^1:(\partial_{\infty}\Gamma, d_{a})\rightarrow (\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{K}^d),d_{\mathbb{P}})$ of $\rho$ in terms of the moduli of eigenvalues of elements in $\rho(\Gamma)$ and the stable translation length on $\Gamma$. If $\rho$ is either irreducible or $\xi_{\rho}^1(\partial_{\infty}\Gamma)$ spans $\mathbb{K}^d$ and $\rho$ is $\{1,2\}$-Anosov, then $\xi_{\rho}^1$ attains its H\"older exponent. We also provide an analogous calculation for the exponent of the inverse limit map of $(1,1,2)$-hyperconvex representations. Finally, we exhibit examples of non semisimple $1$-Anosov representations of surface groups in $\mathsf{SL}_4(\mathbb{R})$ whose Anosov limit map in $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R}^4)$ does not attain its H\"older exponent.</description>

      <title>On the average stopping time of the Collatz map in $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Define the map $T_1$ on $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$ by $T_1(f)=\frac{f}{x}$ if $f(0)=0$ and $T_1(f)=\frac{(x+1)f+1}{x}$ if $f(0)=1$. For a non-zero polynomial $f$ let $\tau_1(f)$ denote the least natural $k$ number for which $T_1^{k}(f)=1$. Define the average stopping time to be $\rho_1(n)=\frac{\sum_{f\in \mathbb{F}_2[x], \text{deg}(f)=n }\tau_1(f)}{2^n}$. We show that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\rho_1(n)}{n}=2$, confirming a conjecture of Alon, Behajaina, and Paran. Furthermore, we give a new proof that $\tau_1(f)\in O(\text{deg}(f)^{1.5})$ for all $f\in\mathbb{F}_2[x]\setminus\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance Laws With a Time-Dependent Source Term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of one conservation law and one balance law with a time-dependent source term, and provide a comprehensive analysis of Riemann solutions, including the non-classical overcompressive delta shocks. The minimal yet representative structure of the system captures essential features of transport under density constraints and, despite its simplicity, serves as a versatile prototype for crowd-limited transport processes across diverse contexts, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. In addition to non-self-similar solutions mentioned above, the associated Riemann problem admits solution structures that traverse vacuum states ($\rho = 0$) and the critical density threshold ($\rho = \bar{\rho}$), where mobility vanishes and characteristic speed degenerates. Moreover, the explicit time dependence in the source term leads to the breakdown of self-similarity, resulting in distinct Riemann solutions over successive time intervals and highlighting the dynamic nature of the solution landscape. The theoretical findings are numerically confirmed using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>
