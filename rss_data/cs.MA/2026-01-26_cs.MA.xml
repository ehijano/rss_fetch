      <title>Computational Foundations for Strategic Coopetition: Formalizing Collective Action and Loyalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-motive multi-agent settings are rife with persistent free-riding because individual effort benefits all members equally, yet each member bears the full cost of their own contribution. Classical work by Holmstr\"om established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%). Empirical validation using published Apache HTTP Server (1995-2023) case study achieves 60/60 points, reproducing contribution patterns across formation, growth, maturation, and governance phases. Statistical significance confirmed at p&lt;0.001, Cohen's d=0.71.</description>

      <title>AMBER: A Columnar Architecture for High-Performance Agent-Based Modeling in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as an indispensable methodology for studying complex adaptive systems across the natural and social sciences. However, Python-based ABM frameworks face a fundamental tension between the accessibility that has made Python dominant in scientific computing and the performance requirements of large-scale simulations. This paper introduces AMBER, a framework that resolves this tension through a novel architectural approach: replacing the conventional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management using the Polars DataFrame library. We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations. Memory profiling reveals 30-50% reduction in peak usage compared to object-oriented frameworks. Our results establish columnar state management as a viable architectural foundation for high-performance ABM in interpreted languages.</description>

      <title>GameTalk: Training LLMs for Strategic Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic decision-making in multi-agent settings is a key challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly when coordination and negotiation must unfold over extended conversations. While recent work has explored the use of LLMs in isolated decision tasks, little attention has been given to optimizing long-term objectives through dialogue. We introduce \textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling. Our results show that GameTalk significantly outperforms untrained models, especially under reward shaping, with DPO consistently yielding the strongest gains. These findings position conversational fine-tuning as a promising path for LLMs to reason, negotiate, and act in interactive environments.</description>

      <title>SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.</description>

      <title>DMV-AVP: Distributed Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking using Autoware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the DMV-AVP System, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

      <title>DMAVA: Distributed Multi-Autonomous Vehicle Architecture Using Autoware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating and validating coordination among multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a challenging task as most existing simulation architectures are limited to single-vehicle operation or rely on centralized control. This paper presents a Distributed Multi-AV Architecture (DMAVA) that enables synchronized, real-time autonomous driving simulation across multiple physical hosts. Each vehicle runs its own complete AV stack and operates independently from other AVs. The vehicles in the simulation maintain synchronized coordination through a low-latency data-centric communication layer. The proposed system integrates ROS 2 Humble, Autoware Universe, AWSIM Labs, and Zenoh to support concurrent execution of multiple Autoware stacks within a shared Unity-based environment. Experiments conducted on multiple-host configurations demonstrate stable localization, reliable inter-host communication, and fully synchronized closed-loop control. The DMAVA also serves as a foundation for Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking, demonstrating its extensibility toward higher-level cooperative autonomy.

      <title>Mixture-of-Models: Unifying Heterogeneous Agents via N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.</description>

      <title>Emergent Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems via Pressure Fields and Temporal Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current multi-agent LLM frameworks rely on explicit orchestration patterns borrowed from human organizational structures: planners delegate to executors, managers coordinate workers, and hierarchical control flow governs agent interactions. These approaches suffer from coordination overhead that scales poorly with agent count and task complexity. We propose a fundamentally different paradigm inspired by natural coordination mechanisms: agents operate locally on a shared artifact, guided only by pressure gradients derived from measurable quality signals, with temporal decay preventing premature convergence. We formalize this as optimization over a pressure landscape and prove convergence guarantees under mild conditions. Empirically, on meeting room scheduling across 1,350 trials, pressure-field coordination outperforms all baselines: 48.5% aggregate solve rate versus 12.6% for conversation-based coordination, 1.5% for hierarchical control, and 0.4% for sequential and random baselines (all pairwise comparisons p &lt; 0.001). Temporal decay is essential: disabling it reduces solve rate by 10 percentage points. On easy problems, pressure-field achieves 86.7% solve rate. The approach maintains consistent performance from 1 to 4 agents. Implicit coordination through shared pressure gradients outperforms explicit hierarchical control, suggesting that constraint-driven emergence offers a simpler and more effective foundation for multi-agent AI.</description>

      <title>MACTAS: Self-Attention-Based Inter-Agent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Action-Value Function Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication method that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The method can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition algorithm and can be viewed as an orthogonal extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents, which makes it scalable to large systems. Experimental results on the SMACv2 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of maps. makes it scalable to large systems.
