      <title>Non-perturbative thermal QCD at very high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a recently introduced strategy to study non-perturbatively thermal QCD up to temperatures of the order of the electro-weak scale, combining step scaling techniques and shifted boundary conditions. The former allow to renormalize the theory for a range of scales which spans several orders of magnitude with a moderate computational cost. Shifted boundary conditions avoid the need for the zero temperature subtraction in the Equation of State. As a consequence, the simulated lattices do not have to accommodate two very different scales, the pion mass and the temperature. Effective field theory arguments guarantee that finite volume effects can be kept under control safely. As a first application of this strategy, we present the results of the computation of the hadronic screening spectrum in QCD with $N_f=3$ flavours of massless quarks for temperatures from $T\sim 1$ GeV up to $\sim 160$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Computing real-time quantum path integrals on Sewed, almost-Lefschetz thimbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to compute real-time path integrals numerically, by Monte-Carlo sampling on near-Lefschetz thimbles. We present a collection of new tools, which together provide an alternative to existing methods such as the Generalised thimble. These involve a convenient coordinate parameterization of the thimble, direct numerical integration along a radial coordinate into an effective path integral weight and locally deforming the Lefschetz thimble using its Gaussian (non-interacting theory) counterpart in a region about the critical point. We apply this to quantum mechanics, identify possible pitfalls and benefits, and benchmark its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations for the hadronic VVA correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive two types of dispersion relations for the hadronic vector-vector-axial-vector (VVA) correlator: one in generic three-point kinematics with fixed photon virtualities, the second in the kinematic limit of one soft photon. The VVA correlator enters in the electroweak contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment and it also emerges as the leading term in the operator-product expansion for hadronic light-by-light scattering in the limit of two large photon momenta. Previously, this correlator was only described in terms of hadronic models. Our new dispersive treatments are in analogy to the established and the newly proposed dispersive approaches to hadronic light-by-light. The VVA correlator allows us to investigate the relation between the two types of dispersion relations in a simpler example and to elucidate the reshuffling of different hadronic contributions in this comparison. As a byproduct, we reduce the theoretical uncertainties on the first-family VVA contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment by combining the dispersive representation with both asymptotic and low-energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Exact relations between running of $\alpha_s$ and $\alpha$ in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD-like theories we derive the (all-order) exact equations relating the renormalization group behaviour of the strong and electromagnetic couplings and prove that they are valid in the HD+MSL renormalization prescription. In particular, the $\beta$-function of ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD can be expressed in terms of the Adler $D$-function. If all favors have the same absolute value of the electromagnetic charges, it is also possible to write a simple relation between the $\beta$-functions for the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. In this particular case there is a special renormalization group invariant relation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the proton-antiproton scattering using a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the last experimental and theoretical advances in the analysis of possible baryonium resonances, the $X(1835)$ and their partners, we perform a constituent-quark-model based coupled-channels calculation of the proton-antiproton scattering in order to analyze the possible existence of bound states or near-threshold structures. The used $N\overline N$ potential is derived from a $G$-parity transformation of the quark-model-based $NN$ interaction which has described well deuteron properties, $NN$ phase shifts, and even hadron-hadron phenomenology. The additional $N\overline N$ annihilation is taken into account by a complex phenomenological potential whose real part is generated by one-pion and one-gluon exchange annihilation potentials and its imaginary part is an energy-independent potential of Gaussian form. Then, all the parameters of the interaction are constrained by the $NN$ sector except those determining the imaginary part of the annihilation potential. Our study concludes that the nucleon-antinucleon dynamics is complex and rich in scattering singularities near the proton-antiproton and neutron-antineutron thresholds.</description>

      <title>First-order electroweak phase transitions: a nonperturbative update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study first-order electroweak phase transitions nonperturbatively, assuming any particles beyond the Standard Model are sufficiently heavy to be integrated out at the phase transition. Utilising high temperature dimensional reduction, we perform lattice Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate the main quantities characterising the transition: the critical temperature, the latent heat, the surface tension and the bubble nucleation rate, updating and extending previous lattice studies. We focus on the region where the theory gives first-order phase transitions due to an effective reduction in the Higgs self-coupling and give a detailed comparison with perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>$B_s \to K\ell\nu$ form factors from lattice QCD with domain-wall heavy quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on our on-going study of the $B_s \to K\ell\nu$ decay in $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD. We employ fully relativistic setup in which the M\"obius domain-wall action is used for all quark flavors. The lattice cutoff is $a^{-1} \sim 2.5$ GeV, where we take bottom quark masses up to $m_Q\!&lt;\!0.7a^{-1}$ in order to control discretization errors. We present preliminary results for the relevant form factors extracted from correlator ratios by inspecting their ground state saturation.</description>

      <title>Estimates of Lee-Yang zeros and critical point for finite isospin densities in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD using unbiased exponential resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimated using the unbiased exponential resummation formalism on (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical quark masses on $\Nt=8$ lattice, we present the first calculations of Lee-Yang zeros of QCD partition function in complex isospin chemical potential $\muI$ plane. From these zeros, we obtain the resummed estimate of radius of convergence, which we compare with the corresponding ratio and Mercer-Roberts estimates of the subsequent Taylor series expansions of the first three cumulants. We also illustrate a comparative study between the resummed and the Taylor series results of different partition function cumulants for real and imaginary values of $\muI$, discussing the behaviour of different expansion orders within and beyond the so-obtained resummed estimate of radius of convergence. We show that the reweighting factor and phasefactor begin to attain zero from this resummed estimate of radius of convergence. In this paper, we crosscheck this resummation methodology in baryochemical potential $\muB$ and affirm its validity in finite statistics limit. We also briefly compare this method with Taylor and \pade resummation results in $\muB$. We also re-establish this resummed radius of convergence can capture the onset of overlap problem for finite real $\muI$ simulations.</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark hybrid model, modular transformation and Roberge-Weiss transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of modular transformations, we reformulate the recently proposed hadron-quark hybrid model when the imaginary baryonic chemical potential is introduced. As a result, we can consider the torus, which is characterized by the complex number densities of baryons (antibaryons) and quarks (antiquarks). We apply this model to analyze the Roberge-Weiss transition. It is shown that the torus vanishes at the baryonic chemical potential where the Roberge-Weiss transition appears because the number density of baryons (antibaryons) is not linearly independent of the number density of quarks (antiquarks). When the temperature T is lower than the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW, the torus shrinks smoothly to the one-dimensional object at the Roberge-Weiss transition point, but the discontinuity does not appear. On the other hand, the discontinuity of the geometrical object appears when T&gt;TRW. We also calculate the modulus of the torus and transform it into the fundamental region. The transformed moduli are symmetric below TRW, but the symmetry is broken above TRW.</description>
