      <title>Mechanical Stability of 2D Ti2COx MXenes Under Compression Using Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compressive and post-buckling behavior of Ti2C and Ti2CO2 MXene nanosheets is studied using large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Nanosheets are subjected to uniaxial, biaxial, and shear loads to investigate their buckling modes, atomic-level deformation mechanisms, and failure characteristics. The results indicate that classical continuum mechanics significantly overestimates the buckling strains. Nanosheets exhibit higher resistance to buckling along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction. Although atomic-scale defects reduce the buckling stress, they influence deformation only locally and do not alter the global buckling mode shapes. Lateral confinement pressure, such as that caused by polymerization-induced shrinkage in MXene-polymer composites, substantially increases the buckling stress. Oxygen surface termination increases the buckling stress from approximately 1 GPa to 3.5 GPa and reduces directional anisotropy in the elastic response. Under large compressive strains, Ti2CO2 nanosheets fracture, whereas Ti2C nanosheets retain structural integrity at strains exceeding 0.35. Atomistic analysis reveals opposite stress states in the top and bottom Ti layers due to curvature-induced strain gradients. Under biaxial compression, the nanosheet buckles in a dome-like shape, whereas shear loads produce elliptical deflection modes. The presented findings stimulate future studies on MXene morphological transformations, such as the development of nanotube, nanoscroll, and folded architectures.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Supported Nanoparticles: Decoupling Energy Accuracy from Structural Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supported nanoparticle catalysts are widely used in the chemical industry. Computational modeling of supported nanoparticles based on density functional theory (DFT) often involves structural searches of stable local minimum energy configurations and molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature. These are computationally demanding tasks that are intractable within DFT for large systems. In the last two decades, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been successfully used to substantially increase the size and time scales accessible to simulations that retain DFT accuracy. However, training reliable MLIPs is non-trivial as it requires many costly DFT calculations. Recently, several universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) have been developed, which are trained on large datasets that cover a wide range of molecules and materials. Here, we benchmark the accuracy and the efficiency of these uMLIPs in describing Cu nanoparticles supported on Al$_2$O$_3$ surfaces against our domain-specific DP-UniAlCu model. We find that the MACE-OMAT can reproduce reasonably well the low-energy configurations found in global optimization at an energy accuracy comparable to DP-UniAlCu. Interestingly, the MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M model, which exhibits larger deviations in the binding energies, can find even more stable configurations than the other two models in some supported nanoparticle sizes, showing its capability in structure exploration. For MD simulations, MACE-OMAT and MatterSim-v1.0.0-1M can qualitatively reproduce the mean-squared displacements of Cu atoms (MSD$_\mathrm{Cu}$) predicted by DP-UniAlCu, albeit at roughly two orders of magnitude higher cost. We demonstrate that the uMLIPs can be very useful in simulating supported nanoparticles even without any fine-tuning, though their reduced efficiency remains a limiting factor for large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Mapping vacancy and bonding electron distributions around aluminium nanovoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All materials have defects and many contain nanostructures, both of which disrupt chemical bonding - the basis of materials properties. No experimental measurements of bonding electron distributions associated with defects and nanostructures have ever been possible. We present a method enabling such measurements and interrogate nanovoids surrounded by vacancies - the most fundamental of nanostructures and defects - in aluminium. We measure the volume of a vacancy with 3% uncertainty and map vacancy concentrations surrounding nanovoids with nanometre resolution in three dimensions where previously only two-dimensional mapping was possible. We discover that radiation-damaged voids can "heal". Our bonding measurements are depth-resolved, vacancy-sensitive, and agree with density functional theory. This work opens bonding electron density measurements to inhomogeneous nanostructured multi-phased materials so that the electronic origins of phenomena such as strengthening, weakening, interface functionality, solute diffusion and phase transformations within them may be revealed.</description>

      <title>Phonon density of states of silica (SiO2) nanopore via molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive computational investigation of the vibration density of states (VDOS) of a silica nanopore, systematically evaluating a range of force fields against inelastic neutron scattering results. We analyze the influence of temperature, crustal structure, and surface-adsorbed water molecules on the nanopore's structural and dynamic properties. We performed classical molecular dynamics simulations of nanopore and bulk silica, and used density functional theory (DFT) calculations for bulk silica for comparison. The resulting VDOS shows relatively good agreement with DFT and experimental data. The temperature has a relatively low effect on the dry nanopore. The inclusion of H2O molecules significantly affects the VDOS. The low-energy modes are dominated by H2O VDOS and increase with loading. This work is an essential step towards characterizing silica nanopores via molecular dynamics and provides a valuable reference for experimental comparison with X-ray and neutron scattering VDOS results.</description>

      <title>Platonic representation of foundation machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are trained on overlapping chemical spaces, yet their latent representations remain model-specific. Here, we show that independently developed MLIPs exhibit statistically consistent geometric organisation of atomic environments, which we term the Platonic representation. By projecting embeddings relative to a set of atomic anchors, we unify the latent spaces of seven MLIPs (spanning equivariant, non-equivariant, conservative, and non-conservative architectures) into a common metric space that preserves chemical periodicity and structural invariants. This unified framework enables direct cross-model optimal transport, interpretable embedding arithmetic, and the detection of representational biases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that geometric distortions in this space can indicate physical prediction failures, including symmetry breaking and incorrect phonon dispersions. Our results show that the latent spaces of diverse MLIPs present consistent statistical geometry shaped by shared physical and chemical constraints, suggesting that the Platonic representation offers a practical route toward interoperable, comparable, and interpretable foundation models for materials science.</description>

      <title>External-field-induced transition from altermagnetic metal to fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal in monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2O}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets and fully-compensated ferrimagnets are two canonical classes of zero-net-moment magnets. An altermagnetic (AM) half-metal cannot exist due to its AM spin splitting, while a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) metal seems impossible to realize because both spin channels remain gapless. Here, we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be realized by breaking the rotational or mirror symmetry that links two spin-opposite magnetic atoms in an AM metal. We further demonstrate that charge-carrier doping is fundamentally unable to generate a net magnetic moment in an altermagnet, whereas such a net moment can be readily induced in a fully-compensated ferrimagnet. We use the AM monolayer $\mathrm{Cr_2O}$ as a concrete example to validate our proposal. Either electric field or uniaxial strain can break the $S_{4z}$ symmetry of $\mathrm{Cr_2O}$, thereby inducing a transition from an AM metal to an FC-FIM metal. Uniaxial strain plus carrier doping creates a net moment in an altermagnet, and the so-called piezomagnetism is essentially a strain-driven switch from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. By analogy, we advance the concept of electromagnetism: an electric field drives the transition from altermagnetism to fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, and subsequent charge-carrier doping stabilizes a net magnetization. Our work provides a roadmap for further exploring the connection and distinction between altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, and confirms the feasibility of FC-FIM metal.</description>

      <title>Awakening catalytically active surface of BaRuO3 thin film for alkaline hydrogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic reconstruction of surfaces during electrochemical reactions plays a crucial role in determining the performance of electrocatalysts. However, because reconstructions occur at the atomic level, direct observation and elucidation of the underlying mechanism are challenging for conventional powder type catalysts with ill defined lattices. In this study, the catalytically active surface of 3C BaRuO3 (BRO) epitaxial thin films emerges upon the dynamic introduction of surface Ru clusters, for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the mass activity at overpotential 100 mV, the intrinsic HER performance increases dramatically from 0.11 to 7.72 A/mg immediately after the initial HER cycle and eventually saturates at 1.05 A/mg after continuous operation. The formation of Ru clusters on the catalyst surface, driven by selective Ba leaching under alkaline HER conditions, is observed experimentally. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that HER activity increased with enhanced H* adsorption owing to the dynamic Ru6 cluster formation. A strategy for stabilizing the 'awakened' active surface of BRO is further proposed by validating that the atomic-scale control of the film thickness can effectively maintain the highly active state. This study offers fundamental insights into the design and stabilization of the highly active Ru-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline HER.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of A15 Nb3Al superconducting thin films for application in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A15 superconductors are distinguished by their high critical temperatures, magnetic fields, and current-carrying capabilities. Among them, Nb$_3$Al is of particular interest for superconducting quantum circuits as a means to extend device operating temperatures, provided that its electrodynamic properties are well understood. Here, we report on the synthesis of Nb$_3$Al thin films by magnetron co-sputtering followed by rapid thermal processing, yielding superconducting transition temperatures above 16~K. Microwire devices patterned from these films exhibit a coherence length of $3.2\,\mathrm{nm}$ and superfluid densities as low as $1.1\times 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, suggesting that Nb$_3$Al may enable high kinetic inductance in thinner films. Coplanar waveguide resonators fabricated on Nb$_3$Al demonstrate single-photon internal quality factors up to $2.26\times 10^{5}$. These results establish Nb$_3$Al as a promising material platform for the development of superconducting quantum circuits operating at elevated temperatures, contingent on appropriate control of interfacial chemistry and surface morphology.</description>

      <title>Direct demonstration of electric chirality control in a helimagnetic YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by spin-polarized neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spiral handedness of magnetic moments, referred to as chirality, gives rise to emergent electromagnetic phenomena in helimagnets. In insulating helimagnets, known as multiferroics, the cycloidal spin structure induces electric polarization by utilizing the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism. Spin-polarized neutron diffraction experiments, which directly probe circular spin arrangements, clearly demonstrated that an electric field controlled the chirality in multiferroic helimagnets. On the other hand, it was unclear until recently how the chirality could be controlled in metallic helimagnets where a large electric field cannot be applied, while the chirality control technique in metallic helimagnets should enable the exploration of chirality-dependent spintronic functionalities. Recently, Jiang et al. succeeded in controlling the chirality of a spiral structure by the simultaneous application of a magnetic field and electric current in a metallic helimagnet, utilizing the nonreciprocal electronic transport as an indirect probe of chirality, highlighting the need for a neutron diffraction experiment that directly probes the chirality. Here, we directly demonstrate the chirality control in a metallic helimagnet YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by means of spin-polarized neutron diffraction, which should give rise to a firm basis for the development of future helimagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Compressional rate-dependent stability of ammonia hydrates crystallized from water-rich ammonia-water solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the crystallization pathways of water-rich ammonia-water (NH3-H2O) solutions and the stability of ammonia hydrates is key to unraveling the behavior of complex hydrogen-bonding networks as well as for planetary interior modelling. Yet, there are still inconsistencies in the crystallization sequence reported upon pressure-induced crystallization of H2O-rich NH3-H2O solutions at room temperature. Here, we investigate the effect of compression rates on the crystallization pathways of 25 wt% NH3 aqueous solutions at room temperature using dynamically compressed diamond anvil cells (dDAC) coupled with time-resolved X-ray diffraction. We show that compression rates exceeding 0.5 GPa/sec promote direct crystallization of a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase (DMA') with possible AMH stoichiometry coexisting with H2O ice VII, while rates below 0.2 GPa/sec stabilize monoclinic NH3-rich AHH-II and ice VII phases. Intermediate rates between 0.2-0.5 GPa/sec produce a mixture of both hydrates alongside ice VII, hence demonstrating the role of compression rate on the crystallization sequence of ammonia solutions. The compression behavior and phase stability of the distinct phase assemblies (AHH-II/DMA' + ice VII) are investigated further to place constraints on the composition of the DMA' phase, the effect of ice VII on the compressibility of ammonia hydrates, and the plausible incorporation of NH3 impurities within the lattice of high-pressure ice phases.</description>

      <title>Mode-resolved logarithmic quasiballistic heat transport in thin silicon layers: Semianalytic and Boltzmann transport analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium phonon transport driven by nanoscale hotspot heating in silicon device layers governs heat dissipation in advanced microelectronics and underscores the need for a better microscopic understanding of such processes. Yet the origin of the frequently observed logarithmic (ln) dependence of the apparent thermal response on hotspot size in crystalline silicon, and the role of individual phonon modes in this regime, remain unclear. Here, we develop a semianalytical, mode-resolved framework in the spectral phonon mean free path (MFP) domain and validate it against a full-phonon-dispersion Boltzmann transport model for heat removal from a 10 x 10 nm^2 hotspot in a thin Si layer (thicknesses of 41, 78, and 177 nm) representative of a silicon-on-insulator transistor. We show that ln-type quasiballistic scaling arises only for modes that lie on a log-uniform conductivity plateau and are diffusive-side or quasiballistic with respect to the hotspot size, whereas fully ballistic long-MFP modes contribute a saturated, nonlogarithmic background, leading to extremely slow suppression of their heat-carrying capability. The resulting phonon-modal nonlocal spectrum establishes spectral selection rules for ln-regime transport in confined Si and provides a compact basis for incorporating mode-selective quasiballistic corrections into continuum thermal models and for interpreting phonon-resolved thermometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Revealing interstitial energetics in Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy via universal machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of light interstitial elements in multicomponent alloys remains challenging due to the complexity of local chemical environments and the high computational cost of first-principles calculations. Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability.</description>

      <title>Prussian Blue and Prussian Blue Analogs as Emerging Memristive Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) and related organic materials are promising platforms for next-generation memory and energy-storage technologies due to their redox activity, ionic mobility, and compatibility with low-cost and scalable fabrication. Electrodeposited Prussian Blue (PB) and Prussian White (PW) thin films show robust resistive switching with ON/OFF ratios from one to three orders of magnitude in both bipolar and unipolar modes. Structural and spectroscopic analyses reveal homogeneous films with well-defined grain boundaries and ionic pathways that enable filamentary conduction. Current-voltage measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and quantum transport modeling indicate switching mechanisms governed by ohmic or space-charge-limited conduction, driven by potassium-ion migration and reversible redox processes. PB-based devices also exhibit conductance quantization with discrete steps at integer and half-integer multiples of G0, consistent with ballistic electron transport through atomic-scale channels. Complementary studies on perylene-based liquid crystals and FeHCF on graphene oxide highlight the versatility of PBAs for memory and supercapacitor applications. Together, these results demonstrate the multifunctionality and scalability of PBAs for future ReRAM, neuromorphic computing, multilevel memory, cryptographic hardware, and high-performance energy-storage devices.</description>

      <title>Suppression of stripe-ordered structural phases in monolayer IrTe$_2$ by a gold substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-assisted exfoliation of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as an efficient route to isolating large-area monolayer crystals, yet the influence of the supporting metal substrate on their intrinsic properties remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate successful gold-assisted exfoliation of monolayer IrTe$_2$ up to the millimeter scale. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), combined with first-principles calculations, reveals that the low-energy electronic structure closely resembles that of a freestanding monolayer 1T-IrTe$_2$. We find that quasi-covalent hybridization together with substrate-induced strain leads to only modest modifications of the electronic bands. Although strain contributes to phase stability, it is essentially hybridization that drives the stabilization of the 1T-phase of the monolayer IrTe$_2$ by suppressing stripe-ordered phase transitions. These results establish gold-assisted exfoliation as a robust route to prepare a large-area monolayer IrTe$_2$ and highlight the role of metal-substrate interaction in engineering 2D materials with tailored structural phases.</description>

      <title>Improving 2D-ness to enhance thermopower in oxide superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport dynamics of itinerant charge carriers and their interactions with the environment. For two-dimensional oxide thermoelectrics, predominantly represented by doped SrTiO3-based superlattices, reduced spatial dimensions and increased effective mass are known to enhance thermopower (S). However, because of their large effective Bohr radius resulting from their high dielectric constant, SrTiO3-based systems have limitations in exhibiting the 2D characteristic. Here, we focus on EuTiO3 as an alternative perovskite platform in which fractional LaxEu1-xTiO3/EuTiO3 artificial superlattices demonstrate the improvement in 2D nature for the dimensionality-induced improvement of S. We observed a quasi-2D thermopower S2D of -950 uV K-1 and S2D/S3D of ~20 resulting from the improved 2D confinement. Thermopower measurements, combined with hybrid density functional theory calculations, show the enhanced S originates from the confinement of Ti 3dxy-states within the LaxEu1-xTiO3 layers and the associated increase in the 2D density of states. In detail, a smaller effective Bohr radius and modified electronic band structures, in conjunction with the presence of the Eu 4f-states in EuTiO3 which modified the local electronic potential and strengthened the spatial confinement of Ti 3d-states. This approach to improving the dimensional confinement establishes a small effective Bohr radius and Eu 4f-state assisted 2D confinement provides valuable insights into the design of high-performance applications in artificial oxide superlattices.</description>

      <title>In situ mapping of indentation-induced densification and cracking in vitreous silica by nanofocus X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical strength of oxide glasses is greatly reduced by surface flaws that form during processing and use. Instrumented indentation can mimic such real-life damage events and induce flaws and cracking under controlled conditions. At the same time, instrumented indentation allows for systematic examination of the deformation and structural changes of the regions of the glass being indented. However, structural probing is nearly always performed after rather than during the sharp contact event, limiting our understanding of the indentation process. To overcome this, we here demonstrate the use of nanofocus X-ray scattering experiments to probe the local mechanical and structural response of vitreous silica during indentation. Two-dimensional mapping of the scattering pattern in the zone below a sharp diamond wedge indenter reveals local changes in the atomic structure and density as well as cracking behavior. These in situ experiments during indentation reveal the formation and evolution of the densification zone and cracking with nanoscale resolution. Understanding the interplay between structural densification and cracking behavior in glasses is deepened through this work, which is crucial for the development of more damage-resistant and thus stronger glasses as well as fundamental understanding of glass deformation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exe.py: Ab initio fine structure parameters for trigonal defect qubits within the E$\otimes$e Jahn-Teller case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal solid-state defects are often subjects of spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by the $E\otimes e$ Jahn-Teller effect, reflecting strong electron-phonon coupling. These systems, particularly paramagnetic defect qubits in solids are central for quantum technology applications, where accurate knowledge of their fine-structure parameters $-$ shaped by the complex interplay of spin-orbit and electron-phonon interactions $-$ is essential. We introduce the $\mathtt{Exe.py}$ code part of the $\mathtt{jahn {\text -} teller {\text -} dynamics}$ package, a Python code that implements the first-principles approach of [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021063 (2018)] to accurately compute the spin-orbit-phonon entanglement in trigonal defects utilizing the output from density functional theory calculations (DFT). By employing $\Delta$SCF calculations, the method extends naturally to excited states and predicts fine-structure parameters of zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), including Zeeman shifts under external magnetic fields. The approach is applicable not only to solid-state defects but also to Jahn-Teller active trigonal molecules such as the $X$CH$_3$ family. We demonstrate the capabilities of Exe.py through applications to negatively charged Group-IV$-$vacancy (G4V) defects in diamond: SiV$^-$, GeV$^-$, SnV$^-$, PbV$^-$ and the neutral N$_3$V$^0$ defect in diamond, and the CH$_3$O methoxy molecule.</description>

      <title>Angle and time-resolved polarization change induced by Kerr effect in amorphous and crystalline SiO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the polarization change of a beam reflected from the surface of both crystalline alpha and amorphous SiO2 samples while they are photo-excited by an intense light pulse, at intensities above the nonlinear excitation threshold yet below the damage threshold. The polarization change varies with the angle between the polarization of pump and probe light, but is found to be independent of their orientation relative to the crystal axes. This behavior differs between the reflected and transmitted beams, and can be modeled by taking into account a birefringence induced by the electric field of the pump. These polarization-change effects can be very strong, with polarization rotation exceeding 90{\deg}, at pump intensities well below the damage threshold. We also observe a markedly different behavior of the reflected beam depending on whether the material is crystalline or amorphous.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-driven phonon confinement in 2D halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum confinement not only reshapes electronic states but also reorganizes the vibrational landscape of low-dimensional semiconductors. In halide perovskites, however, the role of confinement in governing symmetry effects on vibrational modes has remained unresolved. Here we synthesize 2D CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with atomically defined thicknesses for 2-5 monolayers (MLs) and perform exciton absorption and emission analysis, crystalline phase determination, and phonon analysis. The lowest dimensional structure (2 MLs) reveal a co-existence of cubic and orthorhombic structure, energetically converging to orthorhombic for 3 MLs and beyond. Through polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles theory for 2-5 MLs, a striking symmetry contrast is found: B1g modes intensify and evolve in line with the phonon-confinement model, while Ag modes deviate, reflecting their distinct spatial localization. First principles calculations show that B1g vibrational modes largely reside in the xy-plane, Pb-Br-Pb units connect octahedra along the xy-direction with increased lattice dynamics as inner layers accumulate, whereas A1g vibrations couple to out-of-plane distortions and remain susceptible to surface disorder and finite-size effects. This symmetry-driven dichotomy provides a general framework for understanding phonon localization in layered halide perovskites. Beyond mechanism, we establish Raman fingerprints, particularly the A1g/B1g intensity ratio in cross-polarized geometry, as a calibrated, non-destructive metrology for 2D nanoplatelet thickness through 2-5 MLs. These results bridge electronic and phonon confinement and highlight symmetry engineering as a route to understand and control phonons, excitons, and their interactions in low-dimensional optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Size-effects on shift-current in layered CuInP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics have recently emerged as a promising avenue for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. Due to the intrinsic absence of inversion symmetry, 2D ferroelectrics exhibit bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which relies on hot, non-thermalized photo-excited carriers to generate a photo-induced current with enhanced performances thanks to efficient charge separation mechanisms. The absence of a required p-n junction architecture makes these materials particularly attractive for nanoscale energy harvesting. Recent studies have reported enhanced BPVE in nanometer-thick CuInP$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric embedded between two graphene wafers, driven by relatively strong polarization and reduced dimensionality. Short circuit photocurrent density values have been observed to reach up to mA/cm$^2$. In this paper, we demonstrate that the shift-current mechanism alone cannot fully account for these high conductivity values, suggesting that additional mechanisms may play a significant role. Furthermore, our work confirms the existence of a strong size effect, which drastically reduces the shift-conductivity response in the bulk limit, in agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-enabled interpretation of tribological deformation patterns in large-scale MD data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become indispensable for exploring tribological deformation patterns at the atomic scale. However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) Diagrams to rationalize the nucleation and quenchability of metastable $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ is a promising solid-state electrolyte with the highest ionic conductivity among its polymorphs. However, its formation presents a thermodynamic paradox: the $\alpha$-phase is the equilibrium phase at high temperature and transforms to the stable $\gamma$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ polymorph when cooled to room temperature; however, $\alpha$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ can be synthesized and quenched in a metastable state via rapid heating at relatively low temperatures. The origin of this synthesizability and anomalous stability has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this paradox by establishing a comprehensive time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, constructed from a computational temperature-size phase diagram and experimental high-time-resolution isothermal measurements. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that at the nanoscale, the $\alpha$-phase is stabilized by its low surface energy, which drastically lowers the nucleation barrier across a wide temperature range. This size-dependent stabilization is directly visualized using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, capturing the rapid nucleation of nano-sized $\alpha$-phase and its subsequent slow transformation. This work presents a generalizable framework that integrates thermodynamic and kinetic factors for understanding nucleation and phase transformation mechanisms, providing a rational strategy for the targeted synthesis of functional metastable materials.</description>

      <title>Relating the dynamics of photo de-mixing in mixed bromide-iodide perovskites to ionic and electronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of reversible de-mixing phenomena in mixed-halide perovskites under illumination is one of the most challenging as well as intriguing aspects of this class of materials. On the one hand, it poses critical constraints to the compositional space that allows reliable design of absorbers for perovskite photovoltaics. On the other hand, it holds potential for the development of novel optoionic devices where an ionic response is triggered via optical stimuli. Funda-mental questions about the origin of such photo de-mixing process remain unanswered, both in terms of its mechanism as well as thermodynamic description. Here, we relate in-situ measurements of ionic and electronic transport of mixed bromide-iodide perovskite thin films performed during photo de-mixing with the evolution of their optical and morpho-logical properties. The results point to the definition of different stages of the de-mixing process which, based on micros-copy and spectroscopic measurements, we assign to regimes of spinodal decomposition and nucleation of quasi-equilibrium iodide- and bromide-rich phases. Combined with density functional theory calculations, we explore the role of dimensionality in the mechanism and reversibility of photo de-mixing and dark re-mixing processes, referring to elec-tronic and ionic contributions to the de-mixing driving force. Additionally, our data emphasizes the role of the surface, as significantly different de-mixing dynamics, in terms of extent and reversibility, are observed for films with or without encapsulation. Our comprehensive analysis of transport, phase and optical properties of mixed-halide perovskites pro-vides guidelines for future materials design as well as for the more general fundamental understanding of light-induced ionic phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for Predicting Glass-Forming Ability in Ternary Alloy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the glass-forming ability (GFA) of chemical compositions remains a fundamental challenge in materials science, especially for oxide glasses with broad compositional diversity. Traditional empirical and thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear factors governing vitrification. In this study, we applied two ensemble machine learning algorithms-Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)-to the glass_ternary_hipt dataset to predict the GFA of ternary oxide glasses directly from composition-derived descriptors. Both models achieved excellent predictive accuracy (R^2 &gt; 0.92, MAE &lt; 0.04), confirming that GFA is learnable from compositional features alone. Feature importance analysis revealed that electronegativity variance, atomic size mismatch, and valence electron descriptors are the most influential factors, while cohesive energy and ionic radius provided secondary contributions. These chemically interpretable features align with established theories of glass formation, thereby bridging predictive performance with physical understanding. The novelty of this work lies in systematically extending ML-based predictive modeling to ternary oxide glasses, a class less studied compared to metallic and binary systems. Our results demonstrate that ensemble learning not only enables accurate GFA prediction but also provides actionable insights for designing new glass compositions with enhanced stability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and moir\'e Proximity Effects in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 Trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating magnetic order to moir\'e superlattices is of significant scientific and technological interest. Based on first-principles calculations, we study the interplay of magnetic proximity and moir\'e proximity in WSe2/WSe2/CrI3 trilayers with different stackings and twist angles. Large valley splitting is observed due to redistribution of the exciton charge density across layers via a super-exchange-like mechanism, and its electric-field dependence bears similarity to electrically tunable and valley-selective Feshbach resonances. The valley splitting can be magnified in moir\'e superlattices owing to the superposition of Umklapp excitons folded from moir\'e minibands, yielding spatially modulated and enhanced magnetic proximity. The moir\'e proximity effect is demonstrated via an imprinted moir\'e potential on CrI3 layer and its feedback to the direct moir\'e potential on WSe2 bilayers is observed. The cooperation between the direct and imprinted moir\'e potentials is shown to yield novel topological and correlated states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among van der Waals crystals, transition metal trihalide VI3 has driven attention for its magnetic and orbital properties. However, its chemical instability under ambient conditions make its exploitation challenging for technological implementation. In this context, here we show how synchrotron radiation soft X-rays partially restore stoichiometric chemical and electronic properties of VI3 crystals. By combining X-ray absorption and X-ray photoemission spectroscopies, we show as-cleaved and aged (in ultra-high vacuum conditions) chemical degradation of VI3 crystal surface, with the formation of vanadates, and its, at least partial, recovery under high-flux soft X-ray beam exposure, revealing that superficial hygroscopic contamination couples relatively weakly to the crystal surface.</description>

      <title>Adsorption energies are necessary but not sufficient to identify good catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a core technology for green chemical synthesis and electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis is central to decarbonization strategies aimed at combating climate change. In this context, computational and machine learning driven catalyst discovery has emerged as a major research focus. These approaches frequently use the thermodynamic overpotential, calculated from adsorption free energies of reaction intermediates, as a key parameter in their analysis. In this paper, we explore the large-scale applicability of such overpotential estimates for identifying good catalyst candidates by using datasets from the Open Catalyst Project (OC20 and OC22). We start by quantifying the uncertainty in predicting adsorption energies using \textit{ab initio} methods and find that $\sim$0.3-0.5 eV is a conservative estimate for a single adsorption energy prediction. We then compute the overpotential of all materials in the OC20 and OC22 datasets for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. We find that while the overpotential allows the identification of known good catalysts such as platinum and iridium oxides, the uncertainty is large enough to misclassify a broad fraction of the datasets as ``good'', which limits its value as a screening criterion. These results question the reliance on overpotential estimation as a primary evaluation metric to sort through catalyst candidates and calls for a shift in focus in the computational catalysis and machine learning communities towards other metrics such as synthesizability, stability, lifetime or affordability.</description>

      <title>polyRETRO: a Language Model Approach to predict Polymerization Class and Monomer(s) for a Target Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has transformed polymer design by enabling rapid property prediction and candidate generation, translating these designs into experimentally realizable materials remains a critical challenge. Traditionally, the synthesis of target polymers has relied heavily on expert intuition and prior experience. The lack of automated retrosynthetic tools to assist chemists, limit the rapid practical impact of data-driven polymer discovery. To expedite lab-scale validation and beyond, we present a retrosynthetic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide polymer synthesis. Our approach, which we call polyRETRO, involves two key steps: 1) predicting the most likely polymerization reaction class of a target polymer and 2) identifying the underlying chemical transformation templates and the corresponding monomers, using primarily natural-language based constructs. This LLM-driven framework enables direct retrosynthetic analysis given just the target polymer SMILES string. polyRETRO constitutes a initial step towards a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable approach to bridge the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the soft behavior of nematic elastomers over a range of temperature and strain rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematic elastomers are a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that exhibit both liquid-crystalline order and rubber (entropic) elasticity. This combination makes them stimuli-responsive soft materials with a number of unusual thermo-mechanical properties. They have been proposed for various applications, including soft robotics, enhanced adhesion, and impact resistance. This paper presents a new experimental setup and a comprehensive dataset characterizing the soft behavior of nematic elastomers over a range of temperatures and strain rates. We also fit the results to a recently developed model of nematic elastomers.</description>

      <title>An Orbifold Framework for Classifying Layer Groups with an Application to Knitted Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled structures such as textiles, polymer networks, and architected metamaterials are often doubly periodic. Due to this property and their finite transverse thickness, the symmetries of these materials are described by the crystallographic layer groups. While orbifold notation provides a compact topological description and classification of the planar wallpaper groups, no analogous framework has been available for the spatial layer groups. In this article we develop an orbifold theory in three dimensions and introduce a complete set of Conway-type symbols for all layer groups. To illustrate its applicability, we analyze several knitted fabric motifs and show how their layer-group symmetries are naturally expressed in this new orbifold notation. This work establishes a foundation for the topological classification of doubly periodic structures beyond the planar setting and supports structure-function analysis in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity enhancement and doping-dependent phase diagram of Sm-based oxypnictides by high-pressure growth technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.</description>

      <title>Spectrally-selective dynamic radiative thermoregulation via phase engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining comfortable temperatures for buildings, humans, and devices consumes a substantial portion of global energy, underscoring the urgent need for energy-efficient thermoregulation technologies. Dynamic radiative thermal emitters that can switch between passive cooling and heating modes offer a promising solution, but most existing devices exhibit broadband optical responses, resulting in unwanted parasitic heat exchange and limited performance. Here, we introduce an elegant strategy that uses a dielectric cap to transform broadband metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials into spectrally selective dynamic emitters. This design creates a highly tunable Fabry-Perot cavity, enabling a tailored thermal emission spectrum by engineering the reflected-wave phase profile. Our Fresnel-formalism-based phasor diagram analysis reveals two key routes for realizing high spectral selectivity: a high-index dielectric cap and a low-loss metallic MIT state, which are further validated by Bayesian optimization. Following this principle, we demonstrated a wide-angle spectrally-selective thermoregulator operating in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 um), where the thermal emittance can be electrically tuned from about 0.2 to 0.9 through reversible copper electrodeposition on a germanium cavity. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to multispectral electrochromic windows, enabling switching between solar heating and spectrally-selective radiative cooling. Our work establishes a versatile and generalizable paradigm for spectral engineering of dynamic thermal emitters, opening opportunities in energy-efficient buildings, wearable thermal comfort, spacecraft thermoregulation, and multispectral camouflage.</description>

      <title>Sub Band Gap Operation Limits for Perovskite Light Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra low voltage operation of Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has been demonstrated in recent years as high radiance with minimal power consumption is a desired feature. However, the light output at such conditions from PeLEDs is typically very low, and the maximum in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) are achieved at large biases with significant power consumption. Here, we explore the possibility of achieving maximums in EQE and ECE at sub band gap voltages for PeLEDs. Our analysis consistently interprets otherwise scattered experimental data from literature, identifies the limits for low voltage operation, and elucidates optimization routes for sub band gap high radiance operation of PeLEDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric. We apply these results to the $X$-wave magnets, which include $d$-wave, $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets as well as $p$-wave and $f$-wave magnets. They have universal physics for anomalous Hall conductivity, tunneling magneto-resistance and planar Hall effect. We obtain various analytic formulas based on the two-band Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Sub 1 K Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigeration with Rare-Earth Borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$, X = (Yb, Gd)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) is regaining relevance for the refrigeration to temperatures below 1 K as global helium-3 supply is increasingly strained. While ADR at these temperatures is long established with paramagnetic hydrated salts, more recently frustrated rare-earth oxides were found to offer higher entropy densities and practical advantages since they do not degrade under heating or evacuation. We report structural, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ with X = (Yb, Gd). Except for Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$, which orders at 108 mK, the three other materials remain paramagnetic down to their lowest measured temperatures. ADR performance starting at 2 K in a field of 5 T is analyzed and compared to literature results.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Orbital Degeneracy and Vacancies in Stabilizing Collinear Magnetic Order in Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, displays a contested magnetic structure, poised between collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. In this work, we investigate the magnetic structure of Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ at the microscopic level by combining single-crystal neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies. Our findings uncover a vacancy-driven route to control spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering in layered ferromagnets, offering new insights into the design of tunable 2D magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Toward a Theoretical Roadmap for Organic Memristive Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aspires to overcome the intrinsic inefficiencies of von Neumann architectures by co-locating memory and computation in physical devices that emulate biological neurons and synapses. Memristive materials stand at the core of this paradigm, enabling non-volatile, history-dependent electronic responses. While inorganic oxides currently dominate the field, molecular and polymeric systems can offer untapped advantages in terms of chemical tunability, structural flexibility, low-cost processing, and biocompatibility. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a theoretical framework able to rationalize how molecular structure translates into memristive function. Here, a multiscale computational perspective is presented, outlining how quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics, among other approaches, can be integrated into a coherent methodology to design next-generation organic memristors. Three mechanisms, ionic migration, redox-driven switching, and conduction interplay in chiral molecules are examined as representative routes toward molecular neuromorphic hardware. The opportunities and challenges associated with each mechanism are discussed, together with a view on how a theoretically guided roadmap can accelerate the emergence of chemically engineered synaptic materials.</description>

      <title>Comparing the latent features of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been proposed, among many other applications, as a efficient tool for the separation of atomic and molecular species and their corresponding isotopes, given the confinement provided by their subnanometric dimensions. In this work we present three dimensional quantum wave packet calculations revealing an enhancement in the quantum transport in bilayer over monolayer graphdiyne membranes, one of the most popular 2D materials which is commonly employed for this purpose. Besides, resonances emerge superimposed over the typical monolayer profile for transmission probabilities, a feature that is general to other bilayer nanoporous 2D heterostructures and that shows a strong dependence on the interlayer separation.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Resolving Abrikosov vortex entry in superconducting nano-string resonators via displacement-noise spectroscopy in cavity-optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors critically influence current flow and coherence, thereby imposing fundamental limits on superconducting quantum technologies. Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits. Beyond advancing vortex physics, this work opens new opportunities for integrating mechanical sensing into superconducting device architectures, bridging condensed matter physics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Uncovering surface states of the Dirac semimetal BaMg2Bi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaMg2Bi2 is a Dirac semimetal characterized by a simple Dirac cone crossing the Fermi level at the center of the Brillouin zone, protected by C3 rotational symmetry. Together with its Sr-based analogue SrMg2Bi2, it has been proposed as a promising candidate for a chemically driven topological switch: while SrMg2Bi2 is an insulator, BaMg2Bi2 exhibits non-trivial topological features. A detailed understanding of its electronic structure is essential to elucidate its electronic and transport properties. Previous photoemission studies confirmed the Dirac nature of BaMg2Bi2, but were limited to high photon energies, which hindered direct comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT), due to reduced resolution and higher-frequency matrix-element modulation in that regime. In this work, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT calculations to get full insight on the valence band states, providing a comprehensive picture of the low-energy electronic structure. Our measurements reveal the presence of previously unobserved surface states. We found that they are topologically trivial, but they unlock a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior, reconciling previous discrepancies between experiment and theory.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response of noncollinear spin systems at constrained magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncollinear magnets are notoriously difficult to describe within first-principles approaches based on density-functional theory (DFT) because of the presence of low-lying spin excitations. At the level of ground-state calculations, several methods exist to constrain the magnetic moments to a predetermined configuration, and thereby accelerate convergence towards self-consistency. Their use in a perturbative context, however, remains very limited. Here we present a general methodological framework to achieve parametric control over the local spin moments at the linear-response level. Our strategy builds on the concept of Legendre transform to switch between various flavors of magnetic functionals, and to relate their second derivatives via simple linear-algebra operations. Thereby, we can address an arbitrary response function at the time-dependent DFT level of theory with optimal accuracy and minimal computational effort. In the low frequency limit, we identify the leading correction to the existing adiabatic formulation of the problem [S. Ren \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. X {\bf 14}, 011041 (2024)], consisting in a renormalization of the phonon and magnon masses due to electron inertia. As a demonstration, we apply our methodology to the THz optical response of bulk CrI$_3$ and Cr$_2$O$_3$, where we identify contributions from hybrid (electro)magnons with mixed spin-lattice character.</description>

      <title>Large anisotropic magnetoresistance in $\alpha$-MnTe induced by strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha\textrm{-MnTe}$ is a p-type semiconducting altermagnet with a N\'eel temperature near $300\thinspace\textrm{K}$. Due to the altermagnetic nature, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken, and Kramers degeneracy is lifted in the valence band maxima along the $\Gamma\textrm{-K}$ line and the A point. However, the energy difference is found to be small, and any small shift in the spectrum can dramatically change the linear-response transport properties. Here we show that a strain modulating the [0001] axis of the unit cell by $\sim\pm0.5\%$ can significantly change the transport signature by switching the thermal window between the two regions of the valence band. When the $\Gamma\textrm{-K}$ line is dominating, the planar Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance can be enhanced by an order of magnitude, with the maximum up to $\sim70\%$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Momentum-Resolved Electron Energy-Loss Spectra of Coupled Phonon and Magnon Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectra in the scanning transmission microscope (STEM-EELS) that captures the effects of coupled phonon and magnon excitations within a unified formalism, and apply it to body-centered cubic iron at 300 K. By advancing the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunctions (TACAW) method to incorporate atomistic spin-lattice dynamics (ASLD), we simulate the EELS signal, including phonon-magnon interaction effects, dynamical diffraction, and multiple scattering. Our results reveal non-additive spectral features arising from phonon-magnon coupling, hybridization, and energy shifts, and further allow estimation of the electron dose required to detect magnon scattering under optimized detector conditions.</description>

      <title>SMC-X: A Distributed Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation Method for Chemically Complex Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To predict the complex chemical evolution in multicomponent alloys, it is highly desirable to have accurate atomistic simulation methods capable of reaching sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales. In this work, we advance the recently proposed SMC-X method through distributed computation on either GPUs or CPUs, pushing both spatial and temporal scales of atomistic simulation of chemically complex alloys to previously inaccessible scales. This includes a record-breaking 128-billion-atom HEA system extending to the micrometer regime in space, and a 1-billion-atom HEA evolved over more than three million Monte Carlo swap steps, approaching the minute regime in time. We show that such large-scale simulations are essential for bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical predictions of the nanoprecipitate sizes in HEAs, based on analysis using the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for diffusion-controlled coarsening. This work demonstrates the great potential of SMC-X for simulation-driven exploration of the chemical complexity in high-entropy materials at large spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven and Atomistically Validated Approach for Designing High-Strength and Ductility Aluminum Alloys for Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) processes, particularly laser powder bed fusion, offer exceptional design flexibility but impose extreme thermal conditions that limit the processability of high strength aluminum alloys. This work develops an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) framework that combines physics informed machine learning (ML) with large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to enable inverse design of Al alloys with improved strength ductility synergy tailored for AM. A heterogeneous multi process database of about 1500 alloys, spanning laser based and solid state AM, cast, and wrought routes, was assembled with yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation as target properties. Composition derived and rule of mixtures descriptors created from elemental properties define a 46 dimensional, physically interpretable feature space. A Random Forest regressor provides strong performance for strength (R2 about 0.85) and competitive accuracy for ductility, while SHAP analysis highlights stacking fault energy, solute misfit, and thermophysical descriptors as dominant factors. Robustness tests using fractional unknown row validation and evaluation on recently reported 2024 2025 AM alloys confirm that the model generalizes across composition process space. A strength ductility quality index is then used to map design spaces in benchmark alloy families, including binary Al Cu, quaternary Al Zn Mg Cu, and the Al92(Ti,Fe,Co,Ni)2 family, consistently identifying narrow composition windows with high synergy. Large scale MD simulations of Al(Fe,Co,Ni,Ti) alloys with varying Al content reproduce an inverted U shaped dependence of strength and ductility with a maximum near Al88 to Al92, in close agreement with ML predictions. The results demonstrate a data driven, physics aware workflow for accelerating discovery of next generation aluminum alloys for AM.</description>

      <title>Non-local Chemistry Driven by Cation-Anion Size Disparity in Helium Inserted Compounds under High Pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opposing the theory that Helium (He) cannot be inserted into AB-type ionic compounds due to the Madelung energy increase, our crystal structure search and first-principles calculations found that He can form stable compounds with sodium halides (NaX, X=Cl, Br, I) under high-pressure. These reactions are driven by the non-local chemistry arising from the cation-anion size disparity, distinctly different from the He insertion reaction with A2B-type compounds. The large size differences between Na+ and X- enable structures that can effectively host He insertions through volume and inter-atomic distance disproportionation. Furthermore, the insertion of He atoms can significantly relieve the elevated Madelung energy that builds up in NaX under high pressure. This energy increase arises from structural transitions driven by cation-anion size disparity, which are necessary for reducing volume under pressure. The insertion of He allows the reduction of the total volume under high pressure without increasing the Madelung energy. Our predicted compounds and stability analysis reveal a new example of He reactivity governed not by local chemical bond formation, but by long-range electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>More is different: How chemical complexity influences stability in high entropy oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Memory Window of Memristive Stacks via Engineered Interfaces with High Ionic Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The great potential of memristive devices for real-world applications still relies on overcoming key technical challenges, including the need for a larger number of stable resistance states, faster switching speeds, lower SET/RESET voltages, improved endurance, and reduced variability. One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window.</description>

Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

Abstract: Graphene, with spin and valley degrees of freedom, fosters unexpected physical and chemical properties for the realization of next-generation quantum devices. However, the spin symmetry of graphene is rather robustly protected, hampering manipulation of the spin degrees of freedom for the application of spintronic devices such as electric gate tunable spin filters. We demonstrate that a hybrid heterostructure composed of graphene and LaCoO3 epitaxial thin film exhibits an electrically tunable spin exchange splitting. The large and adjustable spin exchange splitting of 155.9 - 306.5 meV was obtained by the characteristic shifts in both the spin symmetry broken quantum Hall states and the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations. Strong hybridization induced charge transfer across the hybrid heterointerface has been identified for the observed spin exchange splitting. The substantial and facile controllability of the spin exchange splitting provides an opportunity for spintronics applications with the electrically-tunable spin polarization in hybrid heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors, which lack a unified theoretical description. Here, we study a mean-field model, recently shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. The driven mean-field model, featuring a disordered Hamiltonian structure, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features an oscillatory yielding transition, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system, along with memory formation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

      <title>Analytical approach to the magneto-fluorescence of triplet excitons</title>

Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycrystalline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.</description>

      <title>GPU-Portable Real-Space Density Functional Theory Implementation on Unified-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.</description>
