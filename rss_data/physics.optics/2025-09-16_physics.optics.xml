      <title>Generalized Time-Reversal for Pulse Control in Diffusive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry allows waves to retrace their paths through complex media and refocus at their origin. However, incomplete capture and reversal of scattered waves often limits pulse recompression. We address this challenge for spatially extended sources by introducing a generalized time-reversal framework, which identifies the optimal source pattern as the one that maximizes the energy of the waves that are captured and reversed. In a two-dimensional diffusive waveguide, we reconstruct the time-reversed wavefront corresponding to this optimal source using spatiospectral shaping, leading to a 35-fold enhancement in peak transmitted power compared to an unmodulated pulse. Internal spatiotemporal measurements reveal a ``loading and firing" process, in which energy accumulates within the medium and then is released abruptly. Moreover, time-reversing this burst enables deep energy delivery into the scattering medium. Generalized time-reversal opens new possibilities for short-pulse control in strongly-scattering media, with applications ranging from optogenetics to random laser amplification.</description>

Abstract: {We report on an intensity-only and deep-learning based method for laser beam characterization that allows to predict the underlying optical field within milliseconds. A simple near-field / far-field camera setup enables online control of an adaptive optics to optimize beam quality.

      <title>Reconfigurable structural color generation in multicolor pixels using phase-change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multilayer structures based on phase-change materials for reconfigurable structural color generation. These structures can produce multiple distinct colors within a single pixel. Specifically, we design structures that generate either two or four maximally distinct structural colors. We employ a memetic optimization algorithm coupled with the impedance method to identify the optimal combination of materials and layer thicknesses that maximizes the distinctiveness of the generated colors. We demonstrate that our design approach achieves strong color contrast between the generated colors. The proposed multilayer design eliminates the need for subwavelength lithography, making it highly suitable for large-scale applications. Our results could lead to a new class of single-cell multicolor pixels which retain each color without power consumption, making them particularly appealing for low refresh rate displays.</description>

      <title>Localized Floquet modes in arrays of out-of-phase curved waveguides with a quasiperiodic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light propagation in an array of periodically curved waveguides consisting of pairs of waveguides with out-of-phase oscillations of waveguide centers. We compute the corresponding Floquet propagation constants and find pseudocollapses where the Floquet bands shrink and, respectively, light diffraction is significantly inhibited. When, in addition, the refractive index of the waveguides in the array have quasiperiodic modulation in the transverse direction, we establish the existence of Floquet modes localized in the transverse direction and periodic in the longitudinal direction. With increase of the depth of quasiperiodic modulation of the refractive index in the array, the localized Floquet modes emerge near the pseudocollapse points of the periodic array. In array with sufficiently high frequencies of waveguide oscillations, the localized Floquet modes can exist even for weak quasiperiodic modulation which is situated below the localization transition in the array of straight waveguides.</description>

      <title>State Tomography of Toroidal Light Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toroidal pulses, also known as Focused or Flying Doughnuts (FDs), are few-cycle pulses of doughnut-like topology. Originally proposed by Hellwarth and Nouchi in 1996, they have recently been experimentally realized. Toroidal pulses exhibit intriguing topological features, including skyrmionic field configurations and extensive regions of energy backflow, while their light-matter interactions have been associated with the excitation of toroidal and non-radiating modes in matter. The non-separable nature of toroidal pulses, encompassing both space-time and space-polarization couplings, positions them as promising candidates for robust information and energy transport. However, advancing their fundamental study and deployment in applications requires practical characterization methods, particularly with respect to their non-separability. In this work, we experimentally generate collimated optical toroidal pulses and analyze their space-polarization and space-time couplings using tomographic techniques. We quantify their degree of non-separability through measures such as concurrence and fidelity, benchmarking against ideal FD pulses. The reported results will be of interest to the fundamental study of toroidal pulses and spatiotemporal structured light more broadly, enabling applications in telecommunications, spectroscopy, metrology, and imaging.</description>

      <title>Absorber of Topologically Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization- and wavelength-sensitive absorbers for homogeneous electromagnetic waves are crucial in photovoltaics, imaging and telecommunications. Here, we report on an absorber selective to the topological structure of light. An electromagnetic beam or pulse containing polarization singularities can be fully dissipated by the absorber, while plane waves are rejected regardless of their polarization. The absorber comprises a conical mirror coaxial with the incident propagating beam, which the mirror converts into a standing wave defined by the geometrical Pancharatnam-Berry phase accumulated upon reflection on the mirror. If a "nanowire" absorber is placed along the axis of the cone, singularly-polarized light can create an antinode of the standing wave at the absorber and nearly perfect dissipation of the light's energy is achievable regardless of the wavelength. The selective absorber of topologically structured light is of interest for energy harvesting, detection, filtering, and telecommunications applications.</description>

      <title>SU(2) gadget for higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of two quarter-wave plates and one half-wave plate, regardless of their sequential arrangement, constitutes a well-established universal SU(2) gadget capable of implementing all polarization transformations on the standard Poincar\'{e} sphere. However, there is no analogous system for realizing all polarization transformations on the higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere, a member of a higher topological index space. This work demonstrates that an optical gadget, comprising two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, arranged in any order, is an SU(2) gadget to realize arbitrary polarization evolution on the higher-order Poincar\'{e} sphere.</description>

      <title>Imaging through volumetric scattering media by decoding angular light paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution optical microscopy has transformed biological imaging, yet its resolution and contrast deteriorate with depth due to multiple light scattering. Conventional correction strategies typically approximate the medium as one or a few discrete layers. While effective in the presence of dominant scattering layers, these approaches break down in thick, volumetric tissues, where accurate modeling would require an impractically large number of layers. To address this challenge, we introduce an inverse-scattering framework that represents the entire volume as a superposition of angular deflectors, each corresponding to scattering at a specific angle. This angular formulation is particularly well suited to biological tissues, where narrow angular spread due to the dominant forward scattering allow most multiple scattering to be captured with relatively few components. Within this framework, we solve the inverse problem by progressively incorporating contributions from small to large deflection angles. Applied to simulations and in vivo reflection-mode imaging through intact mouse skull, our method reconstructs up to 121 angular components, converting ~80% of multiply scattered light into signal. This enables non-invasive visualization of osteocytes in the skull that remain inaccessible to existing layer-based methods. These results establish the scattering-angle basis as a deterministic framework for imaging through complex media, paving the way for high-resolution microscopy deep inside living tissues.</description>

      <title>Integration of $\text{Er}^{3+}$-emitters in silicon-on-insulator nanodisks metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium ($\text{Er}^{3+}$) emitters are relevant for optical applications due to their narrow emission line directly in the telecom C-band due to the ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{13/2}}$ $\rightarrow$ ${}^\text{4}\text{I}_{\text{15/2}}$ transition at 1.54 $\mu$m. Additionally they are promising candidates for future quantum technologies when embedded in thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) to achieve fabrication scalability and CMOS compatibility. In this paper we integrate $\text{Er}^{3+}$ emitters in SOI metasurfaces made of closely spaced array of nanodisks, to study their spontaneous emission via room and cryogenic temperature confocal microscopy, off-resonance and in-resonance photoluminescence excitation at room temperature and time resolved spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the possibility to adopt CMOS-compatible and fabrication scalable metasurfaces for controlling and improving the collection efficiency of the spontaneous emission from the $\text{Er}^{3+}$ transition in SOI and could be adopted in similar technologically advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Infrared Spectroradiometry of Lithium Benzoate from 21 to 235 THz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an extensive survey of the thermal radiation properties of lithium benzoate. We heated the sample from 313 to 553 K, just below the melting point, while performing an infrared spectroradiometry with an FT-IR spectrometer from 21 to 235 THz (700-7800 cm$^{-1}$). We have provided a detailed analysis of the infrared spectrum data and a comparison of the absorption spectrum of the same sample. It turned out that the recorded spectra are not only different from ordinary absorption spectra but also carry substantial information about the temperature dependence of the population of vibrationally excited states. We conclude by proposing a hypothesis on the thermal excitation mechanism of vibrational energy levels of molecules consistent with the distinct characteristics of the obtained infrared emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Heralded Emission Detection in Quantum Dot Solids under Twin-Photon Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging direction in optical spectroscopy, but experimental progress has thus far been limited to fluorescence-detected studies of molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Circuits with Nonlinear Dynamics and Memory for Time Sequence Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neuromorphic computing offers compelling advantages in power efficiency and parallel processing, but often falls short in realizing scalable nonlinearity and long-term memory. We overcome these limitations by employing silicon microring resonator (MRR) networks. These integrated photonic circuits enable compact, high-throughput neuromorphic computing by simultaneously exploiting spatial, temporal, and wavelength dimensions. This work advances the investigation of MRR networks for photonics-based machine learning (ML). We demonstrate the system's effectiveness on two widely used image classification benchmarks, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, by encoding images directly into time sequences. In particular, we enhance the computational performance of a linear readout classifier within the reservoir computing paradigm through the strategic use of multiple physical output ports, diverse laser wavelengths, and varied input power levels. Moreover, we achieve substantially improved accuracies in a single-pixel classification setting without relying on digital memory, thanks to the inherent memory and parallelism of our MRR network.</description>

      <title>Bridging mid and near infrared by combining optomechanics and self mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes a self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform for transferring information between near- and mid-infrared radiation. In particular, the self-mixing signal of a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser is used to detect the oscillation of a membrane induced by radiation pressure exerted by a near-infrared excitation beam, which is amplitude-modulated at the membrane resonance frequency. This technique is, in principle, wavelength-independent and, therefore, can link different spectral regions from both the excitation and probe sides. This versatility can pave the way for future applications of this self-mixing-assisted optomechanical platform in communication and advanced sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of moir\'e excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\'e potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moir\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moir\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moir\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in ReS2 via ferroelectric gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically tunable linear dichroism (LD) with non-volatile properties represents a critical yet elusive feature for next-generation integrated photonic elements in practical device architectures. Here, we demonstrate record-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional ReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our ferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability of differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any electrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical states exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied bias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental characterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric polarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2, selectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural distortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the "up" polarization state while leaving the "down" state unperturbed. This ferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for voltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic polarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well as programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Probing laser-driven surface and subsurface dynamics via grazing-incidence XFEL scattering and diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a grazing-incidence x-ray platform that simultaneously records time-resolved grazing-incidence small-angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) and grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GID) from a femtosecond laser-irradiated gold film above the melting threshold, with picosecond resolution at an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL). By tuning the x-ray incidence angle, the probe depth is set to tens of nanometers, enabling depth-selective sensitivity to near-surface dynamics. GISAXS resolves ultrafast changes in surface nanomorphology (correlation length, roughness), while GID quantifies subsurface lattice compression, grain orientation, melting, and recrystallization. The approach overcomes photon-flux limitations of synchrotron grazing-incidence geometries and provides stringent, time-resolved benchmarks for complex theoretical models of ultrafast laser-matter interaction and warm dense matter. Looking ahead, the same depth-selective methodology is well suited to inertial confinement fusion (ICF): it can visualize buried-interface perturbations and interfacial thermal resistance on micron to sub-micron scales that affect instability seeding and burn propagation.</description>

      <title>Programmable Optical Filters Based on Feed-Forward Photonic Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12059v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate an integrated photonic circuit based on feed forward photonic meshes that can be programmed and reconfigured to perform arbitrary spectral filter functions. We investigate a subset of the available filter functions, demonstrating that a N = 4 input triangular mesh with M = 3 layers may be operated via self-configuration algorithms to filter M arbitrary wavelengths from a given input spectrum. The tunable nature of the architecture enables preconfigured filter functions to be swept in the spectral domain continuously over the free spectral range of the device. This removes any strict requirements between the design parameters of the architecture and the center wavelength of a desired filter function. With this architecture, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary wavelength rejection filters with contrasts as deep as 40 dB. Further, by intentionally selecting the center wavelengths of each filter function to lie along a wavelength grid we demonstrate deep wavelength division demultiplexing (DWDM) with inter-channel crosstalk between -25 dB and -40 dB. Unlike typical DWDM systems, in this architecture the center wavelength of each channel is not fixed at fabrication and instead may be swept or reordered arbitrarily. This device demonstrates advantages over typical methods for DWDM, Raman spectroscopy, and correlation spectroscopy as well as other applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally generate optical tornado waves using spatial multiplexing on a single-phase modulation device. In their focal region, the intensity pattern outlines a spiral of decreasing radius and pitch. We examine the propagation dynamics of such novel waves and reveal the key factors that lead to angular acceleration. Moreover, we propose a two-color scheme that makes it possible to generate dynamically twisting light, an optical analog of a drill, that can rotate at THz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical Driven-Dissipative Dynamics in Collective Quantum Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced abstract. This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in collective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum emitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures, focusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay among quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a rich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been widely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters modelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting superradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly connecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to the Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical studies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity, photon statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology. The sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving strength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging. Unexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population through dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we develop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We also analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying five mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced here. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables scalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as quantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous broadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing cooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Total Variation Subgradient Guided Image Fusion for Dual-Camera CASSI System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral imaging technology has long-faced fundamental challenges in balancing spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. While compressive sensing-based Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) mitigates this trade-off through optical encoding, high compression ratios result in ill-posed reconstruction problems. Traditional model-based methods exhibit limited performance due to reliance on handcrafted inherent image priors, while deep learning approaches are constrained by their black-box nature, which compromises physical interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-camera CASSI reconstruction framework that integrates total variation (TV) subgradient theory. By establishing an end-to-end SD-CASSI mathematical model, we reduce the computational complexity of solving the inverse problem and provide a mathematically well-founded framework for analyzing multi-camera systems. A dynamic regularization strategy is introduced, incorporating normalized gradient constraints from RGB/panchromatic-derived reference images, which constructs a TV subgradient similarity function with strict convex optimization guarantees. Leveraging spatial priors from auxiliary cameras, an adaptive reference generation and updating mechanism is designed to provide subgradient guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves spatial-spectral structural consistency. The theoretical framework establishes an interpretable mathematical foundation for computational spectral imaging, demonstrating robust performance across diverse reconstruction scenarios.

      <title>Practical Routing and Criticality in Large-Scale Quantum Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of a communication network hinges upon both its physical architecture and the protocols that are employed within it. In the context of quantum communications, there exists a fundamental rate-loss tradeoff for point-to-point quantum channels such that the rate for distributing entanglement, secret keys, or quantum states decays exponentially with respect to transmission distance. Quantum networks are the solution to overcome point-to-point limitations, but they simultaneously invite a challenging open question: How should quantum networks be designed to effectively and efficiently guarantee high rates? Now that performance and physical topology are inexorably linked, this question is not easy, but the answer is essential for a future quantum internet to be successful. In this work, we offer crucial insight into this open question for complex optical-fiber quantum networks. Using realistic descriptions of quantum networks via random network models and practical end-to-end routing protocols, we reveal critical phenomena associated with large-scale quantum networks. Our work reveals the weaknesses of applying single-path routing protocols within quantum networks, observing an inability to achieve reliable rates over long distances. Adapting novel algorithms for multi-path routing, we employ an efficient and practical multi-path routing algorithm capable of boosting performance while minimizing costly quantum resources.</description>

Abstract: A semi-empirical model is presented for the thermalized temperature $T$ and mean momentum in the direction of laser propagation &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt; of electrons released from O$_{2}$ after the passage of a focused $800$ nm ultrashort pulsed laser pulse vs. peak laser intensity $I_{0}$ to provide initial conditions for electrodynamic fluid simulations. For this, theoretical kinetic energy spectra in different directions are modified with two adjustable parameters representing the effects of electron rescatter off its parent ion during the optical cycle subsequent to ionization. The classical kinematics of rescatter, in conjunction with the spectral fits, is used to estimate &lt;$p_{fz}$&gt;.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Fluids for Nonlinear Photonics: Evaluation of Temperature Dependence of Second-Order Susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic fluids are promising materials for tunable nonlinear photonics, with applications ranging from second harmonic generation to sources of entangled photons. However, the few reported values of second-order susceptibilities vary widely depending on the molecular architecture. Here, we systematically measure second-order NLO susceptibilities of five different materials that exhibit the ferroelectric nematic phase, as well as the more recently discovered layered smectic A ferroelectric phase. The materials investigated include archetypal molecular architectures as well as mixtures showing room-temperature ferroelectric phases. The measured values, which range from 0.3 to 20 pm/V, are here reasonably predicted by combining calculations of molecular-level hyperpolarizabilities and a simple nematic potential, highlighting the opportunities of modelling-assisted design for enhanced NLO ferroelectric fluids.</description>

      <title>An Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments. We outline a path toward novel dark matter constraints in future experiments by exploiting arrays of mass-loaded optomechanical sensors at lower temperature probed with distributed squeezed light.</description>

Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an all-optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables fully optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free nonlinear activation. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Reverse energy flows: the physical mechanism underling dramatic reduction of loss in hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hollow-core fibers (HCFs) with claddings composed of silica glass capillaries have recently attracted a great deal of attention following the demonstration of optical loss levels lower than those of conventional telecommunication fibers. It is well established already that optical losses in HCFs are highly sensitive to both the wavelength and the geometry of the cladding capillaries. The underlying physical mechanisms behind reducing loss with the change of HCF design parameters while keeping the same fiber structure are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the relationship between light localization and corresponding decrease of losses in HCFs and the distribution of reverse energy fluxes in air-core modes. We show here that the shape of the capillaries plays a crucial role in controlling radial energy backflows that influence light confinement and the energy leakage from air-core modes of HCFs. Through numerical modeling, we demonstrate that optimizing the capillary geometry to tailor the distribution of reverse radial energy fluxes leads to a substantial reduction in transmission losses even in fibers with relatively simple cladding structures. Consideration of the energy flows and observed occurrences of vortex of the Poynting vector allows us to a draw an interesting interdisciplinary analogy with the hydrodynamical system with suppressed backward flow - Tesla valve. We believe that combination of singular optics and energy fluxes analysis provides valuable physical insight into the mechanisms governing waveguiding in HCFs offering a pathway toward novel designs with minimized leakage loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic circuits are central to classical and quantum information processing. While integrated technologies dominate, free-space architectures are emerging as attractive alternatives, offering broad bandwidth and direct manipulation of optical modes without confinement in waveguides. A key challenge for scalability lies in circuit depth, as the number of layers manipulating the optical field typically grows with the system size. Here, we introduce a programmable free-space photonic platform that performs high-dimensional unitary transformations using only three layers. Information is encoded in structured light modes defined by circular polarization and quantized transverse momenta, and processed with spatial light modulators interleaved with half-wave plates. We implement unitaries that are equivalent to quantum walks over up to 30 time steps, in one- and two-dimensional lattices, distributing a single input mode across more than 7,000 outputs, where conventional approaches would require tens or hundreds of layers. Despite being restricted to translationally-invariant systems, the platform supports diverse quantum walk dynamics, including disorder, synthetic gauge fields, and topological effects, previously explored only in separate experiments. Using coincidence detection with a time-tagging camera, we show compatibility with quantum optics protocols and provide examples of quantum walks of heralded single photons. These results contribute to establish free-space optical processors as promising resources for high-dimensional quantum simulation and scalable optical information processing.</description>

Abstract: The recently observed plasmonic skyrmions, as electromagnetic counterparts of topologically stable quasiparticles, hold significant promise as novel carriers for robust information transfer and manipulation of nontrivial light-matter interactions. However, their practical applications has been hindered by the lack of flexible tuning devices to encode these topological structures. Here, we present a programmable plasmonic skyrmion platform capable of encoding diverse skyrmion topologies, including Neel-type skyrmions and merons. Based on unprecedented ultra-fast coding feature, we synthesize harmonic skyrmions in the temporal dimension and, for the first time, applied skyrmions in communication and sensing applications. Specifically, we achieved highly robust and multi-channel wireless communications by using programmable topological skyrmions, providing a promising platform for communication in turbulent noise channels and extreme conditions. Furthermore, we implemented intelligent sensing across twenty animal models on the same platform, achieving high recognition accuracy. This methodology offers programmable and temporal insights into the skyrmions for their practical applications in next-generation wireless communication and intelligent sensing.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that the resolution of superlensing slabs can be significantly enhanced with complex frequency illuminations. In this study, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for analyzing superlensing. The framework offers new and transparent insights. It helps clarify what resolution can be expected with complex frequency, or more generally pulse illuminations, but it also highlights inherent limitations and tempers high expectations raised by the recent electromagnetic experiments.</description>

      <title>Low-Frequency Scattering of TE and TM Waves by an Inhomogeneous Medium with Planar Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stationary scattering of TE and TM waves propagating in an isotropic medium with planar symmetry is described by Bergmann's equation in one dimension. This is a generalization of Helmholtz equation which allows for developing transfer matrix methods to deal with the corresponding scattering problems. We use a dynamical formulation of stationary scattering to study the low-frequency scattering of these waves when the inhomogeneities of the medium causing the scattering are confined to a planar slab. This formulation relies on the construction of an effective two-level non-Hermitian quantum system whose time-evolution operator determines the transfer matrix. We use it to construct the low-frequency expansions of the transfer matrix and the reflection and transmission coefficients of the medium, introduce a generalization of Brewster's angle for inhomogeneous slabs at low frequencies, and derive analytic conditions for transparency and reflectionlessness of PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric slabs at these frequencies. We also discuss the application of this method to deal with the low-frequency scattering of TE and TM waves when the carrier medium occupies a half-space and the waves satisfy boundary conditions with planar symmetry at the boundary of the half-space. Because acoustic waves propagating in a compressible fluid with planar symmetry are also described by Bergmann's equation, our results apply to the low-frequency scattering of these waves.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators.</description>

      <title>Versatile luminescence macroscope with dynamic illumination for photoactive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luminescence imaging is invaluable for studying biological and material systems, particularly when advanced protocols that exploit temporal dynamics are employed. However, implementing such protocols often requires custom instrumentation, either modified commercial systems or fully bespoke setups, which poses a barrier for researchers without expertise in optics, electronics, or software. To address this, we present a versatile macroscopic fluorescence imaging system capable of supporting a wide range of protocols, and provide detailed build instructions along with open-source software to enable replication with minimal prior experience. We demonstrate its broad utility through applications to plants, reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-shot HDR using conventional image sensor shutter functions and optical randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene. The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with 48dB dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Exploring the feasibility of probabilistic and deterministic quantum gates between T centers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.</description>

      <title>Stability of Adiabatic States in a Dissipative Three-Level System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of adiabatic states in three-level quantum systems are investigated analytically and numerically. Various possible configurations of three-level systems under exact two-photon resonance are considered. It is shown that in all these schemes, the lifetime of the studied states is determined by the dephasing time between levels that are not connected by a dipole transition. An efficient population transfer through the b-state at room temperature is demonstrated despite relatively long relaxation times. It is also demonstrated that, in case of large one-photon detuning, the so-called b-state has the same lifetime as that of the dark state. The evolution of adiabatic states for arbitrary values of single-photon detunings has been studied numerically.</description>
