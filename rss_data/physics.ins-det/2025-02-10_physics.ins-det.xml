      <title>Removal of radon progeny from delicate surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\rm ^{210}Po$ $\alpha$-decay driven neutron background is a concern for many low-energy rare event experiments. It is a difficult-to-control background that depends on the air exposure history of parts. In this study we demonstrate that about half of the radon progeny $\rm ^{210}Po$ can be removed from copper and silicon surfaces by wiping it with an acetone wetted tissue. For a copper sample we demonstrate that $\rm ^{210}Pb$ is removed with similar effectiveness. Additional wiping was found to be largely ineffective.</description>

      <title>High-End Space Electronics: Active Shielding to Mitigate Catastrophic Single-Event Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating electronic systems in space environments presents significant challenges due to continuous exposure to cosmic, solar, and trapped radiation, which can induce catastrophic single-event effects. This paper introduces a novel nonintrusive mitigation apparatus designed to protect high-end commercial off-the-shelf electronics in space. The apparatus incorporates an array of real-time particle detectors coupled with a mitigation algorithm. Upon identifying potentially harmful particles, the system power cycles affected electronics, preempting permanent damage. The apparatus was evaluated using GEANT4 simulations, which were compared with empirical data from the "COTS-Capsule" experiment aboard the International Space Station, demonstrating strong agreement. Key results indicate that the system achieves a 95% detection accuracy with a power cycle rate of once every seven hours per square centimeter of sensitive electronics. The COTS-Capsule represents a cost-effective, flexible solution for integrating modern, high-end, non-space-qualified electronics into a variety of space missions, addressing critical challenges in the new-space era.</description>

      <title>ALICE ITS2: overview and performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new Inner Tracking System (ITS2) is instrumental for tracking and vertex reconstruction in the ALICE experiment. The new tracker consists of seven cylindrical layers equipped with silicon Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) with a pixel size of 27 by 29 $\rm{\mu}$m. The sensors are thinned down to a thickness of 50 $\mu$m and 100 $\mu$m for the three innermost layers and for the four outer layers, respectively. The material budget of the innermost layers is as low as 0.36% $X_{0}$/ layer compared to 1.14% $X_{0}$/ layer of the previous ITS1. In combination with a radius of 23 mm for the innermost layer and a position resolution of about 5 $\mu$m, the low material budget greatly enhances the reconstruction capabilities of heavy-flavour and low-$p_{\rm T}$ particles compared to Run 2. ITS2 has been in operation since the beginning of Run 3 and has already recorded more than 42 pb$^{-1}$ proton-proton events at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and more than 2 nb$^{-1}$ Pb--Pb events at $ \sqrt{s_{ \rm{NN} }} $ = 5.36 TeV, operating stably during these operations at interaction rate up to 4 MHz in pp and about 50 kHz in Pb--Pb collisions. This contribution will review the detector performance during LHC Run 3 and give an overview on the calibration methods and running experience</description>

      <title>Integration Concept of the CBM Micro Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) is the most upstream detector of the fixed-target Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It enables high-precision low-momentum tracking in direct proximity of the target. Reaching the stringent requirements for the MVD, a material budget of~$0.3\,-\,0.5\%\,X_0$ per layer, operating the dedicated CMOS MAPS~(`MIMOSIS') in the target vacuum, the strong magnetic dipole field, and a harsh radiation environment~(5\,Mrad, $7\times10^{13}\,n_{\text{eq}}/\text{cm}^2$ per CBM year), poses an unprecedented integration challenge. In this paper, the integration concept of the detector is be outlined, elaborating on the selection and preparation of materials, assembly procedures, and quality assessment steps in the ongoing preparation of pre-series production and detector commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>Detection efficiency and spatial resolution of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors bent to different radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent monolithic active pixel sensors are the basis for the planned fully cylindrical ultra low material budget tracking detector ITS3 of the ALICE experiment. This paper presents results from testbeam campaigns using high-energy particles to verify the performance of 50 um thick bent ALPIDE chips in terms of efficiency and spatial resolution. The sensors were bent to radii of 18, 24 and 30 mm, slightly smaller than the foreseen bending radii of the future ALICE ITS3 layers. An efficiency larger than $99.9\%$ and a spatial resolution of approximately 5 um, in line with the nominal operation of flat ALPIDE sensors, is obtained at nominal operating conditions. These values are found to be independent of the bending radius and thus constitute an additional milestone in the demonstration of the feasibility of the planned ITS3 detector. In addition, a special geometry in which the beam particles graze the chip and traverse it laterally over distances of up to 3 mm is investigated.</description>

      <title>An Arbitrary Time Interval Generator Base on Vernier Clocks with 0.67 ps Adjustable Steps Implemented in FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In TDC testing or timing system implementation tasks, it is often desirable to generate signal pulses with fine adjustable time intervals. In delay cell-based schemes, the time adjustment steps are limited by the propagation delays of the cells, which are typically 15 to 20 picoseconds per step and are sensitive to temperature and operating voltage. In this document, a purely digital scheme based on two vernier clocks with small frequency difference generated using cascaded PLL is reported. The scheme is tested in two families of low-cost FPGA and 0.67 and 0.97 picoseconds adjustable steps of the time intervals are achieved.</description>

      <title>Calibration of a $\Delta$E-E telescope based on CeBr$_3$ scintillator for secondary charged particles measurements in hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadrontherapy is a promising cancer treatment method that offers better dose conformity and reduces damage to healthy tissues compared to conventional radiotherapy. However, one major challenge remaining is the precise characterization of secondary particles generated by nuclear interactions of the primary beam with tissues. Current data on secondary charged particles, such as protons and light ions, remain insufficient, particularly in the clinically relevant energy ranges. This lack of experimental data introduces uncertainties in treatment planning softwares and Monte Carlo calculations, thus compromising the accuracy of dose delivery to the patients. This work consists in the characterization of secondary charged particles generated in hadron therapy using a $\Delta$E-E telescope comprising a CeBr$_3$ crystal scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The calibration and response of this telescope to ions commonly used in clinical settings is presented in this work, highlighting adherence to Birks law for accurate energy measurements. This study is the first to optimize a $\Delta$E-E telescope combining CeBr$_3$ and plastic scintillators specifically for secondary particle detection in hadrontherapy. This represents an important step in the exploitation of the system for nuclear data acquisition, as it enables both the measurement of energy and the discrimination of secondary particles. The objective is to develop a system compatible with clinical use, allowing for the most precise possible comparison with treatment planning software calculations.</description>

      <title>Testing the limits of ITkPixV2: the ATLAS inner tracker pixel detector readout chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ITkPixV2 chip is the final production readout chip for the ATLAS Phase 2 Inner Tracker (ITk) upgrade at the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Due to the extraordinarily high peak luminosity at the HL-LHC of $5 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, ITkPixV2 must meet significant increases in nearly all design requirements, including a 10x increase in trigger rate, a 7.5x increase in hit rate, a 3x increase in radiation tolerance, and a 12.5x decrease in pixel current draw per unit area, all while maintaining a similar power per unit area as present pixel detectors. Here we present the first measurements of the ITkPixV2 chip operated at the limits of the full chip design requirements, including in particular a measurement of the activity-induced current of the chip as a function of increasing hit rate.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Absolute Photon Detection Efficiency of the DUNE Far Detector Vertical Drift X-ARAPUCAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline (1300 km) neutrino experiment hosted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). It aims to measure neutrino mass ordering and CP violation through neutrino oscillations from a characterized muon neutrino beam. DUNE will deploy four Liquid-Argon Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) detectors with a total mass of approximately 70 kT. The reconstruction of particle interactions, both from the beam and external neutrino sources is achieved by collecting two distinct interaction signals: ionization electrons with the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and scintillation photons (127 nm) with the Photon Detection System (PDS). Regarding the latter, to fulfil the physics requirements of the experiment, a uniform and efficient collection of the argon scintillation light across the 62 m x 15 m x 14 m detector volume is required to achieve an average detected light yield of at least 20 PE/MeV. For the case of DUNE's far detector module with vertical drift direction (FD-VD), the system relies on 672 X-ARAPUCA (XA) tiles, which trap photons inside its highly reflective box by shifting VUV light to visible wavelengths. An intensive R&amp;D campaign, involving multiple international institutions, has optimized the design and component selection for the next-generation PDS modules, which have been tested in liquid argon using a dedicated cryogenic setup developed at CIEMAT to evaluate their photon detection efficiency (PDE). Several configurations have been chosen to evaluate the possible design improvements in terms of different light-trapping strategies and reflectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A GAGG detector capable of dissecting a multi-coincidence solar neutrino interaction on ${}^{71}$Ga is under development for potential space-based applications. We identify three distinct detection signatures when ${}^{71}$Ge$^*$ is produced, two of which are significantly delayed in time and could be detected within a single large GAGG volume. Further optimizations can be made by optically isolating smaller segments of GAGG to maximize the probability of a spatial separation between the prompt/delayed signals. We construct and test prototype GAGG detectors capable of sub 4% energy resolution @ ${}^{137}$Cs and reliable detection of spatially-separated ${}^{57}$Co double-pulse decays.</description>

      <title>Impulse measurements enhanced with squeezed readout light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify how squeezed light can reduce quantum measurement noise to levels below the standard quantum limit in impulse measurements with mechanical detectors. The broadband nature of the signal implies that frequency-dependent squeezing performs better than frequency-independent squeezing. We calculate the optimal scaling of the impulse sensitivity with the squeezing strength, and quantify degradations due to photodetection losses. Even for lossless measurement, we find there exists a fundamental limit to the benefit of squeezing that depends only on the system's mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Performance studies of the CE-65v2 MAPS prototype structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the next upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system (ITS3) as its primary focus, a set of small MAPS test structures have been developed in the 65 nm TPSCo CMOS process. The CE-65 focuses on the characterisation of the analogue charge collection properties of this technology. The latest iteration, the CE-65v2, was produced in different processes (Standard, with a low-dose n-type blanket, and blanket with gap between pixels), pixel pitches (15, 18, 22.5 $\mu$m) and pixel arrangements (square or staggered). The comparatively large pixel array size of $48\times24$ pixels in CE-65v2 allows, among other benefits, to study the uniformity of the pixel response.
  The CE-65v2 chip was characterised in a test beam at the CERN SPS. A first analysis showed that hit efficiencies of $\geq 99\%$ and spatial resolution better than 5 $\mu$m can be achieved for all pitches and process variants. For the Standard process, thanks to larger charge sharing, even spatial resolutions below 3 $\mu$m are reached, in line with vertex detector requirements for the FCC-ee.
  This contribution further investigates the data collected at the SPS test beam. Thanks to the large sensor size and efficient data collection, a large amount of statistics was collected, which allows for detailed in-pixel studies to see the efficiency and spatial resolution as a function of the hit position within the pixels. Again, different pitches and process variants are compared.</description>

      <title>10$^{-15}$-level laser stabilization down to fiber thermal noise limit using self-homodyne detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a self-homodyne detection method to stabilize a continuous-wave 1550-nm laser to a 1-km optical fiber delay line, achieving a frequency instability of 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; at a 16-ms averaging time. This result, limited by fiber thermal noise, is achieved without the need for a vacuum system, highlighting the potential of our approach for ultra-stable laser systems in non-laboratory environments. The system utilizes only a few passive fiber optic components and a single balanced photodetector, significantly simplifying the laser stabilization process while maintaining high performance. The entire optical setup is compactly packaged in a portable metal air-tight case.</description>

Abstract: Thermal light dark matter (LDM) with particle masses in the 1 MeV - 1 GeV range could successfully explain the observed dark matter abundance as a relic from the primordial Universe. In this picture, a new feeble interaction acts as a "portal" between the Standard Model and LDM particles, allowing for the exploration of this paradigm at accelerator experiments. In the last years, the "missing energy" experiment NA64e at CERN SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) has set world-leading constraints in the vector-mediated LDM parameter space, by exploiting a 100 GeV electron beam impinging on an electromagnetic calorimeter, acting as an active target. In this paper, we report a detailed description of the analysis of a preliminary measurement with a 70 GeV positron beam at NA64e, performed during summer 2023 with an accumulated statistic of 1.6 x 10^10 positrons on target. This data set was analyzed with the primary aim of evaluating the performance of the NA64e detector with a lower energy positron beam, towards the realization of the post-LS3 program. The analysis results, other than additionally probing unexplored regions in the LDM parameter space, provide valuable information towards the future NA64e positron campaign.</description>

      <title>The vertexing challenge at FCC-ee</title>

Abstract: Following in the footsteps of the LHC, the Future Circular Collider (FCC) plans to be the next multi-generational collider project. In the first stage, FCC-ee will collide intense beams of electrons and positrons at centre of mass energies between 88 and 365 GeV, making it an electroweak, flavour, Higgs and top factory. The unprecedented statistical precision requires FCC-ee experiments to limit their systematic uncertainties to the very minimum.
  The precise reconstruction of the interaction vertices is central to most measurements at FCC-ee, such as rare flavour physics processes and the measurement of Higgs and Z decays to bottom and charm quarks and taus. This contribution will discuss the requirements of FCC-ee vertex detectors, from the necessary impact parameter resolution via the challenging collision environment at the Z pole to the tight requirement on the material budget, which should be kept below 0.3% of a radiation length per detection layer. Next, the proposed vertex detector designs for FCC-ee are shortly presented, and an outlook is given on novel detector designs and features.
  The requirements for the vertexing performance translate into requirements for the sensors used for the vertex detector. As discussed in this contribution, they need to feature a spatial resolution of about 3 $\mu$m and provide timing information of O($\mu$s-ns) while keeping power consumption minimal to allow for air-cooling of the detector - minimising the detector material budget.
  The only type of sensor capable of aiming to fulfil such requirements are CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), which combine signal generation, amplification and readout into a single silicon die. Therefore, the rest of this contribution will present an overview of existing and planned MAPS technologies and prototypes aiming to fulfil the stringent FCC-ee vertex detector requirements.</description>
