      <title>Forward-Oriented Causal Observables for Non-Stationary Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting in financial time series under strict causal constraints, treating the market as a non-stationary stochastic system in which any predictive observable must be computable online from information available up to the decision time. Rather than proposing a machine-learning predictor or a direct price-forecast model, we focus on \emph{constructing} an interpretable causal signal from heterogeneous micro-features that encode complementary aspects of the dynamics (momentum, volume pressure, trend acceleration, and volatility-normalized price location). The construction combines (i) causal centering, (ii) linear aggregation into a composite observable, (iii) causal stabilization via a one-dimensional Kalman filter, and (iv) an adaptive ``forward-like'' operator that mixes the composite signal with a smoothed causal derivative term. The resulting observable is mapped into a transparent decision functional and evaluated through realized cumulative returns and turnover. An application to high-frequency EURUSDT (1-minute) illustrates that causally constructed observables can exhibit substantial economic relevance in specific regimes, while degrading under subsequent regime shifts, highlighting both the potential and the limitations of causal signal design in non-stationary markets.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-enhanced Sector-based Investment Portfolio Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) from leading providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI) can be applied to quantitative sector-based portfolio construction. We use LLMs to identify investable universes of stocks within S&amp;P 500 sector indices and evaluate how their selections perform when combined with classical portfolio optimization methods. Each model was prompted to select and weight 20 stocks per sector, and the resulting portfolios were compared with their respective sector indices across two distinct out-of-sample periods: a stable market phase (January-March 2025) and a volatile phase (April-June 2025).
  Our results reveal a strong temporal dependence in LLM portfolio performance. During stable market conditions, LLM-weighted portfolios frequently outperformed sector indices on both cumulative return and risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) measures. However, during the volatile period, many LLM portfolios underperformed, suggesting that current models may struggle to adapt to regime shifts or high-volatility environments underrepresented in their training data. Importantly, when LLM-based stock selection is combined with traditional optimization techniques, portfolio outcomes improve in both performance and consistency.
  This study contributes one of the first multi-model, cross-provider evaluations of generative AI algorithms in investment management. It highlights that while LLMs can effectively complement quantitative finance by enhancing stock selection and interpretability, their reliability remains market-dependent. The findings underscore the potential of hybrid AI-quantitative frameworks, integrating LLM reasoning with established optimization techniques, to produce more robust and adaptive investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Boundary error control for numerical solution of BSDEs by the convolution-FFT method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first review the convolution fast-Fourier-transform (CFFT) approach for the numerical solution of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) introduced in (Hyndman and Oyono Ngou, 2017). We then propose a method for improving the boundary errors obtained when valuing options using this approach. We modify the damping and shifting schemes used in the original formulation, which transforms the target function into a bounded periodic function so that Fourier transforms can be applied successfully. Time-dependent shifting reduces boundary error significantly. We present numerical results for our implementation and provide a detailed error analysis showing the improved accuracy and convergence of the modified convolution method.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the generalization error for deep gradient flow methods for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for option pricing: an empirical investigation of network architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the supervised learning problem of learning the price of an option or the implied volatility given appropriate input data (model parameters) and corresponding output data (option prices or implied volatilities). The majority of articles in this literature considers a (plain) feed forward neural network architecture in order to connect the neurons used for learning the function mapping inputs to outputs. In this article, motivated by methods in image classification and recent advances in machine learning methods for PDEs, we investigate empirically whether and how the choice of network architecture affects the accuracy and training time of a machine learning algorithm. We find that the generalized highway network architecture achieves the best performance, when considering the mean squared error and the training time as criteria, within the considered parameter budgets for the Black-Scholes and Heston option pricing problems. Considering the transformed implied volatility problem, a simplified DGM variant achieves the lowest error among the tested architectures. We also carry out a capacity-normalised comparison for completeness, where all architectures are evaluated with an equal number of parameters. Finally, for the implied volatility problem, we additionally include experiments using real market data.</description>
