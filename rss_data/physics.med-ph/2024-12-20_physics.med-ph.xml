      <title>Accelerated Patient-Specific Calibration via Differentiable Hemodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the goals of personalized medicine is to tailor diagnostics to individual patients. Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring quantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a disease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers that are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be predicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models translates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the compliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such as the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a patient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters needed to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is not personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to personalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted from the data. The current methods by which this is done are either inefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to interpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a personalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes reduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take advantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for performing parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through differentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood mathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined. The performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established process on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes are successfully performed.</description>

      <title>Dual Photonics Probing of Nano- to Submicron-Scale Structural Alterations in Human Brain Tissues or Cells and Chromatin or DNA with the Progression of Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding alterations in structural disorders in tissue or cells or building blocks, such as DNA or chromatin in the human brain, at the nano to submicron level provides us with efficient biomarkers for Alzheimers detection. Here, we report a dual photonics technique to detect nano- to submicron-scale alterations in brain tissues or cells and DNA or chromatin due to the early to late progression of Alzheimers disease in humans. Using a recently developed mesoscopic light transport technique, fine-focused nano-sensitive partial wave spectroscopy (PWS), we measure the degree of structural disorder in tissues. Furthermore, the chemical-specific inverse participation ratio technique (IPR) was used to measure the DNA or chromatin structural alterations. The results of the PWS and IPR experiments showed a significant increase in the degree of structural disorder at the nano to submicron scale at different stages of AD relative to their controls for both the tissue or cell and DNA cellular levels. The increase in the structural disorder in cells or tissues and DNA or chromatin in the nuclei can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations in the tissue and DNA or chromatin damage in the nuclei caused by the rearrangements of macromolecules due to the deposition of the amyloid beta protein and damage in DNA or chromatin with the progress of AD.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of activity, attenuation and motion in respiratory-self-gated time-of-flight PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body PET imaging is often hindered by respiratory motion during acquisition, causing significant degradation in the quality of reconstructed activity images. An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the respiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET acquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we propose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of activity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated TOF PET. These methods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion and attenuation artifacts.
  The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic Wilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as 3 clinical FDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was assessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake values were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion modeling, with motion modeling but static attenuation correction, and with our proposed methods.
  For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely matching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The lesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no motion correction) to 5.2 (proposed methods), matching the contrast from the static acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with static attenuation correction yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed methods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and mitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background separation.
  Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality activity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts, without the need for external hardware.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Measurement of Lead Tip Heating in Implanted Wires with Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To theoretically and experimentally study implant lead tip heating caused by radiofrequency (RF) power deposition in different wire configurations that contain loop(s). Methods: Maximum temperature rise caused by RF heating was measured at 1.5T on 20 insulated, capped wires with various loop and straight segment configurations. The experimental results were compared with predictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation. Results: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature rise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model showing superior accuracy. For superior/inferior (S/I)-oriented wires, increasing the number of loops decreased the overall heating. However, when wires were oriented right/left (R/L) where the x-component of the electric field is negligible, additional loops increased the overall heating. Conclusion: The simple exponential and the adapted transmission line models previously developed for, and tested on, straight wires require no additional terms or further modification to account for RF heating in a variety of loop configurations. These results extend the usefulness of the models to manage implanted device lead tip heating and provide theoretical insight regarding the role of loops and electrical lengths in managing RF safety of implanted devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Exploring Offline Pileup Correction to Improve the Accuracy of Microdosimetric Characterization in Clinical Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microdosimetry investigates the energy deposition of ionizing radiation at microscopic scales, beyond the assessment capabilities of macroscopic dosimetry. This contributes to an understanding of the biological response in radiobiology, radiation protection and radiotherapy. Microdosimetric pulse height spectra are usually measured using an ionization detector in a pulsed readout mode. This incorporates and a charge-sensitive amplifier followed by a shaping network. At high particle rates, the pileup of multiple pulses leads to distortions in the recorded spectra. Especially for gas-based detectors, this is a significant issue, that can be reduced by using solid-state detectors with smaller cross-sectional areas and faster readout speeds. At particle rates typical for ion therapy, however, such devices will also experience pileup. Mitigation techniques often focus on avoiding pileup altogether, while post-processing approaches are rarely investigated. This work explores pileup effects in microdosimetric measurements and presents a stochastic resampling algorithm, allowing for offline simulation and correction of spectra. Initially it was developed for measuring neutron spectra with tissue equivalent proportional counters and is adapted for the use with solid-state microdosimeters in a clinical radiotherapy setting. The algorithm was tested on data acquired with solid-state microdosimeters at the MedAustron ion therapy facility. The successful simulation and reduction of pileup counts is achieved by establishing of a limited number of parameters for a given setup. The presented results illustrate the potential of offline correction methods in situations where a direct pileup-free measurement is currently not practicable.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of the Activity and the Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling: a Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for joint reconstruction of the activity and attenuation (JRAA) in positron emission tomography (PET) using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), which leverages diffusion models (DMs) to address activity-attenuation dependencies and mitigate crosstalk issues in non-time-of-flight (TOF) settings; experimental evaluations with 2-dimensional (2-D) XCAT phantom data show that DPS outperforms traditional maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) methods, providing consistent, high-quality reconstructions even without TOF information.</description>
