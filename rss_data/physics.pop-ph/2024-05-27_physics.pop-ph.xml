      <title>Demystifying Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific discussions of the arrow of time often get quite confusing due to highly complex systems they deal with. Popular literature then often coveys messages that tend to get lost in translation. The purpose of this note is to demystify the arrow of time by stripping off the unnecessary complexities and thereby simplifying the discussion. We do this by providing examples that are exactly solvable and make it easy to see the root cause of the apparent "time-irreversibility". We also discuss "time-reversal" solutions, where the initial state evolves such that it reaches the state which is the same as the initial state moving backward in time. These solutions are simple enough to be comprehensible to a highschooler. We discuss the arrow of time both in the classical and quantum settings, including in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Breaking news on last achievements on the definition of the black-body total internal energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal total-energy of the black-body is a physical quantity of paramount importance in the development of modern physics. Accordingly, together with a brief historical development, we report and comment last breaking news (2018-2024) concerning the definition and properties of this quantity. The first comment concerns with the inclusion of the Casimir energy that avoids the vacuum catastrophe implied by he presence of zero-point energy, thus leading to further quantum contributions associated with boundary effects. The second comment concerns with a semi-classical simulation of a one dimensional black-body whose results suggest a possible reconsideration on the role of classical physics on the quantum black-body.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 superbolide over the Iberian Peninsula: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 89.8$\pm$0.4 cm, with a density of 1660 kg/m$^{3}$, entering the atmosphere at 41.6 km/s$^{1}$ with an angle of 10.9$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 138 km and ended at an altitude of 54 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit was characterized by an inclination of 15.4$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.965, a semi-major axis of 3 au, and a notably short perihelion distance of 0.11 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Government (USG) space sensors. Our analysis shows a relatively good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 1$^\circ$ and 1.2 km/s$^{1}$, respectively. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile. The inferred bulk density and aerodynamic strength of the meteoroid from the flight model are compatible with the properties recently measured for sample-returned materials from asteroid Bennu. The physical properties and the orbital results suggest that this meteoroid originated from a recent disruption of a comet, indicating the existence of hazardous meter-sized projectiles arriving on Earth from objects formed in the distant regions of the Solar System.</description>
