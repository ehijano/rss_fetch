      <title>On the Principle of Relativity of Inertia in both General and Entangled Relativities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled Relativity is a novel theory of relativity that offers a more economical approach than General Relativity. It successfully recovers both General Relativity and standard quantum field theory within a specific (yet generic) limit. Furthermore, Entangled Relativity precludes the existence of spacetime devoid of the matter that permeates it. Consequently, I argue that Entangled Relativity is not only preferable from the standpoint of Occam's razor, due to its economical nature, but it also aligns more closely with Einstein's original vision for a satisfactory theory of relativity.</description>

      <title>Origin of cosmological density perturbations from quantum fluctuations of vacuum in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After 45 years since the discovery of quantum-gravitational birth of the cosmological density perturbations we can try to answer the main question of cosmology what is the origin of the Universe. This has become possible because the observational data are precise enough to build a physical model of the cascade relaxation of the gravitating vacuum as a generator of the evolving Universe. We present a model of the early Universe, which is inspired by the observational data in the spatial wavenumbers $k\in(2\cdot10^{-4}, 10)$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and does not require a solution of the Friedman equations. Based on observations we present a solution in the form of a vacuum attractor of General Relativity, which provides an additional power in the form of a ``bump'' and a blue spectrum of perturbations at $k&gt;10\,$Mpc$^{-1}$. Extending the power spectrum to the scale of hundreds of kiloparsecs and less can solve the problems of the observed cosmology -- the appearance of the early star formation and supermassive black holes at $z&gt;10$, the birth of primordial black holes, $\Lambda$CDM model, and others.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in rotating dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are a key observational target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The waveforms may be affected by the astrophysical environment surrounding the central black hole (BH), and in particular by the surrounding dark matter (DM) distribution. In this work, we consider the effect of a rotating DM "spike" around a central Kerr BH, and assess its detectability with LISA. Using a fully relativistic model for the rotating spike, we investigate its effect on the inspiral and hence on the emitted GW signals. We compute dephasings and mismatches to quantify how the spin of the primary BH affects the binary dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We show that the modifications due to the spin of the primary BH improve the detection prospects of DM spikes with LISA, and must be taken into account for future parameter estimation studies. We also estimate within post-Newtonian theory how the environment affects the background metric, and show that this effect is mostly negligible for the systems we consider.</description>

      <title>Non-local correlations of a test quantum field in gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations across the horizon could be pivotal in unveiling the puzzles surrounding quantum aspects of black holes and Hawking radiation. The peaks in the equal time correlation function are typically attributed to the entangled particle excitations. In this work, we have investigated the evolution of the correlations of a test quantum field on a dynamical background spacetime undergoing gravitational collapse. In the case of super-critical collapse, as the black hole and its horizon forms, correlated peaks are seen to appear across the horizon, representing an entangled Hawking pair. The outside peak moves away from the horizon as the system evolves, possibly representing outgoing Hawking flux. The implications of these non-local correlations are discussed in light of information paradox, quantum atmosphere and analogue black holes.</description>

      <title>Initial conditions for Starobinsky inflation in general quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider initial conditions leading to Starobinsky inflation in the general quadratic gravity, where the action of the theory contains one more curvature square invariant in addition to $R^2$. We have chosen corresponding coefficients in a way so that the inflationary solution keeps to be stable. Our numerical results show that despite the configuration of initial conditions in the $(H,R)$ plane, leading to Starobinsky inflation can change considerably from the $R^2$ theory, realization of inflation does not need a fine-tuning of the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mass, Charge, and Angular Momentum in Black Hole Evaporation: a Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the evaporation dynamics of Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Reissner- Nordstrom black holes, focusing on the evolution of their mass, charge, and angular momentum, using detailed calculations of the corresponding Page factors. We investigate the evolution of black holes during the evaporation process, emphasizing how these quantities evolve relative to one another. Our study incorporates the effects of greybody factors, near-extremal conditions, and the introduction of additional particle species beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that the addition of particle degrees of freedom may significantly alter the evaporation hierarchy, potentially leading to scenarios in which the effective black hole charge increases during evaporation. Additionally, we examine the impact of Schwinger pair production and of super-radiance on charged, spinning black hole evaporation. These findings offer new insights into the complex interplay between different black hole parameters during evaporation and highlight the importance of considering additional particle species in the process.</description>

      <title>Why Do We Want a Theory of Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for a new scientific theory is typically prompted by an encounter with something in the world that cannot be explained by current theories. This is not the case for the search for a theory of quantum gravity, which has been primarily motivated by theoretical and philosophical concerns. This Element introduces some of the motivations for seeking a theory of quantum gravity, with the aim of instigating a more critical perspective on how they are used in defining and constraining the theory sought. These motivations include unification, incompatibilities between general relativity and quantum field theory, consistency, singularity resolution, and results from black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Study of Wormholes in Symmetric Teleparallel Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores traversable wormhole (WH) solutions within symmetric teleparallel gravity and its extensions, including $f(Q)$ and $f(Q, T)$ gravity. Chapter I reviews WH geometry and properties, general relativity, and modified gravity's role in WH physics. Chapter II constructs WHs in $f(Q)$ gravity using dark matter profiles like Pseudo-Isothermal and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW). For linear $f(Q)$ models, suitable redshift and shape functions satisfying the flare-out condition yield viable WHs, with the monopole charge $\eta$ driving Null Energy Condition (NEC) violation. The Volume Integral Quantifier (VIQ) method shows minimal exotic matter is needed. Nonlinear models like $f(Q) = Q + m Q^n$ fail to meet WH criteria. Chapter III studies $f(Q, T)$ gravity, where $Q$ and the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor are coupled. WHs are examined under barotropic and anisotropic equations of state using forms like $f(Q, T) = \alpha Q + \beta T$ and $f(Q, T) = Q + \lambda_1 Q^2 + \eta_1 T$. NEC violations occur near the throat, indicating effective matter-geometry coupling. Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) analysis confirms equilibrium under suitable parameters. Chapter IV employs the MIT bag model in $f(Q, T)$ gravity, treating it as a source of exotic matter. Specific shape functions lead to WHs with NEC violation and TOV-based stability under radial perturbations. Chapter V considers WHs in $f(Q, T)$ gravity with noncommutative geometries inspired by string theory. Gaussian and Lorentzian smeared sources are used. Linear models yield analytical WH solutions, nonlinear ones are numerical. All satisfy the flare-out condition and exhibit NEC violation. Gravitational lensing analysis reveals distinguishable features from black holes. Chapter VI summarizes the results, emphasizing observational prospects in extended gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>Ghost-induced phase transition in the final stages of black hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a novel scenario in which a quantum-induced ghost instability drives the natural evolution of an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole toward a stable naked singularity. This process, arising from quadratic curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies, circumvents the inconsistencies associated with classical naked singularities. The onset of ghost-driven instability signals a phase transition that fundamentally alters black hole evaporation, rendering the information paradox moot as it merges with the singularity issue. Our findings suggest a new pathway for black hole evolution at high-energy scales, offering insights that may bridge key gaps until a full theory of quantum gravity is realized.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of probing Bopp-Land{\'e}-Thomas-Podolsky generalized electrodynamics with traveling and standing wave experiments. We consider wave propagation in vacuum and in a cold and non-magnetized plasma. Dispersion relations are found for all possible transverse and longitudinal modes.

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational collapse in pure Gauss- Bonnet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational collapse of matter fields, which include dust, perfect fluids as well as fluids admitting bulk and shear viscosity. The initial conditions on these matter fields have been kept to be quite general: the initial velocity profile of the matter is taken to include both the bound and the marginally bound models, while the density profile of the initial matter configuration is assumed to have physically admissible portrayal, and smooth falloffs. We determine, under these general conditions, the time of formation of the central singularity and the formation and evolution of black hole horizons, depicted here in terms of quasilocal marginally trapped surfaces. Our study shows that under these general conditions, the central singularity remains hidden from the asymptotic observer.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and Electromagnetic Discrepancies between Neutron Star and Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exterior spacetime geometry surrounding an uncharged, spinning black hole in general relativity depends only upon its mass and spin. However, the exterior geometry surrounding any other rotating compact object, for example a neutron star, will generally depend upon higher moments in its multipole expansion, which will in turn be dependent upon the object's equation of state. Using general relativistic hydrodynamics and electrodynamics simulations, we illustrate that the presence or absence of these higher moments (assuming a physically realistic neutron star equation of state) has a significant qualitative effect near the surface of the compact object on the dynamics of unmagnetized accretion, and a smaller quantitative effect on the electromagnetic field configuration of its magnetosphere. In some places, the discrepancies in energy-momentum density are found to reach or exceed 50%, with electric field strength discrepancies in excess of 10%. We argue that many of these differences are likely to be amplified by the inclusion of more sophisticated plasma physics models, and are therefore likely to be relevant for the dynamics of gravitational collapse, and potentially also for particle acceleration and jet launching. These discrepancies suggest important limitations regarding the use of the Kerr metric when performing numerical simulations around neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the foundations of Metric-Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reassess foundational aspects of Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG) in light of the Dressing Field Method, a tool allowing to systematically build gauge-invariant field variables. To get MAG started, one has to deal with the problem of "gauge translations". We first recall that Cartan geometry is the proper mathematical foundation for gauge theories of gravity, and that this problem never arises in that framework, which still allows to clarify the geometric status of gauge translations. Then, we show how the MAG kinematics is obtained via dressing in a technically streamlined way, which highlights that it reduces to a Cartan-geometric kinematics.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Search with ABRACADABRA-10\,cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ABRACADABRA-10 cm has had great success as a pathfinder lumped-element axion dark matter experiment, setting limits on axion dark matter at the GUT scale. Now, using the interaction of gravitational waves with electrodynamics and a change in readout strategy, we use the ABRA-10 cm detector for the first search for high-frequency gravitational waves using a modified axion detector. Potential sources at these high frequencies (10 kHz to 5 MHz) include merging primordial black hole binaries or superradiance, among other beyond the standard model phenomena. This paper presents the design, results, and challenges from the ABRA-10 cm high-frequency gravitational wave search, showing it is possible to simultaneously look for axions and high-frequency gravitational waves with both searches matching theoretical expectations for sensitivity. Additionally, we conducted the first time series transient search with data from an axion experiment, achieving sensitivity to $10^{-4}$ in strain. Scaled directly to the next generation axion experiment, DMRadio-GUT, this sensitivity would imply a reach to 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ primordial black hole mergers at distances around 3 pc, with prospects to go significantly further with modifications to the readout.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Vacuum Fields to Cavity with Diffraction Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave detector DECIGO employs a 1000 km-long Fabry-Perot cavity, which introduces significant diffraction loss. Previous studies accounted or diffraction loss by modeling it as a reduction in laser power for sensitivity calculations. In this research, we take an optical approach by explicitly considering the impact of vacuum fields introduced through diffraction loss, including leakage loss and higher-order mode loss, as well as mirror optical loss. By formulating input-output relations that incorporate these vacuum fields in a realistic cavity with diffraction loss and an optical spring, we achieve a more precise evaluation of DECIGO's optical response. This analysis provides new insights into how diffraction loss affects quantum-locking techniques, offering a refined framework for improving DECIGO's optical design and sensitivity estimation.</description>

      <title>Is spacetime curved? Assessing the underdetermination of general relativity and teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realism about general relativity (GR) seems to imply realism about spacetime curvature. The existence of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) calls this into question, for (a) TEGR is set in a torsionful but flat spacetime, and (b) TEGR is empirically equivalent to GR. Knox (2011) claims that there is no genuine underdetermination between GR and TEGR; we call this verdict into question by isolating and addressing her individual arguments. In addition, we anticipate and evaluate two further worries for realism about the torsionful spacetimes of TEGR, which we call the "problem of operationalisability" and the "problem of visualisability".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for relaxing a gauge theory CP violating phase in discrete steps to very small values. The idea is that the CP violating phase includes the magnetic dual of a $4$-form flux which can discharge by the nucleation of membranes. Inside the bubbles surrounded by the membranes, the total CP violating phase is reduced. When the bubbles are produced rapidly during radiation domination in the early universe, near the chiral symmetry breaking scale, they will collide and percolate, melting away into gauge theory radiation and dramatically relaxing CP violation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present orthogonality relations for quasinormal modes of a wide class of asymptotically AdS black holes. The definition is obtained from a standard product, modified by a CPT operator and placed on a complex radial contour which avoids branch points of the modes. They are inspired by existing constructions for de Sitter and Kerr spacetimes. The CPT operator is needed to map right eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian into left eigenfunctions. The radial contour connects two copies of the dual QFT on a thermal Schwinger-Keldysh contour, making contact with real-time holography and the double cone wormhole.</description>

      <title>PT2GWFinder: A Package for Cosmological First-Order Phase Transitions and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole and neutron star mergers by ground-based interferometers, as well as the evidence for a gravitational wave background from pulsar timing array experiments, has marked a new era in astrophysics and cosmology. These experiments also have great potential for discovering new physics through gravitational wave detection. One of the most motivated sources of gravitational waves that can be realized only within the beyond-the-Standard-Model framework is first-order phase transitions. In this work we release PT2GWFinder, a Mathematica package designed to compute phase transition parameters and the gravitational wave power spectrum for an arbitrary scalar theory exhibiting a first-order phase transition in a single direction. PT2GWFinder performs the phase tracing, computes the bounce profile and action using FindBounce, calculates the relevant temperatures and phase transition parameters, and finally evaluates the gravitational wave spectrum. Additionally, it offers a user-friendly interface with DRalgo, which enables the computation of the dimensionally reduced effective potential in the high-temperature regime. This work includes a user manual and two models that demonstrate the capability and performance of PT2GWFinder. As a supplement, for one of these models we obtain the bounce solution and action analytically in the thin-wall approximation and demonstrate excellent agreement with the numerical approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of two one-form topological matter fields minimally coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime using the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism. Working in the full phase space, we systematically identify the complete set of constraints of the system, classify them into first- and second-class, and compute their Poisson bracket algebra. The constraint analysis confirms the absence of physical degrees of freedom, consistent with the system's topological character. Furthermore, we construct the generating functional for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, with appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the theory. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>Probing the multipolar structure of Myers-Perry black holes with scattering amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the scattering of massive scalar probes off Myers-Perry black holes in the Kerr-Schild gauge. Extending the analysis performed recently for Kerr(-Newman) black holes, we show that the Kerr-Schild gauge allows to write down the tree-level scattering amplitude for Myers-Perry black holes in analytic form. For generic values of the angular momenta, Myers-Perry solutions have a richer multipolar structure compared to their four-dimensional counterparts, because they are characterized by the presence of stress multipoles, together with the more familiar mass and current multipoles. By focusing on the five-dimensional case, we derive the leading eikonal phase from the scattering amplitude and we give an explicit expression for two limiting scenari, namely when the two angular momenta are the same, so that the mass multipoles vanish but still the solution has a non-vanishing stress quadrupole and a current dipole, and when one of the two angular momenta is zero, and correspondingly the stress multipoles vanish similar to the Kerr case.</description>

      <title>Constraints Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction for Relativistic Hydrodynamics with General Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of relativistic astrophysics, the ideal equation of state with a constant adiabatic index provides a poor approximation due to its inconsistency with relativistic kinetic theory. However, it is a common practice to use it for relativistic fluid flow equations due to its simplicity. Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky like inflation and EGB Gravity in the light of ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ACT data shows an enhancement in the value of the scalar spectral index, as $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, leading to disfavoring many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky model. To satisfy the constraint made by ACT, we will investigate the Starobinsky potential within the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet(EGB) gravity theory. EGB gravity is motivated by the higher-dimensional theory, which includes quadratic curvature correction terms and a coupling between the scalar field and the GB term that modifies the dynamical equations. The model is considered by using the slow-roll approximation method and the exact numerical approach for two different coupling functions. The results indicate that the model is in good agreement with the data and the results stand in $1\sigma$ of the ACT $r-n_s$ plane. Considering the running of the scalar spectral index also implies the consistency of the model with data. In addition, the parametric space of the free parameters of the EGB coupling is explored, where we find the acceptable region of the parameters in which the resulting $n_s$ and $r$ stay in $1\sigma$ of the ACT data. Next, the reheating phase is considered. It is determined that the model can simultaneously satisfy the constraint of ACT data and the reheating temperature constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 3D and 4D asymptotically flat spacetimes near future null infinity endowed with the most general allowed Carroll geometry. We define a boundary energy-momentum tensor by varying the on-shell action with respect to the Carroll metric data. This requires adding counterterms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that, in 4D, the shear is on par with the Carroll metric data. Their combined response defines a boundary energy-momentum-news complex whose diffeomorphism Ward identity is equivalent to the Bondi mass and angular momentum loss equations. Weyl invariance leads to an identity for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and local Carroll boosts are anomalous in 3D and in 4D.</description>

Abstract: We study the stress-energy tensor of a massless, conformally coupled, quantum scalar field in a rigidly-rotating thermal state on three- and four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space-time. We first find the stress-energy tensor using relativistic kinetic theory, modelling the field as a thermal gas of massless bosons. We then compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the scalar field in quantum field theory and compare it with that resulting from relativistic kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Screened Axio-dilaton Cosmology: Novel Forms of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of multi-field Dark Energy, using a well-motivated axio-dilaton model that contains the minimal number of fields to have the 2-derivative sigma-model interactions that power-counting arguments show naturally compete with General Relativity at low energies. Our analysis differs from earlier, related, studies by treating the case where the dilaton's couplings to matter are large enough to require screening to avoid unacceptable dilaton-mediated forces in the solar system. We use a recently proposed screening mechanism that exploits the interplay between stronger-than-gravitational axion-matter couplings with the 2-derivative axion-dilaton interactions to suppress the couplings of the dilaton to bulk matter. The required axion-matter couplings also modify cosmology, with the axion's background energy density turning out to resemble early dark energy. We compute the properties of the axion fluid describing the rapid oscillations of the axion field around the time-dependent minimum of its matter-dependent effective potential, extending the usual formalism to include nontrivial kinetic sigma-model interactions. We explore the implications of these models for the Cosmic Microwave Background and the growth of structure and find that for dilaton potentials of the Albrecht-Skordis form (itself well-motivated by UV physics), successful screening can be consistent with the early dark energy temporarily comprising as much as 10% of the total density in the past. We find that increasing the dilaton-matter coupling decreases the growth of structure due to enhanced Hubble friction, an effect that dominates the usual fifth-force effects that amplify structure growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a new and deeply challenging face of the problem of time in the context of cosmology drawing on the work of Thiemann (2006, 2007). Thiemann argues for a radical response to the cosmic problem of time that requires us to modify the classical Friedmann equations. By contrast, we offer a conservative proposal for solution of the problem by bringing together ideas from the contemporary literature regarding reference frames (Bamonti 2023; Bamonti and Gomes 2024), complete observables (Gryb and Th\'ebault 2016b; Gryb and Th\'ebault 2023), and the model-based account of time measurement (Tal 2016). On our approach, we must reinterpret our criteria of observability in light of the clock hypothesis and the model-based account of measurement in order to preserve the Friedmann equations as the dynamical equations for the universe.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific research comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a measurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how confident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are obtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings of ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical methods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates and auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a framework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors. In this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context of glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification algorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to convert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous uncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance of different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our results show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific application, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.</description>

      <title>How does non-metricity affect particle creation and evaporation in bumblebee gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the impact of non-metricity on particle creation and the evaporation process of black holes within the framework of bumblebee gravity. In general lines, we compare black holes in the metric formalism [1] and the metric-affine approach [2]. Initially, we focus on bosonic particle modes to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, we compute the Bogoliubov coefficients and derive the Hawking temperature. Subsequently, we examine Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, resolving divergent integrals through the residue method. The analysis is then extended to fermionic particle modes, also within the tunneling framework. Particle creation densities are calculated for both bosonic and fermionic cases. Additionally, greybody bounds are estimated for bosonic and fermionic particles. Furthermore, we explore the evaporation process, considering the final state of the black holes and we also investigate the correlation between the greybody factors and the quasinormal modes. Finally, constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameters $\ell$ (for the metric case) and $X$ (for the metric-affine case) are established using recent astrophysical data on black hole lifetimes. In a general panorama, non-metricity (except for the tensor perturbations) in bumblebee gravity raises particle density for bosons while reducing it for fermions, increases greybody factors (for both bosons and fermions), amplifies the emission rate, and accelerates the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced radiation from a qudit particle detector model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We nonperturbatively examine the emission rate of acceleration-induced radiation from a uniformly accelerated gapless qudit-type Unruh-DeWitt detector. We find that the emission rate can be written as Larmor's formula multiplied by a factor that depends on the detector's initial state. In particular, certain initial states of integer-spin detectors do not produce radiation. Although the appearance of Larmor's formula may suggest a classical phenomenon, we argue that the resulting radiation is fundamentally distinct from that of structureless classical sources, as it evolves into a multimode coherent state correlated with the detector's internal degree of freedom. Thus, gapless detectors cannot be treated as structureless sources, as previously proposed.</description>

      <title>Entropy correction and quasinormal modes of slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tunneling of fermion particle for slowly rotating Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like (KNdS-like) black hole in bumblebee gravity model by applying the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The Hawking temperature of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole has been modified under GUP. The quantum gravity effect reduces the rise of Hawking temperature of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole. The modified Hawking temperature and the correction of black hole entropy are investigated by using the tunneling of fermion beyond the semiclassical approximation. We study the scalar field perturbation and effective potential of slowly rotating KNdS-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model by using Klein-G\"{o}rdon equation. The quasinormal modes for scalar perturbation is investigated using WKB approximation method and P{\"o}schl-Teller fitting method. The significant impact on the greybody factor, Hawking spectra and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the black hole are also studied in the presence of Lorentz violating parameter L.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical analysis of the null and timelike geodesics around an asymptotically de Sitter wormhole in a Randall-Sundrum brane. In this framework, the wormhole throat is interpreted both as a photon sphere and as a fixed point of the associated dynamical system. The stability of this structure is evaluated using Lyapunov and Jacobi criteria with consistent results. A Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation is observed in the null-geodesic dynamics, highlighting critical changes in the behavior of light around the wormhole. Explicit solutions are derived for geodesics near the throat, providing insight into the optical appearance of the wormhole shadow. These results show qualitatively similar behavior for null and timelike orbits, suggesting universal features of geodesic dynamics in brane-de Sitter wormholes.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. Power counting suggests that our theory could be renormalised in all orders of perturbative expansion. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Probing de Sitter Space Using CFT States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a massive self-interacting scalar quantum field in a Lorentz-violation scenario based on a Horava-Lifshitz model. Specifically, we investigate the vacuum energy density and its loop correction, up to first order in the self-interaction coupling constant, and also the topological mass generation. These quantities are also analyzed in the case where the field is massless. The scalar vacuum state is perturbed by the presence of two large parallel plates, placed at a distance L from each other, due to the imposition of Dirichlet boundary condition on the two plates. To perform this study, the effective potential approach in quantum field theory is applied.</description>

      <title>RPST-Inspired Formalism for Black Holes in Flat Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel formalism for the thermodynamics of flat black holes, inspired by the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) framework. Our construction is motivated by the observed similarities in the thermodynamic behavior of flat black holes within the R\'enyi entropy framework and that of AdS black holes described by the Bekenstein entropy regime. The RPST framework is, by construction, exclusive to AdS black holes because it depends on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which is linked to the central charge $C$ of the dual conformal field theory (CFT). However, for non-AdS black holes, where $\Lambda$ is absent, we introduce a deformation parameter $\lambda$ to replace the central charge $C$. This RPST-inspired formalism incorporates $\lambda$ and its conjugate variable, the response potential $\zeta$, as a new pair of thermodynamic variables, analogous to the central charge $C$ and chemical potential $\mu$ in the AdS case. To illustrate the applicability of this formalism, we analyze two examples: the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) flat black hole and the Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves in light of Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</description>

Abstract: In general the speed of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in Scalar-Tensor modifications of Einstein's gravity is different from the speed of Light. Nevertheless, it has been measured that their speeds are nearly the same. For the most general Scalar-Tensor theories classified to date that do propagate a graviton -- DHOST, {\it including Horndeski and Beyond Horndeski (BH) theories} -- we show that, remarkably, up to 5 self-consistent couplings of the scalar of Dark Energy (DE) to the Photon are enough to make their GWs luminal in a wide set of cases. We find at least one Luminal Beyond Horndeski theory for which the GW decay into Dark Energy is suppressed in any cosmological background.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Conformal Dimensions On Causal Random Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between matter and causal dynamical triangulations (CDT) in the context of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We focus on the Ising model coupled to CDT, contrasting this with Liouville gravity and the relation to the Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) formula. We demonstrate analytically for the quenched model that the conformal dimensions of fields on CDT align with those on a fixed lattice. We do this using a combination of lattice methods and adapting the Duplantier-Sheffield framework to CDT, emphasizing the one-dimensional nature of CDT and its description via a stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Questioning Cosmic Acceleration with DESI: The Big Stall of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important discoveries in modern cosmology is cosmic acceleration. However, we find that today's universe could decelerate in the statistically preferred Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) scenario over the $\Lambda$CDM model by cosmic microwave background, type Ia supernova and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Using various datasets, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we demonstrate that the universe experiences a triple deceleration during its evolution and finally reaches the state of the ``Big Stall", which predicts that: (i) the universe suddenly comes to a halt in the distant future; (ii) its eventual destiny is dominated by dark matter rather than dark energy ; (iii) it ultimately retains an extremely small fraction of dark energy but exerts an extremely large pressure. Our findings profoundly challenge the established understanding of cosmic acceleration and enrich our comprehension of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmology inside a black hole: adding matter on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braneworlds inside an AdS black hole provide simple models where a closed cosmology can be encoded in a dual field theory. Previous studies have focused on pure-tension branes, where the only matter in the cosmology is that dual to the holographic bulk. We consider models with additional explicit matter fields on the brane. Both for perfect fluid matter and for an axion field on the brane, we show that this can avoid a self-intersection problem in the Euclidean construction of such geometries in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Simple Holography in General Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simple or "outermost" wedge in AdS is the portion of the entanglement wedge that can be reconstructed with sub-exponential effort from CFT data. Here we furnish a definition in arbitrary spacetimes: given an input wedge $a$ analogous to a CFT boundary region, the simple wedge $z(a)$ is the largest wedge accessible by a "zigzag," a certain sequence of antinormal lightsheets. We show that $z(a)$ is a throat, and that it is contained in every other throat. This implies that $z(a)$ is unique; that it is contained in the generalized entanglement wedge; and that it reduces to the AdS prescription as a special case.
  The zigzag explicitly constructs a preferred Cauchy slice that renders the simple wedge accessible from $a$; thus it adds a novel structure even in AdS. So far, no spacelike construction is known to reproduce these results, even in time-symmetric settings. This may have implications for the modeling of holographic encoding by tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Hot Holographic 2-flavor Quark Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the holographic 2-flavor Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model, the parameters of which fixed by lattice QCD, we extract the equations of state for hot quark-gluon plasma around the critical point at $T=182$ MeV, and have corresponding quark star cores constructed. By further adding hadron shells, the mass range of the whole stars spans from 2 to 17 solar masses, with the maximum compactness around 0.15. This result allows them to be black hole mimickers and candidates for gap events. The I-Love-Q-C relations are also analyzed, which show consistency with the neutron star cases when the discontinuity at the quark-hadron interface is not large. Besides, we illustrate the full parameter maps of the energy density and pressure as functions of the temperature and chemical potential, and discuss the constant thermal conductivity case supposing a heat source inside.</description>
