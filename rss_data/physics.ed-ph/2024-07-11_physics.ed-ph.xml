      <title>Quantum Technology masters: A shortcut to the quantum industry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum Technology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters programs, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a job in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a doctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs, with substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly interdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree programs, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies. Information from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended career destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and therefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum technologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the quantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which augment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may further contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route to the quantum industry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Subfield Interest Development in Undergraduate Physics Students through Social Cognitive Career Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to understand how undergraduate physics majors develop an interest in specific subfields. We examine interest formation through the lens of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) by exploring four key SCCT constructs: learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and proximal environmental influences. We conducted 27 interviews with physics majors across various years of study between 2020 and 2022. Our first research question analyzes SCCT constructs to provide detailed insights into the interest formation of various subfields of physics. Examining these constructs, we better understand the factors influencing students' preferences toward specific subfields. Our findings indicate that positive class experiences and experimental opportunities significantly impacted students' interest in different subfields of physics. This understanding helped us explore significant variations in interest formation between astrophysics and biomedical physics in Research Question 2. By understanding how students decide about their interests, we can provide valuable insights for physics departments and career guidance professionals.</description>
