      <title>Evidence for the evolution and decay of an electrified Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances during two consecutive substorms: First results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrified Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (EMSTIDs) is one of the prominent plasma structures that affect the propagation of high frequency radio waves. Overall, seasonal variation and propagation characteristics of the EMSTIDs are widely reported in literature. However, the effects of substorms on the formation and dissipation of the EMSTIDs are not well explored. In the present study, on a moderately geomagnetically active night of 26 October 2019 (Ap=24), the airglow imager over Hanle (32.7{\deg}N, 78.9{\deg}E; Mlat. ~24.1{\deg}N), India recorded the evolution and decay of an EMSTID in the O(1D) 630.0 nm airglow images in between 13.3 UT and 15.8 UT. In addition, during the same time, a steep rise and fall of the virtual base height of the ionospheric F-layer were also recorded by a nearby digisonde over New Delhi (28.70{\deg}N, 77.10{\deg}E; Mlat. ~20.2{\deg}N). The most important aspect of the event was the occurrence of the two consecutive substorms in between 13.3 UT and 15.8 UT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind study where we report the role of interplanetary electric field (IEF) and substorm induced electric fields on the evolution and decay of the EMSTID. This study elicits effects of the externally imposed electric fields on the mid-latitude ionospheric plasma structures and provides insight into the complex coupling between auroral and low-mid latitude region.</description>

      <title>May 11-12 Extreme Space Weather Events Brief and Dose Rate Model Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this brief paper, we analyze space weather events that occurred on May 11 and 12, 2024, from the perspective of an operational space weather center that provides advisories for civil aviation. One of the key metrics monitored by the center is the radiation dose rate at operational flight altitudes. A model implemented by the center provides the dose rate in real time. The model showed that dangerous levels were momentarily exceeded just above the usual 30,000 feet level during the events. This paper highlights differences in models used by various space weather centers, emphasizing the need for harmonization.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Events and Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) and radio bursts are indicators of particle acceleration on the Sun and in the heliosphere. The accelerated particles have energies significantly higher than thermal particles up to several orders of magnitude. SEPs are detected directly by particle detectors on Earth and in space. Understanding SEPs is important from both science and application points of view because they are poorly understood and present space weather hazard to humans and their technology in space. SEPs accompany energetic flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and intense radio bursts, which help us understand particle properties such as intensity, spectra, and time evolution. This paper summarizes how SEP properties are closely related to solar eruptions and the associated solar radio bursts.</description>
