      <title>Global Ricci Curvature Behaviour for the K\"ahler-Ricci Flow with Finite Time Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the K\"ahler-Ricci flow $(X, \omega(t))_{t \in [0,T)}$ on a compact manifold where the time of singularity, $T$, is finite. We assume the existence of a holomorphic map from the K\"ahler manifold $X$ to some analytic variety $Y$ which admits a K\"ahler metric on a neighbourhood of the image of $X$ and that the pullback of this metric yields the limiting cohomology class along the flow. This is satisfied, for instance, by the assumption that the initial cohomology class is rational, i.e., $[\omega_0] \in H^{1,1}(X,\mathbb{Q})$. Under these assumptions we prove an $L^4$-like estimate on the behaviour of the Ricci curvature and that the Riemannian curvature is Type $I$ in the $L^2$-sense.</description>

      <title>Screen Generic Lightlike Submanifolds of a Locally Bronze Semi-Riemannian Manifold equipped with an (l,m)-type Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper introduces the geometry of screen generic lightlike submanifolds of a locally bronze semi-Riemannian manifolds endowed with an (l,m)-type connection. The characterization theorems on geodesicity of such submanifolds with respect to the integrability and parallelism of the distributions are provided. It is proved that there exists no coisotropic , isotropic or totally proper screen generic lightlike submanifold of a locally bronze semi-Riemannian manifold. Assertions for the smooth transversal vector fields in totally umbilical proper screen generic lightlike submanifold are obtained. The structure of a minimal screen generic lightlike submanifold of a locally bronze semi-Riemannian manifold is detailed with an example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We study analytic torsion and eta like invariants on CR contact manifolds of any dimension admitting a circle transverse action, and equipped with a unitary representation. We show that, when defined using the spectrum of relevant operators arising in this geometry, the spectral series involved can been interpreted in their whole, both from a topological viewpoint, and as purely dynamical functions of the Reeb flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A Corrected Proof of the Graphical Representation of a Class of Curvature Varifolds by $C^{1,\alpha}$ Multiple Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a counter-example to Hutchinson's original proof of $C^{1,\alpha}$ representation of curvature $m$-varifolds with $L^q$-integrable second fundamental form and $q&gt;m$ in [6]. We also provide an alternative proof of the same result and introduce a method of decomposing varifolds into nested components preserving weakly differentiability of a given function. Furthermore, we prove the structure theorem for curvature varifolds with null second fundamental form which is widely used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Examples of tangent cones of non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give new examples of manifolds that appear as cross sections of tangent cones of non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces. It was shown by Colding-Naber that the homeomorphism types of the tangent cones of a fixed point of such a space do not need to be unique. In fact, they constructed an example in dimension 5 where two different homeomorphism types appear at the same point. In this note, we extend this result and construct limit spaces in all dimensions at least 5 where any finite collection of manifolds that admit core metrics, a type of metric introduced by Perelman and Burdick to study Riemannian metrics of positive Ricci curvature on connected sums, can appear as cross sections of tangent cones of the same point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the travel time in a navigation problem from a geometric perspective. The setting involves an open subset of the Euclidean plane, representing a lake perturbed by a symmetric wind flow proportional to the distance from the origin. The Randers metric derived from this physical problem generalizes the well-known Euclidean metric on the Cartesian plane and the Funk metric on the unit disk. We obtain formulas for distances, or travel times, from point to point, from point to line, and vice-versa</description>

      <title>On four-dimensional Dehn twists and Milnor fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the monodromy diffeomorphism of Milnor fibrations of isolated complex surface singularities, by computing the family Seiberg--Witten invariant of Seifert-fibered Dehn twists using recent advances in monopole Floer homology. More precisely, we establish infinite order non-triviality results for boundary Dehn twists on indefinite symplectic fillings of links of minimally elliptic surface singularities. Using this, we exhibit a wide variety of new phenomena in dimension four: (1) smoothings of isolated complex surface singularities whose Milnor fibration has monodromy with infinite order as a diffeomorphism but with finite order as a homeomorphism, (2) robust Torelli symplectomorphisms that do not factor as products of Dehn--Seidel twists, (3) compactly supported exotic diffeomorphisms of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s and contractible manifolds.</description>

      <title>Drinfel'd Doubles, Twists and All That... in Stringy Geometry and M Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drinfel'd double of Lie bialgebroids plays an important role in T-duality of string theories. In the presence of $H$ and $R$ fluxes, Lie bialgebroids should be extended to proto Lie bialgebroids. For both cases, the pair is given by two dual vector bundles, and the Drinfel'd double yields a Courant algebroid. However for U-duality, more complicated direct sum decompositions that are not described by dual vector bundles appear. In a previous work, we extended the notion of a Lie bialgebroid for vector bundles that are not necessarily dual. We achieved this by introducing a framework of calculus on algebroids and examining compatibility conditions for various algebroid properties in this framework. Here our aim is two-fold: extending our work on bialgebroids to include both $H$- and $R$-twists, and generalizing proto Lie bialgebroids to pairs of arbitrary vector bundles. To this end, we analyze various algebroid axioms and derive twisted compatibility conditions in the presence of twists. We introduce the notion of proto bialgebroids and their Drinfel'd doubles, where the former generalizes both bialgebroids and proto Lie bialgebroids. We also examine the most general form of vector bundle automorphisms of the double, related to twist matrices, that generate a new bracket from a given one. We analyze various examples from both physics and mathematics literatures in our framework.</description>

      <title>The versal deformation of Kurke-LeBrun manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twistor spaces are certain compact complex threefolds with an additional real fibre bundle structure. We focus here on twistor spaces over $3\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$. Such spaces are either small resolutions of double solids or they can be described as modifications of conic bundles. The last type is the more special one: they deform into double solids. We give an explicit description of this deformation, in a more general context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>Curl through spin on three-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decades, many mathematicians have studied the {\em curl operator} on compact (both with or without empty boundary) three-manifolds, mainly the behaviour of its spectrum and some iso\-pe\-ri\-me\-tric problems associated with it. In this paper, we reveal an (unexpected?) relation between this curl operator and the Dirac operator correspondingto any of the spin$^c$ structures on the manifold. Then, we make the ellipticity of $D$ (curl is not) and the many facts already known about the spectrum of $D$ to recuperate with almost immediate proofs some results above curl and obtain others unknown for me. {\em For example, we will find that the eigenvalues of curl, removing the point spectrum zero, are always, up to a fixed constant, lower bounded by those of the Dirac and the equality characterize the round three-sphere}. Also, we also show that {\em there do not exist mean-convex $L^2$-solutions for the isoperimetric problem associated to curl}, as Cantarella, de Turck, Gluck y Teytel \cite{CdTGT} had conjectured, while other authors proved properties for these unknown solutions (adding always whether optimal domains exist) perhaps by thinking in the case of the successful maximization of the {\em helicity.}</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish curvature estimates for anisotropic Gauss curvature flows. By using this, we show that given a measure $\mu$ with a positive smooth density $f$, any solution to the $L_p$ Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $p \le -n+2$ is a hypersurface of class $C^{1,1}$. This is a sharp result because for each $p\in [-n+2,1)$ there exists a convex hypersurface of class $C^{1,\frac{1}{n+p-1}}$ which is a solution to the $L_p$ Minkowski problem for a positive smooth density $f$. In particular, the $C^{1,1}$ regularity is optimal in the case $p=-n+2$ which includes the logarithmic Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results on the number of solutions to the asymptotic Plateau problem in $\mathbb H^3$. Firstly we discuss criteria that ensure uniqueness. Given a Jordan curve $\Lambda$ in the asymptotic boundary of $\mathbb H^3$, we show that uniqueness of the minimal surfaces with asymptotic boundary $\Lambda$ is equivalent to uniqueness in the smaller class of stable minimal disks. Then we show that if a quasicircle (or more generally, a Jordan curve of finite width) $\Lambda$ is the asymptotic boundary of a minimal surface $\Sigma$ with principal curvatures less than or equal to 1 in absolute value, then uniqueness holds. In the direction of non-uniqueness, we construct an example of a quasicircle that is the asymptotic boundary of uncountably many pairwise distinct stable minimal disks.</description>

Abstract: We prove that on the product of two Riemannian manifolds one of which is compact, any Killing tensor is reducible, that is, is the sum of products of Killing tensors on the factors. The same is true for the lifts to the universal cover of Killing tensors on a compact manifold with reducible holonomy. We give a local description of Killing tensors on product manifolds and present an example of a complete product manifold whose factors are locally irreducible which admits an irreducible Killing tensor field.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture on several special types of Hermitian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of compact Hermitian manifolds, including Chern flat manifolds and non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel manifolds. The latter contains Vaisman manifolds as a subset. We also discuss the situation of compact quotients of Lie groups which is either almost ableian or whose Lie algebra contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of a codimension $2$, both are covered by the powerful theorem of Fino and Kasuya which states that Streets-Tian Conjecture holds for all solvmanifolds of completely solvable type. We gave an alternative and explicit approach here, which helps to illustrate the algebraic complexity and subtlety of Streets-Tian Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On construction of k-regular maps to Grassmannians via algebras of socle dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous map $\mathbb{C}^n\to Gr(\tau, N)$ is $k$-regular if the $\tau$-dimensional subspaces corresponding to images of any $k$ distinct points span a $\tau k$-dimensional space. For $\tau = 1$ this essentially recovers the classical notion of a $k$-regular map $\mathbb{C}^n\to \mathbb{C}^N$. We provide new examples of $k$-regular maps, both in the classical setting $\tau = 1$ and for $\tau\geq 2$, where these are the first examples known. Our methods come from algebraic geometry, following and generalizing Buczy\'{n}ski-Januszkiewicz-Jelisiejew-Micha{\l}ek. The key and highly nontrivial part of the argument is proving that certain loci of the Hilbert scheme of points have expected dimension. As an important side result, we prove irreducibility of the punctual Hilbert scheme of $k$ points on a threefold, for $k\leq 11$.</description>

      <title>Adversarial attacks on neural networks through canonical Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial learning is therefore becoming a crucial task. We propose a new vision on neural network robustness using Riemannian geometry and foliation theory. The idea is illustrated by creating a new adversarial attack that takes into account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack, called the two-step spectral attack is a piece-wise linear approximation of a geodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (degenerate) Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite and its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is derived from this kernel. The curvature of transverse leaves gives the appropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and hence a new efficient adversarial attack. The method is first illustrated on a 2D toy example in order to visualize the neural network foliation and the corresponding attacks. Next, we report numerical results on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets with the proposed technique and state of the art attacks presented in Zhao et al. (2019) (OSSA) and Croce et al. (2020) (AutoAttack). The result show that the proposed attack is more efficient at all levels of available budget for the attack (norm of the attack), confirming that the curvature of the transverse neural network FIM foliation plays an important role in the robustness of neural networks. The main objective and interest of this study is to provide a mathematical understanding of the geometrical issues at play in the data space when constructing efficient attacks on neural networks.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic classes of geodesic flows on rank 1 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a $C^{1+\beta}$ flow $\varphi$ with positive speed on a closed smooth Riemannian manifold, we code two homoclinically related $\varphi$-invariant probabilities by an irreducible countable topological Markov flow. As an application, we give proofs using symbolic dynamics of the theorem of Knieper on the uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy and theorems of Burns et al on the uniqueness of equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Current Algebra and Generalised Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor. As an application, we use this framework to phrase sigma model dynamics in an explicitly covariant way -- both under generalised diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>The decoupling of moduli about the standard embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of an elliptic differential complex arising from the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic string theory. We compute these cohomology groups at the standard embedding, and show that they decompose into a direct sum of cohomologies. While this is often assumed in the literature, it had not been explicitly demonstrated. Given a stable gauge bundle over a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and no holomorphic vector fields, we also show that the Euler characteristic of this differential complex is zero. This points towards a perfect obstruction theory for the heterotic moduli problem, at least for the most physically relevant compactifications.</description>

      <title>Curvature and local matchings of conference graphs and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture of Bonini et. al. on the precise Lin-Lu-Yau curvature values of conference graphs, i.e., strongly regular graphs with parameters $(4\gamma+1,2\gamma,\gamma-1,\gamma)$, with $\gamma\geq 2$. Our method only depends on the parameter relations and applies to more general classes of amply regular graphs. In particular, we develop a new combinatorial method for showing the existence of local perfect matchings. A key observation is that counting common neighbors leads to useful quadratic polynomials. Our result also leads to an interesting number theoretic consequence on quadratic residues.</description>
