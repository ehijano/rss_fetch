      <title>Pattern Formation of Freezing Infiltration in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity-driven infiltration of liquid water into unsaturated porous media can be a spatially heterogeneous process due to the gravity fingering instability. When such infiltration occurs in a subfreezing porous medium, liquid water can readily freeze, leading to both the removal of liquid water available for transport and a reduction in local permeability. As a result of the coupling between gravity fingering and freezing, macroscopic frozen structures can form that record the shape and history of the wetting front. These structures have been observed in the field in terrestrial snowpack and glacial firn layers and are believed to have profound impacts on how liquid water and its accompanying thermal content distribute during infiltration. However, a more detailed physics-based understanding of freezing infiltration has been missing. In this work, we use a thermodynamic nonequilibrium infiltration model to investigate the emergence of refrozen structures during water infiltration into an initially homogeneous and subfreezing porous medium. From scaling analysis, we recover the relevant nondimensional groups that govern the physics of the freezing infiltration process. We identify two key mechanisms caused by freezing that reduce the effective infiltration rate, calculated as the maximum depth of infiltration per elapsed time. In the first mechanism, the effective infiltrate rate decreases because a portion of the liquid water is consumed due to freezing, and such effect can be well quantified by the freezing Damk\"ohler number. For the second mechanism, we report on a new phenomenon termed secondary fingering, where new flow paths are established in between the primary infiltration channels. We find that secondary fingering reduces the degree of flow channelization and thus weakens the effective rate of infiltration via flow field homogenization.</description>

      <title>A phase-field model for wet snow metamorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructure of snow determines its fundamental properties such as the mechanical strength, reflectivity, or the thermo-hydraulic properties. Snow undergoes continuous microstructural changes due to local gradients in temperature, humidity or curvature, in a process known as snow metamorphism. In this work, we focus on wet snow metamorphism, which occurs when temperature is close to the melting point and involves phase transitions amongst liquid water, water vapor, and solid ice. We propose a pore-scale phase-field model that simultaneously captures the three relevant phase-change phenomena: sublimation (deposition), evaporation (condensation), and melting (solidification). The phase-field formulation allows one to track the temperature evolution amongst the three phases and the water vapor concentration in the air. Our three-phase model recovers the corresponding two-phase transition model when one phase is not present in the system. 2D simulations of the model unveils the impact of humidity and temperature on the dynamics of wet snow metamorphism at the pore scale. We also explore the role of liquid melt content in controlling the dynamics of snow metamorphism in contrast to the dry regime, before percolation onsets. The model can be readily extended to incorporate two-phase flow and may be the basis for investigating other problems involving water phase transitions in a vapor-solid-liquid system such as airplane icing or thermal spray coating.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent reinforcement learning for the control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has found application in numerous use-cases pertaining to flow control. Multi-agent RL (MARL), a variant of DRL, has shown to be more effective than single-agent RL in controlling flows exhibiting locality and translational invariance. We present, for the first time, an implementation of MARL-based control of three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC). Control is executed by modifying the temperature distribution along the bottom wall divided into multiple control segments, each of which acts as an independent agent. Two regimes of RBC are considered at Rayleigh numbers $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$. Evaluation of the learned control policy reveals a reduction in convection intensity by $23.5\%$ and $8.7\%$ at $\mathrm{Ra}=500$ and $750$, respectively. The MARL controller converts irregularly shaped convective patterns to regular straight rolls with lower convection that resemble flow in a relatively more stable regime. We draw comparisons with proportional control at both $\mathrm{Ra}$ and show that MARL is able to outperform the proportional controller. The learned control strategy is complex, featuring different non-linear segment-wise actuator delays and actuation magnitudes. We also perform successful evaluations on a larger domain than used for training, demonstrating that the invariant property of MARL allows direct transfer of the learnt policy.</description>

      <title>Transition reversal over a blunt plate at Mach 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the stability and transition to turbulence over an experimental blunt flat plate with different leading-edge radii are investigated. The freestream Mach number is 5, the unit Reynolds number is $6\times10^7$ m$^{-1}$, and the maximum nose-tip radius 3 mm exceeds the experimental reversal value. High-resolution numerical simulation and stability analysis are performed. Three-dimensional broadband perturbation is added on the farfield boundary to initiate the transition. The highlight of this work is that the complete physical process is considered, including the three-dimensional receptivity, linear and nonlinear instabilities, and transition. The experimental reversal phenomenon is favourably reproduced in the numerical simulation for the first time. Linear stability analysis shows that unstable first and second modes are absent in the blunt-plate flows owing to the presence of the entropy layer, although these modes are evident in the sharp-leading-edge case. Therefore, the transition on the blunt plate is due to nonmodal instabilities. Numerical results for all the blunt-plate cases reveal the formation of streamwise streaky structures downstream of the nose (stage I) and then the presence of intermittent turbulent spots in the transitional region (stage II). In stage I, a preferential spanwise wavelength of around 0.9 mm is selected for all the nose-tip radii, and low-frequency components are dominant. In stage II, high-frequency secondary instabilities appear to grow, which participate in the eventual breakdown. By contrast, leading-edge streaks are not remarkable in the sharp-leading-edge case, where transition is induced by oblique first and Mack second modes. The transition reversal beyond the critical nose-tip radius arises from an increasing magnitude of the streaky response in the early stage, while the transition mechanism keeps similar qualitatively.</description>

      <title>NeuroSEM: A hybrid framework for simulating multiphysics problems by coupling PINNs and spectral elements</title>

Abstract: Multiphysics problems that are characterized by complex interactions among fluid dynamics, heat transfer, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics, are inherently challenging due to their coupled nature. While experimental data on certain state variables may be available, integrating these data with numerical solvers remains a significant challenge. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising results in various engineering disciplines, particularly in handling noisy data and solving inverse problems. However, their effectiveness in forecasting nonlinear phenomena in multiphysics regimes is yet to be fully established. This study introduces NeuroSEM, a hybrid framework integrating PINNs with the high-fidelity Spectral Element Method (SEM) solver, Nektar++. NeuroSEM leverages strengths of both PINNs and SEM, providing robust solutions for multiphysics problems. PINNs are trained to assimilate data and model physical phenomena in specific subdomains, which are then integrated into Nektar++. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of NeuroSEM for thermal convection in cavity flow and flow past a cylinder. The framework effectively handles data assimilation by addressing those subdomains and state variables where data are available. We applied NeuroSEM to the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system, including cases with missing thermal boundary conditions. Our results indicate that NeuroSEM accurately models the physical phenomena and assimilates the data within the specified subdomains. The framework's plug-and-play nature facilitates its extension to other multiphysics or multiscale problems. Furthermore, NeuroSEM is optimized for an efficient execution on emerging integrated GPU-CPU architectures. This hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex engineering challenges in various scientific domains.</description>

      <title>MetaOpenFOAM: an LLM-based multi-agent framework for CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as a complex problem, presents unique challenges in automated simulations that require sophisticated solutions. MetaOpenFOAM, as a novel multi-agent collaborations framework, aims to complete CFD simulation tasks with only natural language as input. These simulation tasks include mesh pre-processing, simulation and post-processing, etc. MetaOpenFOAM harnesses the power of MetaGPT's assembly line paradigm, which assigns diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex CFD tasks into manageable subtasks. Langchain further complements MetaOpenFOAM by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which enhances the framework's ability by integrating a searchable database of OpenFOAM tutorials for LLMs. Tests on a benchmark for natural language-based CFD solver, consisting of 8 CFD simulation tasks, have shown that MetaOpenFOAM achieved a high pass rate per test (85%), with each test case costing only $0.22 on average. The 8 CFD simulation tasks include compressible and incompressible flows, 2D and 3D flows, heat transfer, and combustion, demonstrating the ability to automate CFD simulations using only natural language input and iteratively correct errors to achieve the desired simulation at a low cost. An ablation study was conducted to verify the necessity of each component in the multi-agent system and the RAG technology. A sensitivity study on the randomness of LLM showed that LLM with low randomness can obtain more stable and accurate results. Additionally, MetaOpenFOAM own the ability to identify and modify key parameters in user requirements and excels in correcting bugs when failures occur, with or without human participation, which demonstrates the generalization of MetaOpenFOAM.</description>

      <title>Higher order quantum reservoir computing for non-intrusive reduced-order models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting dynamical systems is of importance to numerous real-world applications. When possible, dynamical systems forecasts are constructed based on first-principles-based models such as through the use of differential equations. When these equations are unknown, non-intrusive techniques must be utilized to build predictive models from data alone. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently been used for such tasks. Moreover, ML methods provide the added advantage of significant reductions in time-to-solution for predictions in contrast with first-principle based models. However, many state-of-the-art ML-based methods for forecasting rely on neural networks, which may be expensive to train and necessitate requirements for large amounts of memory. In this work, we propose a quantum mechanics inspired ML modeling strategy for learning nonlinear dynamical systems that provides data-driven forecasts for complex dynamical systems with reduced training time and memory costs. This approach, denoted the quantum reservoir computing technique (QRC), is a hybrid quantum-classical framework employing an ensemble of interconnected small quantum systems via classical linear feedback connections. By mapping the dynamical state to a suitable quantum representation amenable to unitary operations, QRC is able to predict complex nonlinear dynamical systems in a stable and accurate manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through benchmark forecasts of the NOAA Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature dataset and compare the performance of QRC to other ML methods.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and physical validity in modeling turbomachinery PIV data by Physics-Informed CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data is a valuable asset in fluid mechanics. It is capable of visualizing flow structures even in complex physics scenarios, such as the flow at the exit of the rotor of a centrifugal fan. Machine learning is also a successful companion to PIV in order to increase data resolution or impute experimental gaps. While classical algorithms focus solely on replicating data using statistical metrics, the application of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) contributes to both data reconstruction and adherence to governing equations. The present study utilizes a convolutional physics-informed auto-encoder to reproduce planar PIV fields in the gappy regions while also satisfying the mass conservation equation. It proposes a novel approach, which compromises experimental data reconstruction for compliance with physical restrictions. Simultaneously, it is aimed to ensure that the reconstruction error does not considerably deviate from the uncertainty band of the test data. Turbulence scale approximation is employed to set the relative weighting of the physical and non-physical terms in the loss function to ensure that both objectives are achieved. All steps are initially evaluated on a set of DNS data to demonstrate the general capability of the network. Finally, examination of the PIV data indicates that the proposed PINN auto-encoder can enhance reconstruction accuracy by about 28% and 29% in terms of mass conservation residual and velocity statistics, respectively, in expense of up to 5% increase in the number of vectors with reconstruction error higher than the uncertainty band of the PIV test data.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic approach to reproduce multiple spinning vortices in horizontally rotating three-dimensional liquid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a rotating liquid helium-4, using a two-fluid model with spin-angular momentum conservation. Our model was derived from the particle approximation of an inviscid fluid with residual viscosity. Despite the fully classical mechanical picture, the resulting system equations were consistent with those of the conventional two-fluid model. We consider bulk liquid helium-4 to be an inviscid fluid, assuming that the viscous fluid component remains at finite temperatures. As the temperature decreased, the amount of the viscous fluid component decreased, ultimately becoming a fully inviscid fluid at absolute zero. Weak compressibility is assumed to express the volume change because some helium atoms do not render fluid owing to BECs or change states because of local thermal excitation. One can solve the governing equations for an incompressible fluid using explicit SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), simultaneously reproducing density fluctuations and describing the fluid in a many-particle system. We assume the following fluid-particle duality: a hydrodynamic interfacial tension between the inviscid and viscous components or a local interaction force between two types of fluid particles. The former can be induced in the horizontal direction when non-negligible non-uniformity of the particles occurs during forced two-dimensional rotation, and the latter is non-negligible when the former is negligible. We performed a largescale simulation of 3D liquid helium forced to rotate horizontally using 32 GPUs. Compared with the low-resolution calculation using 2.4 million particles, the high-resolution calculation using 19.6 million particles showed spinning vortices close to those of the theoretical solution. We obtained a promising venue to establish a practical simulation method for bulk liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of Microcavity Filling Regimes for Lab-on-a-Chip Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient and voidless filling of microcavities is of great importance for Lab-on-a-Chip applications. However, predicting whether microcavities will be filled or not under different circumstances is still difficult due to the local flow effects dominated by surface tension. In this work, a close-up study of the microcavity filling process is presented, shedding light on the mechanisms of the filling process using experimental insights accompanied by 3D numerical simulations. The movement of a fluid interface over a microcavity array is investigated optically under consideration of different fluids, capillary numbers, and cavity depths, revealing a regime map of different filling states. Moreover, the transient interface progression over the cavities is analyzed with attention to small-scale effects such as pinning. Besides the visual analysis of the image series, quantitative data of the dynamic contact angle and the interface progression is derived using an automated evaluation workflow. In addition to the experiments, 3D Volume-of-Fluid simulations are employed to further investigate the interface shape. It is shown that the simulations can not only predict the filling states in most cases, but also the transient movement and shape of the interface. The data and code associated with this work are publicly available at Bosch Research GitHub and at the TUDatalib data repository.</description>

      <title>SWRC Fit and unsatfit for parameter determination of unsaturated soil properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SWRC Fit and unsatfit are programs developed for determining parameters of the water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions of soils for analyzing water movement in the unsaturated soil. The SWRC Fit is a web application for drawing SWRC (soil water retention curves) of various soil hydraulic models from the measured data with just one click, available at https://purl.org/net/swrc/. The SWRC Fit depends on the Python library unsatfit that implements various types of soil hydraulic models to determine water retention and hydraulic conductivity parameters by nonlinear least-square optimization. The implemented models are classified as DF3 (Brooks and Corey, van Genuchten, Kosugi) models, DF4 (Fredlund, Fayer, Peters, bimodal-CH) models, and DF5 (bimodal) models by the degree of freedom of the water retention functions. Most of the hydraulic conductivity functions are derived from the water retention function and the general hydraulic conductivity function. A modified model to suppress extreme changes in hydraulic conductivity in the near-saturated range can be applied to any hydraulic model. The algorithm that was proved to work with various types of soils in Seki et al. (2023) is provided as the sample Python codes. This paper describes how to use SWRC Fit and unsatfit.</description>

      <title>A Lattice Boltzmann Method for Non-Newtonian Blood Flow in Coiled Intracranial Aneurysms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms are the leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke. One of the established treatment approaches is the embolization induced by coil insertion. However, the prediction of treatment and subsequent changed flow characteristics in the aneurysm is still an open problem. In this work, we present an approach based on a patient-specific geometry and parameters including a coil representation as inhomogeneous porous medium. The model consists of the volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for a non-Newtonian blood rheology. We solve these equations using a problem-adapted lattice Boltzmann method and present a comparison between fully-resolved and volume-averaged simulations. The results indicate the validity of the model. Overall, this workflow allows for patient specific assessment of the flow due to potential treatment.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>
