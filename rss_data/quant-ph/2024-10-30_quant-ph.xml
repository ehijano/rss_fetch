      <title>Mapping of a many-qubit state onto an oscillator using controlled displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the controlled displacement interaction between a qubit and a harmonic oscillator to the multi-qubit (qudit) case. We define discrete quadratures of the qudit and show how the qudit state can be displaced in these quadratures controlled by an oscillator quadrature. Using this interaction, a periodic repetition of the state encoded in the qudit, can be deterministically mapped onto the oscillator, which is initialized in a squeezed state. Based on this controlled displacement interaction, we present a full circuit that encodes quantum information in a superposition of qudit quadrature states, and successively prepares the oscillator in the corresponding superposition of approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states. This preparation scheme is found to be similar to phase estimation, with the addition of a disentanglement gate. Our protocol for GKP state preparation is efficient in the sense, that the set of qubits need only interact with the oscillator through two time-independent interactions, and in the sense that the squeeze factor (in dB) of the produced GKP state grows linearly in the number of qubits used.</description>

      <title>Zero-point energy of tensor fluctuations on the MPS manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a method for studying low-energy physics in highly correlated magnetic systems using the matrix product state (MPS) manifold. We adapt the spin-wave approach, which has been very successful in modeling certain low-entanglement magnetic materials, to systems where the ground state is better represented by an MPS, such as the S = 1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model. We argue that the quasi-local action of tensor fluctuations and the natural K\"ahler structure of the MPS manifold facilitate a description in terms of bosonic modes. We apply this approach to compute fluctuation corrections to the bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model, whose ground state we expect to be close to the exact bond dimension 2 AKLT state in a certain parameter range. Our results show significant improvements in energy approximations, highlighting both the qualitative and quantitative potential of this paradigm for studying complex entangled systems. This approach paves the way for new insights into the low-energy physics of correlated materials and the development of effective field theories beyond traditional semiclassical methods.</description>

      <title>Improving absolute separability bounds for arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sufficient analytical conditions for separability in composite quantum systems are very scarce and only known for low-dimensional cases. Here, we use linear maps and their inverses to derive powerful analytical conditions, providing tight bounds and extremal points of the set of absolutely separable states, i.e., states that remain separable under any global unitary transformation. Our analytical results apply to generic quantum states in arbitrary dimensions, and depend only on a single or very few eigenvalues of the considered state. Furthermore, we use convex geometry tools to improve the general characterization of the AS set given several non-comparable criteria. Finally, we present various conditions related to the twin problem of characterizing absolute PPT, that is, the set of quantum states that are positive under partial transposition and remain so under all unitary transformations.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as an emitter. Time-modulating driving stimulates the emitter to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to that of other generation methods for propagating states, which suggests a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\text{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha&lt;\alpha_\text{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\text{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation in sympathetic cooling of diatomic molecular ions by laser-cooled atomic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sympathetic cooling of molecular ions through the Coulomb interaction with laser-cooled atomic ions is an efficient tool to prepare translationally cold molecules. Even at relatively high collisional energies of about 1eV (T$\sim$10000K), the nearest approach in the ion-ion collisions never gets closer than $\sim$1nm such that naively perturbations of the internal molecular state are not expected. The Coulomb field may, however, induce rotational transitions changing the purity of initially quantum state prepared molecules. Here, we use estimates of rotational state changes in collisions of diatomic ions with atomic ions (arXiv:1905.02130) and determine the overall rotational excitation accumulated over the sympathetic cooling. We also estimate the cooling time, considering both a single atomic ion and a Coulomb crystal of atomic ions.</description>

      <title>Metalens formed by structured arrays of atomic emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of atomic emitters have proven to be a promising platform to manipulate and engineer optical properties, due to their efficient cooperative response to near-resonant light. Here, we theoretically investigate their use as an efficient metalens. We show that, by spatially tailoring the (sub-wavelength) lattice constants of three consecutive two-dimensional arrays of identical atomic emitters, one can realize a large transmission coefficient with arbitrary position-dependent phase shift, whose robustness against losses is enhanced by the collective response. To characterize the efficiency of this atomic metalens, we perform large-scale numerical simulations involving a substantial number of atoms ($N\sim 5\times 10^5$) that is considerably larger than comparable works. Our results suggest that low-loss, robust optical devices with complex functionalities, ranging from metasurfaces to computer-generated holograms, could be potentially assembled from properly engineered arrays of atomic emitters.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum implementation of non-unitary operations with biorthogonal representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the contemporary advances in quantum implementation of non-unitary operations, we propose a new dilation method based on the biorthogonal representation of the non-unitary operator, mapping it to an isomorphic unitary matrix in the orthonormal computational basis. The proposed method excels in implementing non-unitary operators whose eigenvalues have absolute values exceeding one, when compared to other dilation and decomposition techniques. Unlike the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) method, which becomes less efficient as the number of unitary summands grows, the proposed technique is optimal for small-dimensional non-unitary operators regardless of the number of unitary summands. Thus, it can complement the LCU method for implementing general non-unitary operators arising in positive only open quantum systems and pseudo-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical correlations in four-wave mixing from cold ensembles of two-level atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in four-wave-mixing from ensembles of cold two-level atoms may prevail without filtering over background light with well-known classical interpretations, such as Rayleigh scattering, as recently experimentally demonstrated in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 128}, 083601 (2022)]. Here we provide an extended investigation of this effect, in which we detail the experimental procedure and the variation of the quantum correlation with various parameters of the system. Particularly, we show that the decay rate of the quantum correlations changes with the number of atoms in the sample, providing another indication of its superradiant nature. The non-classical aspects of the signal occur for short timescales, but the long timescales carry as well a lot of information on the classical correlations of the system. This slow classical regime presents also two clearly distinct time scales, which we explain by two different pathways for the creation of biphotons. From the global analysis of the data in all its timescales, we are able to derive an empirical expression to fit the data, resulting in information on, among other parameters, the sample's temperature and superradiant acceleration. In general, the reported quantum correlations present a dependence on critical parameters of the system, such as optical depth and excitation power, that is quite different from other systems used for biphoton generation, and are more robust to changes in these parameters. This opens the possibility of exploring this process for efficient generation of narrowband biphotons or of other quantum-correlated photonic states of higher order.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal control of superconducting qubits based on machine-learning characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing fast and high-fidelity quantum operations using open-loop quantum optimal control relies on having an accurate model of the quantum dynamics. Any deviations between this model and the complete dynamics of the device, such as the presence of spurious modes or pulse distortions, can degrade the performance of optimal controls in practice. Here, we propose an experimentally simple approach to realize optimal quantum controls tailored to the device parameters and environment while specifically characterizing this quantum system. Concretely, we use physics-inspired machine learning to infer an accurate model of the dynamics from experimentally available data and then optimize our experimental controls on this trained model. We show the power and feasibility of this approach by optimizing arbitrary single-qubit operations on a superconducting transmon qubit, using detailed numerical simulations. We demonstrate that this framework produces an accurate description of the device dynamics under arbitrary controls, together with the precise pulses achieving arbitrary single-qubit gates with a high fidelity of about 99.99%.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable atom transport by optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable single atoms have drawn significant attention for their potentials as flying quantum memory in non-local, dynamic quantum computing architectures. However, when dynamic optical tweezers are employed to control atoms opto-mechanically, conventional methods such as adiabatic controls and constant jerk controls are either inherently slow or induce mechanical heating, leading to atom loss over long distances or at high speeds. To address these challenges, we explore the method known as shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) as an efficient alternative for fast and reliable atom transport control. We present a series of proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that STA-based optical tweezer trajectories can achieve both rapid and reliable single-atom transport. These experiments include moving atoms between two locations, adjusting speeds en route, and navigating curved trajectories. Our results indicate that atoms can be transported with a constant acceleration on average over distances that is only limited by trap lifetime, while effectively suppressing vibrational heating. This makes STA methods particularly well-suited for long-distance atom transport, potentially spanning distances over centimeter scales, such as between quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Unique multipartite extension of quantum states over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum state over time formalism provides an extension of the density operator formalism into the time domain, so that quantum correlations across both space and time may be treated with a common mathematical formalism. While bipartite quantum states over time have been uniquely characterized from various perspectives, it is not immediately clear how to extend the uniqueness result to multipartite temporal scenarios, such as those considered in the context of Legget-Garg inequalities. In this Letter, we show that two simple assumptions uniquely single out a multipartite extension of bipartite quantum states over time, namely, linearity in the initial state and a quantum analog of conditionability for multipartite probability distributions. As a direct consequence of our uniqueness result we arrive at a canonical multipartite extension of Kirkwood-Dirac type quasi-probability distributions, and we conclude by showing how our result yields a new characterization of quantum Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of correlated biphotons through transparent samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon states generated through degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) can exhibit sharp correlations in the transverse spatial coordinates. This effect, associated with the separability of the biphoton wavefunction into functions of the centroid and the difference coordinates, leads to unique free space propagation features. Here, we show that if a phase object is placed in the image plane of the source, only the propagation of the function of the centroid coordinates is altered. This propagation can be experimentally reconstructed in coincidence imaging and via post-selection on spatially correlated events, which will reveal the diffraction pattern from the object with a phase enhancement due to the probes' two-photon nature. Our findings offer applications for non-interferometric, quantum-enhanced phase imaging.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced real-time sensing of protein binding process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing biokinetic processes play significant role in understanding fundamental cellular functions. Many physics based technologies used to study such processes are limited by the shot noise inherent to the coherent states of light. These technologies can greatly advantage by leveraging quantum probes to improve the sensitivity of measurements in cellular biology. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique has been used effectively to achieve label-free, real-time measurements of protein binding kinetics that constitutes an important biological phenomenon occurring near the cell membrane. Here, we demonstrate the integration of this technique with the two-mode bright squeezed state having fewer fluctuations as compared to the coherent state to improve the sensitivity of measurement in studying a protein binding process. We show 4dB of squeezing as we record the signal-to-noise ratio as the function of time and is maintained throughout the binding process. The quantum advantage as shown in terms of squeezing is achieved despite the total absorption of 74% from the source until the final detection after the sensor. Overall we provide the most practical setup for improving the sensitivity of the time-dependent measurements involved in various biological processes at the molecular level.</description>

      <title>Exact renormalization group flow for matrix product density operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix product density operator (MPDO) provides an efficient tensor network representation of mixed states on one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We study a real-space renormalization group transformation of MPDOs represented by a circuit of local quantum channels. We require that the renormalization group flow is exact, in the sense that it exactly preserves the correlation between the coarse-grained sites and is therefore invertible by another circuit of local quantum channels. Unlike matrix product states (MPS), which always have a well-defined isometric renormalization transformation, we show that general MPDOs do not necessarily admit a converging exact renormalization group flow. We then introduce a subclass of MPDOs with a well-defined renormalization group flow, and show the structure of the MPDOs in the subclass as a representation of a pre-bialgebra structure. As a result, such MPDOs obey generalized symmetry represented by matrix product operator algebras associated with the pre-bialgebra. We also discuss implications with the classification of mixed-state quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Discrete Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTC) exhibit a special non-equilibrium phase of matter in periodically driven many-body systems with spontaneous breaking of time translational symmetry. The presence of decoherence generally enhances thermalization and destroys the coherence required for the existence of DTC. In this letter, we devise a mechanism for establishing a stable DTC with period-doubling oscillations in an open quantum system that is governed by a properly tailored non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We find a specific class of non-reciprocal couplings in our non-Hermitian dynamics which prevents thermalization through eigenstate ordering. Such choice of non-Hermitian dynamics, significantly enhances the stability of the DTC against imperfect pulses. Through a comprehensive analysis, we determine the phase diagram of the system in terms of pulse imperfection.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Detection Using a Two-Qubit System Under Noisy Heisenberg Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to design a magnetic field detector using a noisy two-qubit system. The system evolves under a noisy Heisenberg interaction Hamiltonian, and we investigate its behavior by calculating both the $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence and the return probability in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. We allow for decoherence modeled by quasi-static charge noise in the exchange coupling of the two-qubit system and find that, while the magnetic field does not significantly influence the decoherence process, it introduces a distinct oscillation in the return probability over time. Importantly, the oscillation frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field, providing a clear signature that can be used for magnetic field detection. These results point towards the feasibility of realizing a practical quantum-based magnetic field detector, with the ability to operate under noisy conditions while maintaining sensitivity to the field strength.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy Quantum Many-Body Scar under Emergent Chiral Symmetry and Pseudo Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) is a mechanism for generating quantum many-body scar (QMBS), which provides a route to weakly break ergodicity. The zero-energy QMBSs widely exist across various systems due to the intertwining of chiral symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry. In this work, we study the phenomenology of the zero-energy QMBS under the interplay between the chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF, where the Hilbert space is approximately fragmented into different blocks. We consider a model of tilted chain of interacting spinless fermions with periodically varying tunneling strength. At small tunneling strength and under resonance condition, the system is described by an effective model with chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF. We find that the interplay between the two gives rise to a highly localized zero-energy QMBS when the particle number is even. We identify a simple product state to signalize the zero-energy QMBS, which gives rise to unusual scarred dynamics. The fidelity oscillates around a fixed value without decaying instead of showing the usual collapse and revival in common scarred systems. We show that the signature of the zero-energy QMBS can also be captured by the original Hamiltonian. Our results uncover a new scar phenomenon and provide an example that does not need the intertwining of chiral and spatial symmetries to support zero-energy QMBS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the x-ray constrained wavefunction fitting approach, a key method in quantum crystallography for charge density reconstruction, to incorporate experimental observables beyond x-ray diffraction. Unlike traditional quantum crystallography methods, which are typically limited to molecules in their ground states, our approach integrates excited states. This advancement will enable simultaneous fitting of x-ray diffraction data alongside optical and x-ray spectroscopic data. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for the inclusion of any experimental observable as a constraint in wavefunction reconstruction. Furthermore, we provide detailed derivations and instructions for implementation of this method using two electronicstructure methods: a generalized Hartree-Fock method for excited states and the Coupled Cluster Equation-of-motion method.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Quantum Algorithms for Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Comparative Study of non-FTQC Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically benchmarks several non-fault-tolerant quantum computing algorithms across four distinct optimization problems: max-cut, number partitioning, knapsack, and quantum spin glass. Our benchmark includes noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, such as the variational quantum eigensolver, quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum imaginary time evolution, and imaginary time quantum annealing, with both ansatz-based and ansatz-free implementations, alongside tensor network methods and direct simulations of the imaginary-time Schr\"odinger equation. For comparative analysis, we also utilize classical simulated annealing and quantum annealing on D-Wave devices. Employing default configurations, our findings reveal that no single non-FTQC algorithm performs optimally across all problem types, underscoring the need for tailored algorithmic strategies. This work provides an objective performance baseline and serves as a critical reference point for advancing NISQ algorithms and quantum annealing platforms.</description>

Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a new theoretical approach to interpreting and reproducing quantum mechanics using trajectory-guided wavelets. Inspired by the 1925 work of Louis de Broglie, we demonstrate that pulses composed of a difference between a retarded wave and an advanced wave (known as antisymmetric waves) are capable of following quantum trajectories predicted by de Broglie-Bohm theory (also known as Bohmian mechanics). Our theory reproduces the main results of orthodox quantum mechanics and, unlike Bohmian theory, is local in the Bell sense. We show that this is linked to the superdeterminism and past-future (anti)symmetry of our theory.</description>

      <title>LEGO_HQEC: A Software Tool for Analyzing Holographic Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial prerequisite for future large-scale quantum computation. Finding and analyzing new QEC codes, along with efficient decoding and fault-tolerance protocols, is central to this effort. Holographic codes are a recent class of QEC subsystem codes derived from holographic bulk/boundary dualities. In addition to exploring the physics of such dualities, these codes possess useful QEC properties such as tunable encoding rates, distance scaling competitive with topological codes, and excellent recovery thresholds. To allow for a comprehensive analysis of holographic code constructions, we introduce LEGO_HQEC, a software package utilizing the quantum LEGO formalism. This package constructs holographic codes on regular hyperbolic tilings and generates their stabilizer generators and logical operators for a specified number of seed codes and layers. Three decoders are included: an erasure decoder based on Gaussian elimination; an integer-optimization decoder; and a tensor-network decoder. With these tools, LEGO_HQEC thus enables future systematic studies regarding the utility of holographic codes for practical quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum anomalous heat flow using mid-circuit measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gate-based quantum computers are an innovative tool for experimentally studying the core principles of quantum mechanics. This work presents the first observation of quantum anomalous heat flow between two qubits and investigates the role of mid-circuit measurements in this context. Using mid-circuit measurements, we designed quantum circuits that violate the semi-classical heat flow bound, witnessing negativities in the underlying Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability distribution, which indicates the presence of quantum correlations between the subsystems. Mid-circuit measurements, crucial for probing qubits during the experiment, enabled these observations but also introduced disturbances, such as energy leakage, leading to deviations from theoretical predictions. We modeled these noise effects, providing insight into the limitations of current mid-circuit measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Robust Micro-Macro Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite entangled states between a qubit and macroscopically distinct states of a mesoscopic system, known as micro-macro entangled states, are emerging resources for quantum information processing. One main challenge in generating such states in the lab is their fragility to environmental noise. We analyze this fragility in detail for single particle noise by identifying what factors play a role in the robustness and quantifying their effect. There is a trade-off between the macroscopicity of a micro-macro entangled state and the robustness of its bipartite entanglement to environmental noise. We identify symmetric micro-macro entangled states as the most robust states to single particle noise. We show that the robustness of bipartite entanglement of such states to single particle noise decreases as the second order of macroscopicity, which identifies a regime where the bipartite entangled state is both robust and macroscopic. Our result is a step towards retaining quantum characteristics on large scales and experimental realization of micro-macro entangled spin states and their use for connecting separated qubits. Moreover, it advances our understanding of quantum to classical transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A driven linear oscillator and a feedback mechanism are two necessary elements of any classical periodic clock. Here, we introduce a novel, fully quantum clock using a driven oscillator in the quantum regime and coherent quantum feedback. We show that if we treat the model semiclassically, this system supports limit cycles, or self-sustained oscillations, as needed for a periodic clock. We then analyse the noise of the system quantum mechanically and prove that the accuracy of this clock is higher compared to the clock implemented with the classical measurement feedback. We experimentally implement the model using two superconducting cavities with incorporated Josephson junctions and microwave circulators for the realisation of the quantum feedback. We confirm the appearance of the limit cycle and study the clock accuracy both in frequency and time domains. Under specific conditions of noisy driving, we observe that the clock oscillations are more coherent than the drive, pointing towards the implementation of a quantum autonomous clock.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) using a quadratic zeroth-order Hamiltonian is a cornerstone of many \emph{ab initio} computational methods for molecules and materials. However, this perturbation expansion can break down in the presence of strong electron correlation, which occurs in many scenarios such as the bond dissociation of molecules in chemical reactions. In this work, we developed a generalized (time-dependent) MBPT for computing electron correlation energies, in which the zeroth-order Hamiltonian can be interacting and hence the zeroth-order reference state is a multi-determinant wavefunction instead of a single Slater determinant in general. This allows us to take strong correlation into account from the outset and treat the residual weak interaction by diagrammatic perturbation expansion. Using this framework, we formulated a multi-reference (MR) generalization of the standard single-reference (SR) random phase approximation (RPA) for the electron correlation energy by resumming generalized ring diagrams including cumulant contributions, which naturally leads to a set of unified equations that work in both SR and MR cases. To further include exchange effects, we also derived a multi-reference second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction from a coupled-cluster perspective of the resulting MR-RPA. Applications to prototypical molecules demonstrate that MR-RPA/SOSEX successfully resolves the well-known failure of the conventional SR-RPA/SOSEX for molecular dissociation. Our work bridges MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theory in quantum chemistry, opening up new possibilities for advancing computational methods for the electron correlation energy via diagrammatic resummation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce QuARC, Quantum Adaptive Routing using Clusters, a novel clustering-based entanglement routing protocol that leverages redundant, multi-path routing through multi-particle projective quantum measurements to enable high-throughput, low-overhead, starvation-free entanglement distribution. At its core, QuARC periodically reconfigures the underlying quantum network into clusters of different sizes, where each cluster acts as a small network that distributes entanglement across itself, and the end-to-end entanglement is established by further distributing between clusters. QuARC does not require a-priori knowledge of any physical parameters, and is able to adapt the network configuration using static topology information, and using local (within-cluster) measurements only. We present a comprehensive simulation-based evaluation that shows QuARC is robust against changes to physical network parameters, and maintains high throughput without starvation even as network sizes scale and physical parameters degrade.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Temperature Distributions for Training Neural Quantum States using Parallel Tempering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be very expressive ansatzes for variational algorithms, reaching state-of-the-art energies on many quantum many-body Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, the training of the ANN can be slow and stymied by the presence of local minima in the parameter landscape. One approach to mitigate this issue is to use parallel tempering methods, and in this work we focus on the role played by the temperature distribution of the parallel tempering replicas. Using an adaptive method that adjusts the temperatures in order to equate the exchange probability between neighboring replicas, we show that this temperature optimization can significantly increase the success rate of the variational algorithm with negligible computational cost by eliminating bottlenecks in the replicas' random walk. We demonstrate this using two different neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine and a feedforward network, which we use to study a toy problem based on a permutation invariant Hamiltonian with a pernicious local minimum and the J1-J2 model on a rectangular lattice.</description>

Abstract: Air-bridges play a critical role in the performance of microwave circuits integrated with superconducting quantum bits, and their mechanical stability is predominant for reliable operation. This study is devoted to the technological issues that lead to air-bridge instability. We propose an optimized bridge geometry designed to enhance mechanical resilience. Through systematic testing, we established that bridges incorporating this novel geometry achieved complete stability for lengths up to 170 micrometers in our technological processes. The findings provide an insight into the problem and a practical solution for technologists that faced with the challenges of air-bridge stability. The implementation of our technology has the potential to significantly improve the mechanical robustness of air-bridges in multi-qubit circuits for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Carleman linearisation efficiency in nonlinear fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a specialised branch of fluid mechanics that utilises numerical methods and algorithms to solve and analyze fluid-flow problems. One promising avenue to enhance CFD is the use of quantum computing, which has the potential to resolve nonlinear differential equations more efficiently than classical computers. Here, we try to answer the question of which regimes of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for fluid dynamics can have an efficient quantum algorithm. We propose a connection between the numerical parameter, $R$, that guarantees efficiency in the truncation of the Carleman linearisation, and the physical parameters that describe the fluid flow. This link can be made thanks to the Kolmogorov scale, which determines the minimum size of the grid needed to properly resolve the energy cascade induced by the nonlinear term. Additionally, we introduce the formalism for vector field simulation in different spatial dimensions, providing the discretisation of the operators and the boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time of the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we amend these issues by incorporating numerical methods that lift some of the previously applied approximations. Our results agree with the experimental measurements, also for devices with shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Towards Unconditional Uncloneable Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncloneable encryption is a cryptographic primitive which encrypts a classical message into a quantum ciphertext, such that two quantum adversaries are limited in their capacity of being able to simultaneously decrypt, given the key and quantum side-information produced from the ciphertext. Since its initial proposal and scheme in the random oracle model by Broadbent and Lord [TQC 2020], uncloneable encryption has developed into an important primitive at the foundation of quantum uncloneability for cryptographic primitives. Despite sustained efforts, however, the question of unconditional uncloneable encryption (and in particular of the simplest case, called an uncloneable bit) has remained elusive. Here, we propose a candidate for the unconditional uncloneable bit problem, and provide strong evidence that the adversary's success probability in the related security game converges quadratically as ${1}/{2}+{1}/{(2\sqrt{K})}$, where $K$ represents the number of keys and ${1}/{2}$ is trivially achievable. We prove this bound's validity for $K$ ranging from $2$ to $7$ and demonstrate the validity up to $K = 17$ using computations based on the NPA hierarchy. We furthemore provide compelling heuristic evidence towards the general case. In addition, we prove an asymptotic upper bound of ${5}/{8}$ and give a numerical upper bound of $\sim 0.5980$, which to our knowledge is the best-known value in the unconditional model.</description>

      <title>Model Order Reduction for Open Quantum Systems Based on Measurement-adapted Time-coarse Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction encompasses mathematical techniques aimed at reducing the complexity of mathematical models in simulations while retaining the essential characteristics and behaviors of the original model. This is particularly useful in the context of large-scale dynamical systems, which can be computationally expensive to analyze and simulate. Here, we present a model order reduction technique to reduce the time complexity of open quantum systems, grounded in the principle of measurement-adapted coarse-graining. This method, governed by a coarse-graining time scale $\tau$ and the spectral band center $\omega_0$, organizes corrections to the lowest-order model which aligns with the RWA Hamiltonian in certain limits, and rigorously justifies the resulting effective quantum master equation (EQME). The focus on calculating to a high degree of accuracy only what can be resolved by the measurement introduces a principled regularization procedure to address singularities and generates low-stiffness models suitable for efficient long-time integration. Furthermore, the availability of the analytical form of the EQME parameters significantly boosts the interpretive capabilities of the method. As a demonstration, we derive the fourth-order EQME for a challenging problem related to the dynamics of a superconducting qubit under high-power dispersive readout in the presence of a continuum of dissipative waveguide modes. This derivation shows that the lowest-order terms align with previous results, while higher-order corrections suggest new phenomena.</description>

      <title>When can classical neural networks represent quantum states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A naive classical representation of an n-qubit state requires specifying exponentially many amplitudes in the computational basis. Past works have demonstrated that classical neural networks can succinctly express these amplitudes for many physically relevant states, leading to computationally powerful representations known as neural quantum states. What underpins the efficacy of such representations? We show that conditional correlations present in the measurement distribution of quantum states control the performance of their neural representations. Such conditional correlations are basis dependent, arise due to measurement-induced entanglement, and reveal features not accessible through conventional few-body correlations often examined in studies of phases of matter. By combining theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate how the state's entanglement and sign structure, along with the choice of measurement basis, give rise to distinct patterns of short- or long-range conditional correlations. Our findings provide a rigorous framework for exploring the expressive power of neural quantum states.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Inductance and Jitter Dependence of the Intrinsic Photon Number Resolution in Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to resolve photon numbers is crucial in quantum information science and technology, driving the development of detectors with intrinsic photon-number resolving (PNR) capabilities. Although transition edge sensors represent the state-of-the-art in PNR performance, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer superior efficiency, speed, noise reduction, and timing precision. Directly inferring photon numbers, however, has only recently become feasible due to advances in readout technology. Despite this, photon-number discrimination remains constrained by the nanowire's electrical properties and readout jitter. In this work, we employ waveguide-integrated SNSPDs and time-resolved measurements to explore how the nanowire kinetic inductance and system jitter affect PNR capabilities. By analyzing the latency time of the photon detection, we can resolve changes in the rising edge of the detection pulse. We find that lower jitter as well as increased kinetic inductance enhances the pulse separation for different photon numbers and improves the PNR capability. Enhancing the kinetic inductance from 165 nH to 872 nH improves PNR quality by 12%, 31% and 23% over the first three photon numbers, though at the cost of reducing the detector's count rate from 165 Mcps to 19 Mcps. Our findings highlight the trade-off between PNR resolution and detector speed.</description>

      <title>Fragile non-Bloch spectrum and unconventional Green's function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-Hermitian systems, it is a counterintuitive feature of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) that the energy spectrum and eigenstates can be totally different under open or periodic boundary conditions, suggesting that non-Hermitian spectra can be extremely sensitive to non-local perturbations. Here, we show that a wide range of non-Hermitian models with NHSE can even be highly sensitive to local perturbation under open boundary conditions. The spectrum of these models is so fragile that it can be significantly modified by adding only exponentially small perturbations on boundaries. Intriguingly, we show that such fragile spectra are quantified by the Green's function exhibiting unconventional V-shape asymptotic behaviors. Accordingly, bi-directional exponential amplification can be observed. As an interesting consequence, we find a real-to-complex transition of the bulk spectrum induced by exponentially small boundary perturbations. Finally, we reveal a hierarchy of the asymptotic behaviors of non-Hermitian Green's functions, which restricts the frequency range for the presence of unconventional Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of frequency-bin-encoded microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distributed quantum computing network requires a quantum communication channel between spatially separated processing units. In superconducting circuits, such a channel can be implemented based on propagating microwave photons to encode and transfer quantum information between an emitter and a receiver. However, traveling microwave photons can be lost during the transmission, leading to the failure of information transfer. Heralding protocols can be used to detect such photon losses. In this work, we propose such a protocol and experimentally demonstrate a frequency-bin encoding method of microwave photonic modes using superconducting circuits. We deterministically encode the quantum information from a superconducting qubit by simultaneously emitting its information into two photonic modes at different frequencies, with a process fidelity of 90.4%. The frequency-bin-encoded photonic modes can be used, at the receiver processor, to detect the occurrence of photon loss. Our work thus provides a reliable method to implement high-fidelity quantum state transfer in a distributed quantum computing network, incorporating error detection to enhance performance and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk Attack Resilient RNS Quantum Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computers scale, the rise of multi-user and cloud-based quantum platforms can lead to new security challenges. Attacks within shared execution environments become increasingly feasible due to the crosstalk noise that, in combination with quantum computer's hardware specifications, can be exploited in form of crosstalk attack. Our work pursues crosstalk attack implementation in ion-trap quantum computers. We propose three novel quantum crosstalk attacks designed for ion trap qubits: (i) Alternate CNOT attack (ii) Superposition Alternate CNOT (SAC) attack (iii) Alternate Phase Change (APC) attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed attacks by conducting noise-based simulations on a commercial 20-qubit ion-trap quantum computer. The proposed attacks achieve an impressive reduction of up to 42.2% in output probability for Quantum Full Adders (QFA) having 6 to 9-qubit output. Finally, we investigate the possibility of mitigating crosstalk attacks by using Residue Number System (RNS) based Parallel Quantum Addition (PQA). We determine that PQA achieves higher attack resilience against crosstalk attacks in the form of 24.3% to 133.5% improvement in output probability against existing Non Parallel Quantum Addition (NPQA). Through our systematic methodology, we demonstrate how quantum properties such as superposition and phase transition can lead to crosstalk attacks and also how parallel quantum computing can help secure against these attacks.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

      <title>Computation with quantum Reed-Muller codes and their mapping onto 2D atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a fault tolerant construction for error correction and computation using two punctured quantum Reed-Muller (PQRM) codes. In particular, we consider the $[[127,1,15]]$ self-dual doubly-even code that has transversal Clifford gates (CNOT, H, S) and the triply-even $[[127,1,7]]$ code that has transversal T and CNOT gates. We show that code switching between these codes can be accomplished using Steane error correction. For fault-tolerant ancilla preparation we utilize the low-depth hypercube encoding circuit along with different code automorphism permutations in different ancilla blocks, while decoding is handled by the high-performance classical successive cancellation list decoder. In this way, every logical operation in this universal gate set is amenable to extended rectangle analysis. The CNOT exRec has a failure rate approaching $10^{-9}$ at $10^{-3}$ circuit-level depolarizing noise.
  Furthermore, we map the PQRM codes to a 2D layout suitable for implementation in arrays of trapped atoms and try to reduce the circuit depth of parallel atom movements in state preparation. The resulting protocol is strictly fault-tolerant for the $[[127,1,7]]$ code and practically fault-tolerant for the $[[127,1,15]]$ code. Moreover, each patch requires a permutation consisting of $7$ sub-hypercube swaps only. These are swaps of rectangular grids in our 2D hypercube layout and can be naturally created with acousto-optic deflectors (AODs).
  Lastly, we show for the family of $[[2^{2r},{2r\choose r},2^r]]$ QRM codes that the entire logical Clifford group can be achieved using only permutations, transversal gates, and fold-transversal gates.</description>

      <title>A superconducting on-chip microwave cavity for tunable hybrid systems with optically trapped Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges of quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically non-trivial, since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work towards a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We unfold detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results illuminate the required consideration aspects for a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system, and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Generalized Short Path Algorithms: Towards Super-Quadratic Speedup over Markov Chain Search for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze generalizations of algorithms based on the short-path framework first proposed by Hastings [Quantum 2, 78 (2018)], which has been extended and shown by Dalzell et al. [STOC '22] to achieve super-Grover speedups for certain binary optimization problems. We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov Chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max-Bisection, Max Independent Set, the Ising Model, and the Sherrington Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable from previous short path techniques. For random regular graphs of sufficiently high degree, our algorithm is super-quadratically faster than the best rigorously proven classical runtimes for regular graphs. Our results also shed light on the quantum nature of short path algorithms, by identifying a setting where our algorithm is super-quadratically faster than any polynomial time Gibbs sampler, unless NP = RP. We conclude the paper with a numerical analysis that guides the choice of parameters for short path algorithms and raises the possibility of super-quadratic speedups in settings that are currently beyond our theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from estimates of Gibbs-state expectation values. Various methods for achieving this task were proposed recently, both from a practical and theoretical point of view. On the one hand, some practical algorithms have been implemented and used to analyze experimental data but these algorithms often lack correctness guarantees or fail to scale to large systems. On the other hand, theoretical algorithms with provable asymptotic efficiency guarantees have been proposed, but they seem challenging to implement. Recently, a semidefinite family of Hamiltonian learning algorithms was proposed which was numerically demonstrated to scale well into the 100-qubit regime, but provided no provable accuracy guarantees. We build on this work in two ways, by extending it to provide certified a posteriori lower and upper bounds on the parameters to be learned, and by proving a priori convergence in the special case where the Hamiltonian is commuting.</description>

      <title>Theory of vibrational Stark effect for adsorbates and diatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays the vibrational Stark effect (VSE) of adsorbates at the electrochemical interfaces is generally investigated using the Lambert theory, in which the strong electric field across the interfaces can be treated as some kind of perturbation. Lambert found that the VSE arises mainly from the classical effect, and the quantum effect is negligible. This idea is accepted by almost all current first-principle calculations for this issue. Here we revisit this problem by addressing the fundamental question that to what extent the quantum effect is important for VSE, and if it is observable, then which physical quantity determines this effect. We use the Morse, Lennard-Jones and Dunham potentials as basic potentials to explore this problem using quantum perturbation theory. We define the relative difference between quantum and classical VSE slopes to define the quantum effect, $\eta$, and show that for CO, $\eta \sim $ 2 - 3\%, while for adsorbed hydrogen on Pt electrode, $\eta \sim$ 8 - 10\%, using the experimental data. We find that $\eta$ is determined by the anharmonic coefficient $\chi_e$. Without results we present a new understanding of the VSE as a function of electric field and potential in electrochemical experiments, showing that the nonlinear slope of VSE as a function of potential should arise from the nonlinear relation between electric field and potential across the interfaces, which may resolve the long-standing controversial in experiments.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Incoherent Noise: A Coherent Quantum Approach in Multi-Sensor Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel dark matter detection scheme by leveraging quantum coherence across a network of multiple quantum sensors. This method effectively eliminates incoherent background noise, thereby significantly enhancing detection sensitivity. This is achieved by performing a series of basis transformation operations, allowing the coherent signal to be expressed as a combination of sensor population measurements without introducing background noise. We present a comprehensive analytical analysis and complement it with practical numerical simulations. These demonstrations reveal that signal strength is enhanced by the square of the number of sensors, while noise, primarily due to operational infidelity rather than background fluctuations, increases only linearly with the number of sensors. Our approach paves the way for next-generation dark matter searches that optimally utilize an advanced network of sensors and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy is Elastic Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the elastic cross section, which is the primary observable for high energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in unit of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and non-kinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel ``area law'' for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical approach for combinatorial problems at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum computing has drawn significant interest within the field of high-energy physics. We explore the potential of quantum algorithms to resolve the combinatorial problems in particle physics experiments. As a concrete example, we consider top quark pair production in the fully hadronic channel at the Large Hadron Collider. We investigate the performance of various quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and a feedback-based algorithm (FALQON). We demonstrate that the efficiency for selecting the correct pairing is greatly improved by utilizing quantum algorithms over conventional kinematic methods. Furthermore, we observe that gate-based universal quantum algorithms perform on par with machine learning techniques and either surpass or match the effectiveness of quantum annealers. Our findings reveal that quantum algorithms not only provide a substantial increase in matching efficiency but also exhibit scalability and adaptability, making them suitable for a variety of high-energy physics applications. Moreover, quantum algorithms eliminate the extensive training processes needed by classical machine learning methods, enabling real-time adjustments based on individual event data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With physical quantum computers becoming increasingly accessible, research on their applications across various fields has advanced rapidly. In this paper, we present the first study of quantum cosmology conducted on physical quantum computers, employing a newly proposed Hybrid Quantum-Classical (HQC) algorithm rather than the commonly used Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Specifically, we solve a constrained Hamiltonian equation derived by quantizing the Friedmann equation in cosmology. To solve this constraint equation, H |psi&gt; = 0, where H is a Hamiltonian operator and |psi&gt; = |psi(theta)&gt; is the wave function of phase angle theta describing the cosmic quantum state, we iteratively use the quantum computer to compute the eigenvalues of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt;, while a classical computer manages the underlying probability density function within the Probabilistic Bisection Algorithm (PBA) to update theta until the solution of &lt;psi | H | psi&gt; = 0 is achieved to a desired accuracy. Executing our algorithm on IBM's quantum computers, we attain a high-precision solution for theta, achieving approximately 1 percent error.</description>

      <title>Informational analysis of the confinement of an electron in an asymmetric double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-unidimensional one-electron double quantum dot is studied within the framework of Shannon informational entropy. Its confinement potential, which is described by an asymmetric harmonic-gaussian function, consists of two wells separated by a potential barrier, and the asymmetry of the potential in respect to the center of the barrier is parameterized by $x_0$. In this work we employ Shannon informational entropy as a tool to investigate changes in the electronic confinement resulting from the modifications in the degree of asymmetry $x_0$. In particular, we notice that Shannon entropy turns out to be very sensitive to the change from the symmetric to the antisymmetric regime. Moreover, we show that Shannon entropy as a function of $x_0$ for an electronic excited state displays an irregular behavior whenever the state energy is in the vicinity of a local extreme (a maximum or a minimum); connected with this we observe an oscillatory behavior of the energy of the excited states as a function of $x_0$.</description>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the first on-chip frequency multiplexed readout of two co-integrated single-electron transistors without the need for bulky resonators. We characterize single electron dynamics in both single electron transistors at 4.2K before validating their simultaneous readout within 2.2{\mu}s, achieving a 99.9% fidelity with a 1MHz frequency spacing. This experimental demonstration paves the way towards resonator-free large-scale quantum-classical architectures that would be required for future universal and reprogrammable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.</description>

      <title>Force-current structure in Markovian open quantum systems and its applications: geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition and thermodynamic trade-off relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Divergence of thermalization rates driven by the competition between finite temperature and quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of an isolated quantum system is described by quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, while these two subjects are still not fully consistent with each other. This leaves a less-explored region where both quantum and thermal effects cannot be neglected, and the ultracold atom platform provides a suitable and versatile testbed to experimentally investigate these complex phenomena. Here we perform experiments based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices and observe a divergence of thermalization rates of quantum matters when the temperature approaches zero. By ramping an external parameter in the Hamiltonian, we observe the time delay between the internal relaxation and the external ramping. This provides us with a direct comparison of the thermalization rates of different quantum phases. We find that the quantum coherence and bosonic stimulation of superfluid induces the divergence while the finite temperature and the many-body interactions are suppressing the divergence. The quantum coherence and the thermal effects are competing with each other in this isolated thermal quantum system, which leads to the transition of thermalization rate from divergence to convergence.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs are essential sources for photonic quantum information processing. However, generating entangled photon pairs with large detuning via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) often requires complex configurations to compensate for phase matching. Here, we propose a simple and efficient scheme to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs based on type-0 SPDC in a thin-film lithium niobate waveguide with a single poling period. By utilizing the strong dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, we can achieve both degenerate and highly detuned entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate on-chip temporal compensation using an integrated waveguide structure. Our approach offers a compact and scalable solution for integrated quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Anderson Localization in Photonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of the wave equations for time-independent disordered media can exhibit Anderson localization where instead of wave propagation we observe their localization around different points in space. Photonic time crystals are spatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically in time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By analogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence of temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson localization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations of the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson localization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the temporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay exponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a fluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur, and the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of \emph{majorization} relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of bistochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove new exact finite-$n$ results in the case of \emph{UT-majorization} relation, i.e.,\ when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Differential High-Frequency Lock-In Probe for Laser-Induced Vacuum Birefringence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of laser-induced vacuum birefringence through the use of pulsed lasers coupled to femtosecond optical enhancement cavities. This measurement technique features cavity-enhanced pump and probe pulses, as well as an independent control pulse. The control pulse allows for a differential measurement where the final signal is obtained using high-frequency lock-in detection, greatly mitigating time-dependent cavity birefringence as an important and possibly prohibitive systematic effect. In addition, the method features the economical use of laser power, and results in a relatively simple experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Slow Relaxation in a Glassy Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits have become a powerful tool in the study of many-body quantum physics, providing insights into both fast-thermalizing chaotic and non-thermalizing integrable many-body dynamics. In this work, we explore a distinct intermediate class - glassy quantum systems - where thermalization occurs, but over very long timescales. We introduce and analyze a Floquet random quantum circuit that can be tuned between glassy and fully ergodic behavior through a single adjustable parameter. This circuit can be understood as the unitary analog of the block Rosenzweig-Porter model, which is defined by a Hamiltonian. Using an effective field theory for random quantum circuits, we analyze the correlations between quasienergy eigenstates and thereby determine the time evolution of the disorder-averaged density matrix. In the intermediate regime the circuit displays a two-step thermalization process: an initial relaxation within weakly coupled sectors followed by a later, global thermalization. We also show that the ramp of the spectral form factor is enhanced by a factor of the number of sectors in the glassy regime, and at early times in the intermediate regime. These results indicate that quantum circuits provide an ideal platform for the exploration of nontrivial thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems, offering deeper insights into quantum thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1407.6262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical proposals for two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocols based on Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that are strongly coupled to the target nuclei. Continuous microwave and radio-frequency driving fields together with magnetic field gradients achieve Hartmann-Hahn resonances between NV spin sensor and selected nuclei for control of nuclear spins and subsequent measurement of their polarization dynamics. The strong coupling between the NV sensor and the nuclei facilitates coherence control of nuclear spins and relaxes the requirement of nuclear spin polarization to achieve strong signals and therefore reduced measurement times. Additionally, we employ a singular value thresholding matrix completion algorithm to further reduce the amount of data required to permit the identification of key features in the spectra of strongly sub-sampled data. We illustrate the potential of this combined approach by applying the protocol to a shallowly implanted NV center addressing a small amino acid, alanine, to target specific hydrogen nuclei and to identify the corresponding peaks in their spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.02130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate rotational state changes in a single collision of diatomic molecular ions, both polar and apolar, with an atomic ion. These may occur when sympathetically cooling trapped molecular ions by co-trapped laser-cooled atomic ions, since the electric field due to the atom may excite molecular rotations. Thanks to the different time and energy scales of translational and rotational motion, we may treat the collision classically and describe rotations quantum mechanically. Based on numerical calculations for a number of examples, we derive closed-form estimates for the rotational excitation per collision, depending on the scattering energy and the molecular parameters.</description>

      <title>Photon-number moments and cumulants of Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06067v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop closed-form expressions for the moments and cumulants of Gaussian states when measured in the photon-number basis. We express the photon-number moments of a Gaussian state in terms of the loop Hafnian, a function that when applied to a $(0,1)$-matrix representing the adjacency of a graph, counts the number of its perfect matchings. Similarly, we express the photon-number cumulants in terms of the Montrealer, a newly introduced matrix function that when applied to a $(0,1)$-matrix counts the number of Hamiltonian cycles of that graph. Based on these graph-theoretic connections, we show that the calculation of photon-number moments and cumulants are #P-hard. Moreover, we provide an exponential time algorithm to calculate Montrealers (and thus cumulants), matching well-known results for Hafnians. We then demonstrate that when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where $K$ identical states are fed into an $\ell$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants as a function of the type of input state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed, or thermal, and as a function of the number of non-vacuum inputs. We find that thermal states perform much worse than other classical states, such as squashed states, at mimicking the photon-number cumulants of lossy or lossless squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Synthesis of Stabilizer Circuits from Clifford Tableaus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since quantum computing is currently in the NISQ-Era, compilation strategies to reduce the number of gates executed on specific hardware are required. In this work, we utilize the concept of synthesis of a data structure called Clifford tableaus, focusing on applying CNOTs within the respective connectivity graph of the quantum device. We hence contribute to the field of compilation or, more precisely, synthesis by reducing the number of CNOTs in the synthesized quantum circuit. Upon convergence, our method shows to outperform other state-of-the-art synthesis techniques, when executed with respect to a specific hardware. Upon executing the resulting circuits on real hardware, our synthesized circuits tend to increase the final fidelity and reduce the overall execution times.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality Broadcasting and Quantum Position Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The no cloning theorem leads to information-theoretic security in various quantum cryptographic protocols. However, this security typically derives from a possibly weaker property that classical information encoded in certain quantum states cannot be broadcast. To formally capture this property, we introduce the study of "orthogonality broadcasting." When attempting to broadcast the orthogonality of two different qubit bases, we establish that the power of classical and quantum communication is equivalent. However, quantum communication is shown to be strictly more powerful for broadcasting orthogonality in higher dimensions. We then relate orthogonality broadcasting to quantum position verification and provide a new method for establishing error bounds. Our key technical contribution is an uncertainty relation that uses the geometric relation of the states that undergo broadcasting rather than the non-commutative aspect of the final measurements.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for classical specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stabiliser formalism plays a central role in quantum computing, error correction, and fault tolerance. Conversions between and verifications of different specifications of stabiliser states and Clifford gates are important components of many classical algorithms in quantum information, e.g. for gate synthesis, circuit optimisation, and simulating quantum circuits. These core functions are also used in the numerical experiments critical to formulating and testing mathematical conjectures on the stabiliser formalism.
  We develop novel mathematical insights concerning stabiliser states and Clifford gates that significantly clarify their descriptions. We then utilise these to provide ten new fast algorithms which offer asymptotic advantages over any existing implementations. We show how to rapidly verify that a vector is a stabiliser state, and interconvert between its specification as amplitudes, a quadratic form, and a check matrix. These methods are leveraged to rapidly check if a given unitary matrix is a Clifford gate and to interconvert between the matrix of a Clifford gate and its compact specification as a stabiliser tableau.
  For example, we extract the stabiliser tableau of a $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix, promised to be a Clifford gate, in $O(n 2^n)$ time. Remarkably, it is not necessary to read all the elements of a Clifford gate matrix to extract its stabiliser tableau. This is an asymptotic speedup over the best-known method that is exponential in the number of qubits.
  We provide implementations of our algorithms in $\texttt{Python}$ and $\texttt{C++}$ that exhibit vastly improved practical performance over existing algorithms in the cases where they exist.</description>

Abstract: The return of the information from the environment to the system is a phenomenon can be related to existence of non-Markovian mechanisms in the environment and such transformation of resources can be useful for quantum information applications. Thus, understanding the details of the system-environment information dynamics, i.e., the transference of quantum resources is of key importance to design noise-resilient quantum technologies. In this work, we show how a quantum resource propagates from the main system to an environment, using as model a single qubit coupled to two linear chains of qubits, and also the information dynamics among the environment qubits. In this way, we characterize the propagation of information leaving the main qubit and going through the environment. Finally, we connect the conditions for the emergence of this dynamics to the existence of quantum Darwinism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering pragmatic and efficient approaches to construct $\varepsilon$-approximations of quantum operators such as real (imaginary) time-evolution propagators in terms of the basic quantum operations (gates) is challenging. Prior $\varepsilon$-approximations are invaluable, in that they enable the compilation of classical and quantum algorithm modeling of, e.g., dynamical and thermodynamic quantum properties. In parallel, symmetries are powerful tools concisely describing the fundamental laws of nature; the symmetric underpinnings of physical laws have consistently provided profound insights and substantially increased predictive power. In this work, we consider the interplay between the $\varepsilon$-approximate processes and the exact symmetries in a semicoherent context -- where measurements occur at each logical clock cycle. We draw inspiration from Pascual Jordan's groundbreaking formulation of nonassociative, but commutative, symmetric algebraic form. Our symmetrized formalism is then applied in various domains such as quantum random walks, real-time evolutions, variational algorithm ansatzes, and efficient entanglement verification. Our work paves the way for a deeper understanding and greater appreciation of how symmetries can be used to control quantum dynamics in settings where coherence is a limited resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of nonclassicality in networks unrelated to Bell's original eponymous theorem has recently attracted significant interest. Here, we identify a sufficient condition for being "outside the shadow of Bell's theorem" and introduce a testable criterion capable of certifying the novelty of instances of network-nonclassicality which we call minimal network nonclassicality. We provide examples of minimally network nonclassical correlations realizable in quantum theory as well as examples coming from more exotic operational probabilistic theories. In particular, we apply these concepts to the simplest configuration of the 3-chain scenario (a.k.a. the bilocality scenario) to prove that certain correlations have escaped the shadow of Bell's theorem. While some of the examples herein are unprecedented, we also revisit more familiar examples of network nonclassicality in order to highlight the contrast between our approach versus prior approaches with respect to assessing novelty.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks will provide unconditional security for communication, computation and distributed sensing tasks. We report on an experimental demonstration of private parameter estimation, which allows a global phase to be evaluated without revealing the constituent local phase values. This is achieved by sharing a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state among three users who first verify the shared state before performing the sensing task. We implement the verification protocol, based on stabilizer measurements, and measure an average failure rate of 0.038(5) which we use to establish the security and privacy parameters. We validate the privacy conditions established by the protocol by evaluating the quantum Fisher information of the experimentally prepared GHZ states.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the unique advantages of quantum mechanics to achieve acceleration over classical computers for certain problems. Currently, various quantum simulators provide powerful tools for researchers, but simulating quantum evolution with these simulators often incurs high time costs. Additionally, resource consumption grows exponentially as the number of quantum bits increases. To address this issue, our research aims to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate quantum circuits. This paper details the process of constructing 1-qubit and 2-qubit quantum simulator models, extending to multiple qubits, and ultimately implementing a 3-qubit example. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can effectively learn and predict the evolution patterns among quantum bits, with minimal error compared to the theoretical output states. Even when dealing with quantum circuits comprising an exponential number of quantum gates, LLMs remain computationally efficient. Overall, our results highlight the potential of LLMs to predict the outputs of complex quantum dynamics, achieving speeds far surpassing those required to run the same process on a quantum computer. This finding provides new insights and tools for applying machine learning methods in the field of quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians is a fundamental task for which it is believed that quantum computers can be helpful. Several approaches have been proposed toward this goal, including algorithms based on quantum phase estimation and hybrid quantum-classical optimizers involving parameterized quantum circuits, the latter falling under the umbrella of the variational quantum eigensolver. Here, we analyze the performance of quantum Boltzmann machines for this task, which is a less explored ansatz based on parameterized thermal states and which is not known to suffer from the barren-plateau problem. We delineate a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for this task and rigorously prove that it converges to an $\varepsilon$-approximate stationary point of the energy function optimized over parameter space, while using a number of parameterized-thermal-state samples that is polynomial in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, the number of parameters, and the norm of the Hamiltonian being optimized. Our algorithm estimates the gradient of the energy function efficiently by means of a novel quantum circuit construction that combines classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test, thus overcoming a key obstacle to quantum Boltzmann machine learning that has been left open since [Amin et al., Phys. Rev. X 8, 021050 (2018)]. Additionally supporting our main claims are calculations of the gradient and Hessian of the energy function, as well as an upper bound on the matrix elements of the latter that is used in the convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Control and Readout Integrated Circuits for Solid-State Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of quantum computing, solid-state quantum systems, particularly superconducting ones, have made remarkable advancements over the past two decades. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing for next-generation applications necessitates the integration of several million qubits, which presents significant challenges in terms of interconnection complexity and latency that are currently unsolvable with state-of-the-art room-temperature control and readout electronics. Recently, cryogenic integrated circuits (ICs), including CMOS radio-frequency ICs and rapid-single-flux-quantum-logic ICs, have emerged as potential alternatives to room-temperature electronics. Unlike their room-temperature counterparts, these ICs are deployed within cryostats to enhance scalability by reducing the number and length of transmission lines. Additionally, operating at cryogenic temperatures can suppress electronic noise and improve qubit control fidelity. However, for CMOS ICs specifically, circuit design uncertainties arise due to a lack of reliable models for cryogenic field effect transistors as well as issues related to severe fickle noises and power dissipation at cryogenic temperatures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on both types of cryogenic control and readout ICs but primarily focuses on the more mature CMOS technology. The discussion encompasses principles underlying control and readout techniques employed in cryogenic CMOS ICs along with their architectural designs; characterization and modeling approaches for field effect transistors under cryogenic conditions; as well as fundamental concepts pertaining to rapid single flux quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Estimation without Controlled Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate the use of adapted classical phase retrieval algorithms to perform control-free quantum phase estimation. We eliminate the costly controlled time evolution and Hadamard test commonly required to access the complex time-series needed to reconstruct the spectrum. This significant reduction of the number of coherent controlled-operations lowers the circuit depth and considerably simplifies the implementation of statistical quantum phase estimation in near-term devices. This seemingly impossible task can be achieved by extending the problem that one wishes to solve to one with a larger set of input signals while exploiting natural constraints on the signal and/or the spectrum. We leverage well-established algorithms that are widely used in the context of classical signal processing, demonstrating two complementary methods to do this, vectorial phase retrieval and two-dimensional phase retrieval. We numerically investigate the feasibility of both approaches for estimating the spectrum of the Fermi-Hubbard model and discuss their resilience to inherent statistical noise.</description>

Abstract: Do physical laws limit the speed of "all data processing systems, manmade as well as biological"? This question proposed and positively answered by H. J. Bremermann in 1962, should be corrected to make it compatible with Einstein's theory of gravity (aka General Relativity, or GR). As a result, the Bremermann's limit, proportional to mass M of any computer, Mc^2/h = ~ (M/gram)10^47 bits per second, should be replaced by the absolute limit (c^5/Gh)^1/2= ~ 10^43 bits per second, where the universal constants c, G, and h are the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and Planck's constant.</description>

      <title>Breaking Rayleigh's curse for two unbalanced single-photon emitters: BLESS technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13244v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rayleigh's criterion states that resolving point sources below the point spread function width is impossible, with error increasing at shorter distances, known as Rayleigh's curse. While detection mode shaping solves this for equal sources, it fails for unbalanced sources with unknown brightness ratios. We propose BLESS, a technique using Beam moduLation and Examination of Shot Statistics, breaking Rayleigh's curse for unbalanced sources. Classical and quantum Cramer-Rao bound calculations show BLESS's strong potential for real imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ) at equilibrium, using exact path integral techniques. Our writing of the effective action makes it clear that the superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ, cannot exist. This can be traced to translational invariances in the Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian making the junction's reduced ground state highly degenerate and actually lacking the symmetry that the transition is supposed to break. For all parameters, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted in part from ill-assuming it would not. Our results fully support and confirm the experimental invalidation of this quantum phase transition by Murani et al. in 2020.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Quantum efficiency and vertical position of quantum emitters in hBN determined by Purcell effect in hybrid metal-dielectric planar photonic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of Levy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetric approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the Efetov's super-symmetric formalism we computed analytically the mean spectral density $\rho(E)$ for the L\'evy and the L\'evy -Rosenzweig-Porter random matrices which off-diagonal elements are strongly non-Gaussian with power-law tails. This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem analytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\rho(E)$ depends crucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the transition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>Impact of parity violation on quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement (QE), evidenced by Bell inequality (BI) violations, reveals the nonlocality of nature. Fundamental interactions manifest in various forms, each with distinct effects on QE and BI, but have not yet been studied in depth. We investigate in detail the relationship between QE, Bell nonlocality, and parity-violating interactions in spin-1/2 bipartite systems arising from the decays of spin-0 and spin-1 particles within the quantum field theory (QFT). Our findings reveal that parity (P) violation can completely disentangle particle pairs, rendering Bell tests ineffective in distinguishing between classical and quantum theories. In the spin-0 case, complete disentanglement occurs at maximal P violation, which is similarly true for spin-1 decays. Without restrictions from the QFT, the predicted relation between entanglement and the Bell nonlocality may no longer be valid and we propose promising methods for testing it. Additionally, we emphasize the previously overlooked influence of magnetic fields within detectors, which alters predictions for QE and Bell nonlocality. This environmental effect induces spurious P and charge-parity (CP) violations and thus has to be subtracted for genuine P, CP, and Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation method called Hamiltonian bootstrap which finds lower bounds to the ground state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian subject to Hermitian linear constraints, along with approximations of the corresponding ground state correlation functions. We show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce both the memory and time requirements, and we include unitary, antiunitary, discrete, and continuous symmetries in our analysis. We demonstrate Hamiltonian bootstrap using the 1D Hubbard model and find quantitative agreement with both exact diagonalization and the Bethe ansatz.</description>

Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

Abstract: With the advent and development of real-world quantum technology applications, a practically-focused quantum education including student quantum experiments are gaining increasing importance in physics curricula. In this paper, using the DeFT framework, we present an analysis of the representations in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment, in order to assess their potential for promoting conceptual learning. We also discuss learner visual attention with respect to the provided multiple representations based on the eye gaze data we have obtained from a pilot study where N=38 students carried out the tasks in our AR-enhanced quantum cryptography student experiment.</description>
