      <title>A Digital Twin-Based Simulation Framework for Safe Curve Speed Estimation Using Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontal curves are often associated with roadway crashes due to speed misjudgment and loss of control. With the growing adoption of autonomous and connected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming increasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve speed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point mass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular and environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based framework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual environment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world horizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a radar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is constructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data. A parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass, acceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and loading scenarios. This simulation identifies the maximum safe speed at which a vehicle can traverse the given curve, providing a more vehicle and environment-specific estimate of the safe operating speed. The study validated that the safe curve speed estimates generated by the simulation were consistent with the real-world speed values observed at a curve. This study demonstrates how a physics-based digital twin can estimate a safer and more adaptive operating speed for vehicles traversing horizontal curves.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Probabilistic Verification and Validation of Vision-Based Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and comprehensive situational awareness is a critical capability of modern autonomous systems. Deep neural networks that perceive task-critical details from rich sensory signals have become ubiquitous; however, their black-box behavior and sensitivity to environmental uncertainty and distribution shifts make them challenging to verify formally. Abstraction-based verification techniques for vision-based autonomy produce safety guarantees contingent on rigid assumptions, such as bounded errors or known unique distributions. Such overly restrictive and inflexible assumptions limit the validity of the guarantees, especially in diverse and uncertain test-time environments. We propose a methodology that unifies the verification models of perception with their offline validation. Our methodology leverages interval MDPs and provides a flexible end-to-end guarantee that adapts directly to the out-of-distribution test-time conditions. We evaluate our methodology on a synthetic perception Markov chain with well-defined state estimation distributions and a mountain car benchmark. Our findings reveal that we can guarantee tight yet rigorous bounds on overall system safety.</description>

      <title>A Data-Based Review of Battery Electric Vehicle and Traction Inverter Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have advanced significantly during the past decade, yet drivetrain energy losses continue to restrict practical range and elevate cost. A dataset comprising more than 1000 European-market BEVs (model years 2010-2025) is combined with detailed inverter-motor co-simulation to chart technology progress for and quantify the efficiency and cost-saving potential of partial-load optimised multi-level inverter (MLI) for 2030. Average drive-cycle range has climbed from 135 km to 455 km, while fleet-average energy consumption has remained virtually constant. Three inverter topologies are assessed to evaluate future efficiency and cost enhancements: a conventional two-level (2L) six halfbridge (B6) inverter with silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and two three-level (3L) T-type neutral point clamped (TNPC) and active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters tailored for partial-load operation. The 3L-TNPC inverter, realised with only 30% additional SiC chip area, lowers drive-cycle drivetrain losses by 0.67 kWh/100 km relative to a SiC 2L-B6 baseline. These results identify partial-load optimised MLIs as a cost-effective route to further reduce BEV energy consumption and total system cost.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of a Hybrid VLC/THz Infrastructure-to-Vehicle Communication System for Intelligent Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication framework to support future 6G-enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in smart cities. Leveraging existing LED streetlighting infrastructure, the system simultaneously delivers energy-efficient illumination and high-speed wireless connectivity. The proposed scheme integrates visible light communication (VLC) with a complementary ter-ahertz (THz) antenna array to overcome VLC limitations under high ambient light and adverse weather conditions. Key con-tributions include the design of a VLC/THz access network, seamless integration with lighting infrastructure, a proposed switching-combination (PSC) mechanism, and a physical layout optimization strategy. Using a grid search method, thousands of configurations were evaluated to maximize lighting coverage, re-ceived power, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), and minimize outage probability. Results show that optimized lighting coverage improves from 35% to 97%, while hybrid communication coverage increases from 49%to 99.9% at the same power level. Under extreme environmental conditions, the hybrid system maintains up to 99% coverage, compared to 69% with VLC alone. These results demonstrate the scalability, cost-efficiency, and practicality of the proposed system for next-generation ITS deployment.</description>

      <title>Autonomy at Levels for Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomy at Levels is the idea that autonomy should be embedded within and throughout a spacecraft. Using Systems Engineering methods a spacecraft is typically decomposed into systems, subsystems, assemblies, components, and so on. All these decomposition levels within all the spacecraft's systems, could and should have autonomy elements built in. As a result, the "autonomy system" is made of autonomy elements or units that are integrated, distributed and embedded within the whole spacecraft. This is like how the power system would be designed and implemented. Linking control loops and autonomy loops illustrates how to achieve Autonomy at Levels.</description>

      <title>Robust tracking MPC for perturbed nonlinear systems -- Extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust predictive controller for constrained nonlinear systems that is able to track piece-wise constant setpoint signals. The tracking model predictive controller presented in this paper extends the nonlinear MPC for tracking to the more complex case of nonlinear systems subject to bounded and not necessarily additive perturbations. The optimal control problem that is solved at each step penalizes the deviation of the predicted nominal system trajectory from an artificial reference, which is added as a decision variable, as well as the distance between the artificial reference and the setpoint. Robust feasibility is ensured by imposing conservative constraints that take into account the effect of uncertainties and convergence to a neighborhood of any feasible setpoint is guaranteed by means of an appropriate terminal cost and an extended stabilizing terminal constraint. In the case of unreachable setpoints, convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal reachable steady output is also proved.</description>

      <title>Grid-Edge Energy-Flexible Technologies: A Comparative Analysis Across Generators, Loads, and Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review analysis presents a comprehensive exploration of energy flexibility in modern power systems. It examines the roles and mechanisms of flexible technologies across three main categories: generators, energy storage systems (ESS), and loads. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability to dynamically adjust supply and/or demand in response to grid conditions to maintain balance and stability. This is of particular importance to facilitate the integration of the growing variable renewable energy sources (RES) into modern power grids. Additionally, traditional supply-side mechanisms to maintain balance and stability are complemented by advancements in demand-side management and demand response strategies, which enable loads to adjust consumption patterns and schedules in response to grid requirements. ESS are also explored to further enhance flexibility by absorbing excess generation and/or supplying large load increases that are not able to be met by the less flexible resources. This paper also explores specific flexibility technologies, examining their characteristics, control strategies, advantages, and limitations. Energy flexibility services are also categorized into intermittency mitigation, peak shaving, and energy reserve provisioning. Each service is supported by case studies and examples demonstrating how different resources respond to varying conditions. Ultimately, the findings and reviews of the various flexible resources in this paper provide a roadmap for optimizing energy flexibility across diverse resource types, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient energy future.</description>

      <title>Iterative Youla-Kucera Loop Shaping For Precision Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerically robust approach to multi-band disturbance rejection using an iterative Youla-Kucera parameterization technique. The proposed method offers precise control over shaping the frequency response of a feedback loop while maintaining numerical stability through a systematic design process. By implementing an iterative approach, we overcome a critical numerical issue in rejecting vibrations with multiple frequency bands. Meanwhile, our proposed modification of the all-stabilizing Youla-Kucera architecture enables intuitive design while respecting fundamental performance trade-offs and minimizing undesired waterbed amplifications. Numerical validation on a hard disk drive servo system demonstrates significant performance improvements, enabling enhanced positioning precision for increased storage density. The design methodology extends beyond storage systems to various high-precision control applications where multi-band disturbance rejection is critical.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Decomposed Learning for Quadrotor Geometric Attitude Control with Almost Global Exponential Convergence on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable online learning approach called Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. As a module instance of DiD-L, we propose the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM). Specifically, to address underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without the persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the state solution of the rotational error dynamics exponentially converges into an arbitrarily small ball within an almost global attraction domain, despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unseen disturbances and specific knowledge of the model. To our knowledge in the quadrotor control field, DiD-L is the first online learning approach that is lightweight enough to run in real-time at 400 Hz on microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, and has been validated through real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Parallel-Connected Lithium-Ion Battery Pack Dynamics with Interconnection Resistances as Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents analytical solutions for the current distribution in lithium-ion battery packs composed of cells connected in parallel, explicitly accounting for the presence of interconnection resistances. These solutions enable the reformulation of the differential-algebraic equations describing the pack dynamics into a set of ordinary differential equations, thereby simplifying simulation and analysis. Conditions under which uniform current sharing across all cells occurs are also derived. The proposed formulation is validated against experimental data and confirms its ability to capture the key behaviours induced by interconnection resistances. These results can support the improved design and control of parallel-connected battery packs.</description>

      <title>Markov Chain-based Model of Blockchain Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security has always been a priority, for researchers, service providers and network operators when it comes to radio access networks (RAN). One wireless access approach that has captured attention is blockchain enabled RAN (B-RAN) due to its secure nature. This research introduces a framework that integrates blockchain technology into RAN while also addressing the limitations of state-of-the-art models. The proposed framework utilizes queuing and Markov chain theory to model the aspects of B-RAN. An extensive evaluation of the models performance is provided, including an analysis of timing factors and a focused assessment of its security aspects. The results demonstrate reduced latency and comparable security making the presented framework suitable for diverse application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multiple Fault Detection and Estimation in DC Microgrids with Unknown Power Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed diagnosis scheme to detect and estimate actuator and power line faults in DC microgrids subject to unknown power loads and stochastic noise. To address actuator faults, we design a fault estimation filter whose parameters are determined through a tractable optimization problem to achieve fault estimation, decoupling from power line faults, and robustness against noise. In contrast, the estimation of power line faults poses greater challenges due to the inherent coupling between fault currents and unknown power loads, which becomes ill-posed when the underlying system is insufficiently excited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address this critical yet underexplored issue. Our solution introduces a novel differentiate-before-estimate strategy. A set of diagnostic rules based on the temporal characteristics of a constructed residual is developed to distinguish load changes from line faults. Once a power line fault is detected, a regularized least-squares method is activated to estimate the fault currents, for which we further derive an upper bound on the estimation error. Finally, comprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14677v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</description>

      <title>Optimal Unpredictable Control for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how to achieve the unpredictability against malicious inferences for linear systems. The key idea is to add stochastic control inputs, named as unpredictable control, to make the outputs irregular. The future outputs thus become unpredictable and the performance of inferences is degraded. The major challenges lie in: i) how to formulate optimization problems to obtain an optimal distribution of stochastic input, under unknown prediction accuracy of the adversary; and ii) how to achieve the trade-off between the unpredictability and control performance. We first utilize both variance and confidence probability of prediction error to quantify unpredictability, then formulate two two-stage stochastic optimization problems, respectively. Under variance metric, the analytic optimal distribution of control input is provided. With probability metric, it is a non-convex optimization problem, thus we present a novel numerical method and convert the problem into a solvable linear optimization problem. Last, we quantify the control performance under unpredictable control, and accordingly design the unpredictable LQR and cooperative control. Simulations demonstrate the unpredictability of our control algorithm. The obtained optimal distribution outperforms Gaussian and Laplace distributions commonly used in differential privacy under proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>Recursive Gaussian Process Regression with Integrated Monotonicity Assumptions for Control Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14715v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension to the recursive Gaussian Process (RGP) regression that enables the satisfaction of inequality constraints and is well suited for a real-time execution in control applications. The soft inequality constraints are integrated by introducing an additional extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update step using pseudo-measurements. The sequential formulation of the algorithm and several developed heuristics ensure both the performance and a low computational effort of the algorithm. A special focus lies on an efficient consideration of monotonicity assumptions for GPs in the form of inequality constraints. The algorithm is statistically validated in simulations, where the possible advantages in comparison with the standard RGP algorithm become obvious.

      <title>Beyond Fixed Morphologies: Learning Graph Policies with Trust Region Compensation in Variable Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study morphological generalization.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Tracking Control for Computationally Constrained Aerial Systems with the Newton-Raphson Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms' computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy expenditure.</description>

      <title>Reliability comparison of vessel trajectory prediction models via Probability of Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future inland waterways navigation.</description>

      <title>Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.</description>

      <title>A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation scheme for estimating the states and time-varying parameters of nonlinear systems. We consider the case where observability of the parameters depends on the excitation of the system and may be absent during operation, with the parameter dynamics fulfilling a weak incremental bounded-energy bounded-state property to ensure boundedness of the estimation error (with respect to the disturbance energy). The proposed estimation scheme involves a standard quadratic cost function with an adaptive regularization term depending on the current parameter observability. We develop robustness guarantees for the overall estimation error that are valid for all times, and that improve the more often the parameters are detected to be observable during operation. The theoretical results are illustrated by a simulation example.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic Energy Management Strategies With Interacting Agents in Formula 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an interaction-aware energy management optimization framework for Formula 1 racing. The considered scenario involves two agents and a drag reduction model. Strategic interactions between the agents are captured by a Stackelberg game formulated as a bilevel program. To address the computational challenges associated with bilevel optimization, the problem is reformulated as a single-level nonlinear program employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The proposed framework contributes towards the development of new energy management and allocation strategies, caused by the presence of another agent. For instance, it provides valuable insights on how to redistribute the energy in order to optimally exploit the wake effect, showcasing a notable difference with the behavior studied in previous works. Robust energy allocations can be identified to reduce the lap time loss associated with unexpected choices of the other agent. It allows to recognize the boundary conditions for the interaction to become relevant, impacting the system's behavior, and to assess if overtaking is possible and beneficial. Overall, the framework provides a comprehensive approach for a two-agent Formula 1 racing problem with strategic interactions, offering physically intuitive and practical results.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance for Convex Primitives via Differentiable Optimization Based High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of dynamical systems is crucial, where collision avoidance is a primary concern. Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient System Identification via Lipschitz Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting dynamic models from data is of enormous importance in understanding the properties of unknown systems. In this work, we employ Lipschitz neural networks, a class of neural networks with a prescribed upper bound on their Lipschitz constant, to address the problem of data-efficient nonlinear system identification. Under the (fairly weak) assumption that the unknown system is Lipschitz continuous, we propose a method to estimate the approximation error bound of the trained network and the bound on the difference between the simulated trajectories by the trained models and the true system. Empirical results show that our method outperforms classic fully connected neural networks and Lipschitz regularized networks through simulation studies on three dynamical systems, and the advantage of our method is more noticeable when less data is used for training.</description>

      <title>Beyond Quadratic Costs: A Bregman Divergence Approach to H$_\infty$ Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past couple of decades, non-quadratic convex penalties have reshaped signal processing and machine learning; in robust control, however, general convex costs break the Riccati and storage function structure that make the design tractable. Practitioners thus default to approximations, heuristics or robust model predictive control that are solved online for short horizons. We close this gap by extending $H_\infty$ control of discrete-time linear systems to strictly convex penalties on state, input, and disturbance, recasting the objective with Bregman divergences that admit a completion-of-squares decomposition. The result is a closed-form, time-invariant, full-information stabilizing controller that minimizes a worst-case performance ratio over the infinite horizon. Necessary and sufficient existence/optimality conditions are given by a Riccati-like identity together with a concavity requirement; with quadratic costs, these collapse to the classical $H_\infty$ algebraic Riccati equation and the associated negative-semidefinite condition, recovering the linear central controller. Otherwise, the optimal controller is nonlinear and can enable safety envelopes, sparse actuation, and bang-bang policies with rigorous $H_\infty$ guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile: A Perspective from Parameter Responses in Reinforcement Learning Under Stress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following problem: maximize the amplitude $|x_t|$ at time $t$, over all complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of arbitrary homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the characteristic roots in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any triple $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained with coinciding roots on the boundary circle; in particular, this implies that the peak amplitude $\sup_{t \ge n} |x_t|$ can be maximized explicitly, by studying a unique equation with the characteristic polynomial $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the cophase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. We propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>
