      <title>Toward a Cognitive Data Model: Exploring a Mind-Inspired Approach to Database Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cognitive Data Model (CDM) is proposed. A novel approach to database design, inspired by the belief that the human brain operates with a logical data model independent of its anatomical structure. The study aims to identify and replicate this CDM to enhance database design, resolving limitations of the existing models in handling complex relationships, scalability, and adaptability. The methodology involves empirical observation, cognitive experiments, iterative modelling and critical thinking. Findings suggest that the information processing in the brain occurs sequentially with forming associations on atomic static data in a pairwise, time dependent manner. This insight led to the development of a meta framework for the brain's information processing to design CDM based on it. The CDM offers improved data modelling and database design, efficient querying, and potential applications in AI, machine learning, and big data analytics. Future research will focus on formalizing the model, implementing it in 3D environments, and developing a query language.</description>

      <title>Approximating Opaque Top-k Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining query answering and data science workloads has become prevalent. An important class of such workloads is top-k queries with a scoring function implemented as an opaque UDF - a black box whose internal structure and scores on the search domain are unavailable. Some typical examples include costly calls to fuzzy classification and regression models. The models may also be changed in an ad-hoc manner. Since the algorithm does not know the scoring function's behavior on the input data, opaque top-k queries become expensive to evaluate exactly or speed up by indexing. Hence, we propose an approximation algorithm for opaque top-k query answering. Our proposed solution is a task-independent hierarchical index and a novel bandit algorithm. The index clusters elements by some cheap vector representation then builds a tree of the clusters. Our bandit is a diminishing returns submodular epsilon-greedy bandit algorithm that maximizes the sum of the solution set's scores. Our bandit models the distribution of scores in each arm using a histogram, then targets arms with fat tails. We prove that our bandit algorithm approaches a constant factor of the optimal algorithm. We evaluate our standalone library on large synthetic, image, and tabular datasets over a variety of scoring functions. Our method accelerates the time required to achieve nearly optimal scores by up to an order of magnitude compared to exhaustive scan while consistently outperforming baseline sampling algorithms.</description>

      <title>Factorised Representations of Join Queries: Tight Bounds and a New Dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common theme in factorised databases and knowledge compilation is the representation of solution sets in a useful yet succinct data structure. In this paper, we study the representation of the result of join queries (or, equivalently, the set of homomorphisms between two relational structures). We focus on the very general format of $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits -- also known as d-representations or DNNF circuits -- and aim to find the limits of this approach.
  In prior work, it has been shown that there always exists a $\{\cup, \times\}$-circuits-circuit of size $N^{O(subw)}$ representing the query result, where N is the size of the database and subw the submodular width of the query. If the arity of all relations is bounded by a constant, then subw is linear in the treewidth tw of the query. In this setting, the authors of this paper proved a lower bound of $N^{\Omega(tw^{\varepsilon})}$ on the circuit size (ICALP 2023), where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ depends on the excluded grid theorem.
  Our first main contribution is to improve this lower bound to $N^{\Omega(tw)}$, which is tight up to a constant factor in the exponent. Our second contribution is a $N^{\Omega(subw^{1/4})}$ lower bound on the circuit size for join queries over relations of unbounded arity. Both lower bounds are unconditional lower bounds on the circuit size for well-chosen database instances. Their proofs use a combination of structural (hyper)graph theory with communication complexity in a simple yet novel way. While the second lower bound is asymptotically equivalent to Marx's conditional bound on the decision complexity (JACM 2013), our $N^{\Theta(tw)}$ bound in the bounded-arity setting is tight, while the best conditional bound on the decision complexity is $N^{\Omega(tw/\log tw)}$. Note that, removing this logarithmic factor in the decision setting is a major open problem.</description>

      <title>RED2Hunt: an Actionable Framework for Cleaning Operational Databases with Surrogate Keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate keys are now extensively utilized by database designers to implement keys in SQL tables. They are straightforward, easy to understand, and enable efficient access, despite lacking any real-world semantic meaning. In this context, complex redundancy issues might emerge and often go unnoticed as long as they do not affect the operational applications built on top of the databases. These issues become evident when organizations seek to leverage data science, posing significant challenges to the implementation of analytical projects.
  This paper, grounded in real-world applications, defines the concept of artificial unicity and proposes RED2Hunt (RElational Databases REDundancy Hunting), a human-in-the-loop framework for identifying hidden redundancy and, if problems occur, cleaning relational databases implemented with surrogate keys. We first define the central and intricate notion of artificial unicity and then the RED2Hunt framework to address it. We rely on simple abstractions easy to visualize based on the so-called redundancy profile associated to some relations and the notion of attribute stability. Quite interestingly, those profiles can be computed very efficiently in quasi-linear time. We have devised different metrics to guide the domain expert and an actionable framework to generate new redundancy-free databases. The proposed framework was implemented on top of PostgreSQL. From the publicly available IMDB database, we have generated synthetic databases, implementing different redundancy scenarios, on which we tested RED2Hunt to study its scalability. RED2Hunt has also been tested on operational databases implemented with surrogate keys. Lessons learned from these real-life applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>ExCoT: Optimizing Reasoning for Text-to-SQL with Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL demands precise reasoning to convert natural language questions into structured queries. While large language models (LLMs) excel in many reasoning tasks, their ability to leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for text-to-SQL remains underexplored. We identify critical limitations: zero-shot CoT offers minimal gains, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied without CoT yields marginal improvements. We propose ExCoT, a novel framework that iteratively optimizes open-source LLMs by combining CoT reasoning with off-policy and on-policy DPO, relying solely on execution accuracy as feedback. This approach eliminates the need for reward models or human-annotated preferences.
  Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains: ExCoT improves execution accuracy on BIRD dev set from 57.37% to 68.51% and on Spider test set from 78.81% to 86.59% for LLaMA-3 70B, with Qwen-2.5-Coder demonstrating similar improvements. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the single-model setting on both BIRD and Spider datasets, notably achieving 68.53% on the BIRD test set.</description>

      <title>Finding Near-Optimal Maximum Set of Disjoint $k$-Cliques in Real-World Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-clique is a dense graph, consisting of $k$ fully-connected nodes, that finds numerous applications, such as community detection and network analysis. In this paper, we study a new problem, that finds a maximum set of disjoint $k$-cliques in a given large real-world graph with a user-defined fixed number $k$, which can contribute to a good performance of teaming collaborative events in online games. However, this problem is NP-hard when $k \geq 3$, making it difficult to solve. To address that, we propose an efficient lightweight method that avoids significant overheads and achieves a $k$-approximation to the optimal, which is equipped with several optimization techniques, including the ordering method, degree estimation in the clique graph, and a lightweight implementation. Besides, to handle dynamic graphs that are widely seen in real-world social networks, we devise an efficient indexing method with careful swapping operations, leading to the efficient maintenance of a near-optimal result with frequent updates in the graph. In various experiments on several large graphs, our proposed approaches significantly outperform the competitors by up to 2 orders of magnitude in running time and 13.3\% in the number of computed disjoint $k$-cliques, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Triangle Detection and Enumeration Hardness for Unions of Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11996v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs) with optimal time guarantees. More precisely, we wish to identify the queries that can be solved with linear preprocessing time and constant delay. Despite the basic nature of this problem, it was shown only recently that UCQs can be solved within these time bounds if they admit free-connex union extensions, even if all individual CQs in the union are intractable with respect to the same complexity measure. Our goal is to understand whether there exist additional tractable UCQs, not covered by the currently known algorithms. As a first step, we show that some previously unclassified UCQs are hard using the classic 3SUM hypothesis, via a known reduction from 3SUM to triangle listing in graphs. As a second step, we identify a question about a variant of this graph task that is unavoidable if we want to classify all self-join-free UCQs: is it possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a vertex-unbalanced tripartite graph in linear time? We prove that this task is equivalent in hardness to some family of UCQs. Finally, we show a dichotomy for unions of two self-join-free CQs if we assume the answer to this question is negative. In conclusion, this paper pinpoints a computational barrier in the form of a single decision problem that is key to advancing our understanding of the enumeration complexity of many UCQs. Without a breakthrough for unbalanced triangle detection, we have no hope of finding an efficient algorithm for additional unions of two self-join-free CQs. On the other hand, a sufficiently efficient unbalanced triangle detection algorithm can be turned into an efficient algorithm for a family of UCQs currently not known to be tractable.</description>

      <title>HybEA: Hybrid Models for Entity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity Alignment (EA) aims to detect descriptions of the same real-world entities among different Knowledge Graphs (KG). Several embedding methods have been proposed to rank potentially matching entities of two KGs according to their similarity in the embedding space. However, existing EA embedding methods are challenged by the diverse levels of structural (i.e., neighborhood entities) and semantic (e.g., entity names and literal property values) heterogeneity exhibited by real-world KGs, especially when they are spanning several domains (DBpedia, Wikidata). Existing methods either focus on one of the two heterogeneity kinds depending on the context (mono- vs multi-lingual). To address this limitation, we propose a flexible framework called HybEA, that is a hybrid of two models, a novel attention-based factual model, co-trained with a state-of-the-art structural model. Our experimental results demonstrate that HybEA outperforms the state-of-the-art EA systems, achieving a 16% average relative improvement of Hits@1, ranging from 3.6% up to 40% in 5 monolingual datasets, with some datasets that can now be considered as solved. We also show that HybEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3 multi-lingual datasets, as well as on 2 datasets that drop the unrealistic, yet widely adopted, one-to-one assumption. Overall, HybEA outperforms all (11) baseline methods in all (3) measures and in all (10) datasets evaluated, with a statistically significant difference.</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication meets the Submodular Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One fundamental question in database theory is the following: Given a Boolean conjunctive query Q, what is the best complexity for computing the answer to Q in terms of the input database size N? When restricted to the class of combinatorial algorithms, it is known that the best known complexity for any query Q is captured by the submodular width of Q. However, beyond combinatorial algorithms, certain queries are known to admit faster algorithms that often involve a clever combination of fast matrix multiplication and data partitioning. Nevertheless, there is no systematic way to derive and analyze the complexity of such algorithms for arbitrary queries Q.
  In this work, we introduce a general framework that captures the best complexity for answering any Boolean conjunctive query Q using matrix multiplication. Our framework unifies both combinatorial and non-combinatorial techniques under the umbrella of information theory. It generalizes the notion of submodular width to a new stronger notion called the omega-submodular width that naturally incorporates the power of fast matrix multiplication. We describe a matching algorithm that computes the answer to any query Q in time corresponding to the omega-submodular width of Q. We show that our framework recovers the best known complexities for Boolean queries that have been studied in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, and also discovers new algorithms for some classes of queries that improve upon the best known complexities.</description>

      <title>CCaaLF: Concurrency Control as a Learnable Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concurrency control (CC) algorithms are important in modern transactional databases, as they enable high performance by executing transactions concurrently while ensuring correctness. However, state-of-the-art CC algorithms struggle to perform well across diverse workloads, and most do not consider workload drifts.
  In this paper, we propose CCaaLF (Concurrency Control as a Learnable Function), a novel learned concurrency control algorithm designed to achieve high performance across varying workloads. The algorithm is quick to optimize, making it robust against dynamic workloads. CCaaLF learns an agent function that captures a large number of design choices from existing CC algorithms. The function is implemented as an efficient in-database lookup table that maps database states to concurrency control actions. The learning process is based on a combination of Bayesian optimization and a novel graph reduction algorithm, which converges quickly to a function that achieves high transaction throughput. We compare CCaaLF against five state-of-the-art CC algorithms and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms them in terms of transaction throughput and optimization time.</description>

      <title>Semiring Provenance for Lightweight Description Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiring provenance--a successful framework originally defined in the relational database setting--for description logics. In this context, the ontology axioms are annotated with elements of a commutative semiring and these annotations are propagated to the ontology consequences in a way that reflects how they are derived. We define a provenance semantics for a language that encompasses several lightweight description logics and show its relationships with semantics that have been defined for ontologies annotated with a specific kind of annotation (such as fuzzy degrees). We show that under some restrictions on the semiring, the semantics satisfies desirable properties (such as extending the semiring provenance defined for databases). We then focus on the well-known why-provenance, for which we study the complexity of problems related to the provenance of an assertion or a conjunctive query answer. Finally, we consider two more restricted cases which correspond to the so-called positive Boolean provenance and lineage in the database setting. For these cases, we exhibit relationships with well-known notions related to explanations in description logics and complete our complexity analysis. As a side contribution, we provide conditions on an $\mathcal{ELHI}_\bot$ ontology that guarantee tractable reasoning.</description>
