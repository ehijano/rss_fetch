      <title>Overlapping community detection algorithms using Modularity and the cosine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of network community detection has been extensively studied across many fields. Most community detection methods assume that nodes belong to only one community. However, in many cases, nodes can belong to multiple communities simultaneously.This paper presents two overlapping network community detection algorithms that build on the two-step approach, using the extended modularity and cosine function. The applicability of our algorithms extends to both undirected and directed graph structures. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of these algorithms, we conducted experiments using real data.</description>

      <title>An improvement on the Louvain algorithm using random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will present improvements to famous algorithms for community detection, namely Newman's spectral method algorithm and the Louvain algorithm. The Newman algorithm begins by treating the original graph as a single cluster, then repeats the process to split each cluster into two, based on the signs of the eigenvector corresponding to the secondlargest eigenvalue. Our improvement involves replacing the time-consuming computation of eigenvalues with a random walk during the splitting process. The Louvain algorithm iteratively performs the following steps until no increase in modularity can be achieved anymore: each step consists of two phases, phase 1 for partitioning the graph into clusters, and phase 2 for constructing a new graph where each vertex represents one cluster obtained from phase 1. We propose an improvement to this algorithm by adding our random walk algorithm as an additional phase for refining clusters obtained from phase 1. It maintains a complexity comparable to the Louvain algorithm while exhibiting superior efficiency. To validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conducted experiments using randomly generated graphs and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Negative Impact of Online Political Incivility on Willingness to See Political Comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been significant attention on online political incivility. While previous research suggests that uncivil political comments lead people to be less willing to see more comments on the same issue, two critical questions have received limited exploration: (1) Are people exposed to uncivil political comments less willing to see other comments from the person who posted the uncivil comment?; (2) Are people exposed to uncivil political comments less willing to see comments from people who have different thoughts than them? To address these questions, the present study conducted a preregistered online survey experiment targeting Japanese citizens, focusing on the pro- vs anti-Kishida cabinet conflict in Japan. The results show that the participants were less willing to see other comments by the person who posted the comment when the comment was uncivil than when it was civil. In addition, the anti-Kishida participants were less willing to see political opinions posted online by people who have different thoughts than them when the comment was uncivil than when it was civil, while the participants in the other subgroups did not show a similar tendency. These findings suggest that uncivil expressions in online political communication might prompt people to avoid reading opinions from those who have different thoughts than them, which might promote political echo chambers.</description>

      <title>A Prediction Model for Rumor Forwarding Behavior Based on Uncertain Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets. This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</description>

      <title>The role of susceptible individuals in spreading dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the internal mechanism of information spreading is critical for understanding and controlling the process. Traditional spreading models often assume individuals play the same role in the spreading process. In reality, however, individuals' diverse characteristics contribute differently to the spreading performance, leading to a heterogeneous infection rate across the system. To investigate network spreading dynamics under heterogeneous infection rates, we integrate two individual-level features -- influence (i.e., the ability to influence neighbors) and susceptibility (i.e., the extent to be influenced by neighbors) -- into the independent cascade model. Our findings reveal significant differences in spreading performance under heterogeneous and constant infection rates, with traditional structural centrality metrics proving more effective in the latter scenario. Additionally, we take the constant and heterogeneous infection rates into a state-of-the-art maximization algorithm, the well-known TIM algorithm, and find the seeds selected by heterogeneous infection rates are more dispersed compared to those under constant rates. Lastly, we find that both individuals' influence and susceptibility are vital to the spreading performance. Strikingly, susceptible individuals are particularly important to spreading when information is disseminated by social celebrities. By integrating influence and susceptibility into the spreading model, we gain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving information spreading.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction for Social Networks using Representation Learning and Heuristic-based Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in scale and relevance of social networks enable them to provide expansive insights. Predicting missing links in social networks efficiently can help in various modern-day business applications ranging from generating recommendations to influence analysis. Several categories of solutions exist for the same. Here, we explore various feature extraction techniques to generate representations of nodes and edges in a social network that allow us to predict missing links. We compare the results of using ten feature extraction techniques categorized across Structural embeddings, Neighborhood-based embeddings, Graph Neural Networks, and Graph Heuristics, followed by modeling with ensemble classifiers and custom Neural Networks. Further, we propose combining heuristic-based features and learned representations that demonstrate improved performance for the link prediction task on social network datasets. Using this method to generate accurate recommendations for many applications is a matter of further study that appears very promising. The code for all the experiments has been made public.</description>

      <title>Epidemic modelling requires knowledge of the social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compartmental models of epidemics are widely used to forecast the effects of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 and to guide policy. Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of random mixing is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, super-spreading events have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given $R_0$; and a (more significant) overestimation of $R_0$ itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease. It is therefore crucial to incorporate network information into standard models of epidemics.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Modeling for Positive and Negative Preferences in Sign-Aware Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, sign-aware graph recommendation has drawn much attention as it will learn users' negative preferences besides positive ones from both positive and negative interactions (i.e., links in a graph) with items. To accommodate the different semantics of negative and positive links, existing works utilize two independent encoders to model users' positive and negative preferences, respectively. However, these approaches cannot learn the negative preferences from high-order heterogeneous interactions between users and items formed by multiple links with different signs, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete negative user preferences. To cope with these intractable issues, we propose a novel \textbf{L}ight \textbf{S}igned \textbf{G}raph Convolution Network specifically for \textbf{Rec}ommendation (\textbf{LSGRec}), which adopts a unified modeling approach to simultaneously model high-order users' positive and negative preferences on a signed user-item interaction graph. Specifically, for the negative preferences within high-order heterogeneous interactions, first-order negative preferences are captured by the negative links, while high-order negative preferences are propagated along positive edges. Then, recommendation results are generated based on positive preferences and optimized with negative ones. Finally, we train representations of users and items through different auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines regarding performance and computational efficiency. Our code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LSGRec-BB95}.</description>

Abstract: The ongoing debate surrounding the impact of the Internet Research Agency s (IRA) social media campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election has largely overshadowed the involvement of other actors. Our analysis brings to light a substantial group of suspended Twitter users, outnumbering the IRA user group by a factor of 60, who align with the ideologies of the IRA campaign. Our study demonstrates that this group of suspended Twitter accounts significantly influenced individuals categorized as undecided or weak supporters, potentially with the aim of swaying their opinions, as indicated by Granger causality.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks shape opinions, behaviors, and information dissemination in human societies. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social interactions and networks becomes essential. Our study analyzes LLMs' network formation behavior to examine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs are similar to or different from human social dynamics. We observe that LLMs exhibit key social network principles, including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon, when asked about their preferences in network formation. We also investigate LLMs' decision-making based on real-world networks, revealing that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs perform well in network formation predictions. Overall, our study opens up new possibilities for using LLMs in network science research and helps develop socially aware LLMs by shedding light on their network formation behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics.</description>

      <title>Socio-spatial segregation and human mobility: A review of empirical evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social segregation, the spatial and social separation between individuals from different backgrounds, can affect sustainable urban development and social cohesion. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on income, ethnicity, and education. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation because daily activities often extend far beyond residential areas. Over the past one to two decades, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that day-to-day movements can impact segregation by reducing or amplifying segregation levels obtained when considering residential aspects alone. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) to what extent do individual mobility patterns contribute to segregation? (b) Which factors explain the role played by mobility in segregation? and (c) What insights are gained by incorporating extensive mobility data into segregation research? Our literature review contributes to an improved understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and offers actionable insights into reducing segregation and addressing research gaps in the field.</description>

      <title>Open Source Software Field Research: Spanning Social and Practice Networks for Re-Entering the Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sociotechnical research increasingly includes the social sub-networks that emerge from large-scale sociotechnical infrastructure, including the infrastructure for building open source software. This paper addresses these numerous sub-networks as advantageous for researchers. It provides a methodological synthesis focusing on how researchers can best span adjacent social sub-networks during engaged field research. Specifically, we describe practices and artifacts that aid movement from one social subsystem within a more extensive technical infrastructure to another. To surface the importance of spanning sub-networks, we incorporate a discussion of social capital and the role of technical infrastructure in its development for sociotechnical researchers. We then characterize a five-step process for spanning social sub-networks during engaged field research: commitment, context mapping, jargon competence, returning value, and bridging. We then present our experience studying corporate open source software projects and the role of that experience in accelerating our work in open source scientific software research as described through the lens of bridging social capital. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations for engaging in fieldwork in adjacent social sub-networks that share a technical context and discussion of how the relationship between social and technically acquired social capital is a missing but critical methodological dimension for research on large-scale sociotechnical research.</description>
