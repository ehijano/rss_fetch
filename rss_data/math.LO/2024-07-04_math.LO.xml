      <title>On foundations for deductive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article was motivated by the discovery of a potential new foundation for mainstream mathematics. The goals are to clarify the relationships between primitives, foundations, and deductive practice; to understand how to determine what is, or isn't, a foundation; and get clues as to how a foundation can be optimized for effective human use.
  For this we turn to history and professional practice of the subject. We have no asperations to Philosophy.
  The first section gives a short abstract discussion, focusing on the significance of consistency. The next briefly describes foundations, explicit and implicit, at a few key periods in mathematical history. We see, for example, that at the primitive level human intuitions are essential, but can be problematic. We also see that traditional axiomatic set theories, Zermillo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) in particular, are not quite consistent with mainstream practice. The final section sketches the proposed new foundation and gives the basic argument that it is uniquely qualified to be considered {the} foundation of mainstream deductive mathematics. The ``coherent limit axiom'' characterizes the new theory among ZFC-like theories. This axiom plays a role in recursion, but is implicitly assumed in mainstream work so does not provide new leverage there. In principle it should settle set-theory questions such as the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Functional variant of Polynomial Analogue of Gandy's Fixed Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a functional variant of the polynomial analogue of the classical Gandy's fixed point theorem is obtained. Sufficient conditions have been found to ensure that the complexity of the recursive function does not go beyond the polynomial. In 2021, we proved a polynomial analogue of the classical Gandy's fixed point theorem. This became an important impetus for the construction of p-complete programming languages. And such a language was first built by us in 2022. The main result of that work was: a solution of the problem P=L. Next are the followers of the works on building a new high-level language and the idea of building a general programming methodology. But there was one gap in our research: classes of recursive functions whose complexity was polynomial were not described. In this work we found sufficient conditions for such functions. In many ways, the main ideas of this work are similar to the ideas that we used in the proof of the polynomial analogue of Gandy's fixed point theorem. But there are also striking differences. Functions, as such, differ quite strongly from predicates precisely in the multitude of their values. If a predicate is either true or false, then a function can generally take on a variety of values. Moreover, even if there are not many values, but there is recursion and simple multiplication, then powers and factorials may arise during the calculations, which, of course, can violate the polynomial computational complexity of this function. Therefore, finding these restrictions on recursive functions that would be soft enough for the class of functions to be large, and at the same time tough enough not to go beyond polynomiality, has been a problem for us for the last 3 years, after the proof of the polynomial analogue Gandy's fixed point theorem in the case of predicate extensions.</description>

      <title>A category of arrow algebras for modified realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we further the study of arrow algebras, simple algebraic structures inducing toposes through the tripos-to-topos construction, by defining appropriate notions of morphisms between them which correspond to morphisms of the associated triposes. Specializing to geometric inclusions, we characterize subtriposes of an arrow tripos in terms of nuclei on the underlying arrow algebra, recovering a classical locale-theoretic result. As an example of application, we lift modified realizability to the setting of arrow algebras, and we establish its functoriality.</description>

      <title>Skelet #17 and the fifth Busy Beaver number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove nonhalting of the Turing machine dubbed "Skelet #17", known to be one of the toughest 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machines to analyze. Combined with the efforts of The Busy Beaver Challenge, we are therefore able to show that BB(5), the fifth Busy Beaver number, equals 47,176,870.</description>
