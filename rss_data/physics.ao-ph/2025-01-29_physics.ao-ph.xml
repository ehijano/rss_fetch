      <title>An oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism for tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tides represent the daily alternations of high and low waters along coastlines and in oceans, and the current theory (termed the gravitational forcing mechanism) explains them as a manifestation of the response of ocean water to the Moon's (Sun's) gravitational force. However, although the purely hydrodynamic models representing the current theory have been widely tested over global ocean,their tidal elevation accuracies are generally low. This implies an uncertainty as to whether the gravitational forcing mechanism is the best explanation for tides. In this study, we present a new theory (termed the oceanic basin oscillation-driving mechanism), in which tides are explained as a manifestation of oscillating ocean basin that is intricately linked to the elongated spinning solid Earth due to the Moon (Sun). Based on this new theory, we develop an algebraic tide model and test it using 11-year observations from 33 bottom pressure stations over the Pacific Ocean, the average Root Mean Square (RMS) deviation of tidal elevation predicted by this model against observation is 7.54 cm. Using a ratio of M2 elevation RMS of ocean tide model EOT11a and its total tidal elevation RMS as a reference, we estimate the total tidal elevation RMS of six purely hydrodynamic models (i.e.,Hallberg Isopycnal Model, OSU Tidal Inversion software-GN ,STORMTIDE model, OSU Tidal Inversion Software-ERB,STM-1B, and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model to be 59.93, 51.64, 57.05, 38.56, 86.92, and 53.56 cm, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Probabilistic, Spatiotemporally Coherent Downscaling of Climate Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>
