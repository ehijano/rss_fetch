      <title>A flux-based approach for analyzing the disguised toric locus of reaction networks</title>

Abstract: Dynamical systems with polynomial right-hand sides are very important in various applications, e.g., in biochemistry and population dynamics. The mathematical study of these dynamical systems is challenging due to the possibility of multistability, oscillations, and chaotic dynamics. One important tool for this study is the concept of reaction systems, which are dynamical systems generated by reaction networks for some choices of parameter values. Among these, disguised toric systems are remarkably stable: they have a unique attracting fixed point, and cannot give rise to oscillations or chaotic dynamics. The computation of the set of parameter values for which a network gives rise to disguised toric systems (i.e., the disguised toric locus of the network) is an important but difficult task. We introduce new ideas based on network fluxes for studying the disguised toric locus. We prove that the disguised toric locus of any network $G$ is a contractible manifold with boundary, and introduce an associated graph $G^{\max}$ that characterizes its interior. These theoretical tools allow us, for the first time, to compute the full disguised toric locus for many networks of interest.</description>

      <title>Relief of EGFR/FOS-downregulated miR-103a by loganin alleviates NF-kappaB-triggered inflammation and gut barrier disruption in colitis</title>

Abstract: Due to the ever-rising global incidence rate of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the lack of effective clinical treatment drugs, elucidating the detailed pathogenesis, seeking novel targets, and developing promising drugs are the top priority for IBD treatment. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of microRNA (miR)-103a were significantly downregulated in the inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, along with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta/TNF-alpha) and reduced tight junction protein (Occludin/ZO-1) levels, as compared with healthy control objects. Consistently, miR-103a deficient intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 showed serious inflammatory responses and increased permeability, and DSS induced more severe colitis in miR-103a-/- mice than wild-type ones. Mechanistic studies unraveled that c-FOS suppressed miR-103a transcription via binding to its promoter, then miR-103a-targeted NF-kappaB activation contributes to inflammatory responses and barrier disruption by targeting TAB2 and TAK1. Notably, the traditional Chinese medicine Cornus officinalis (CO) and its core active ingredient loganin potently mitigated inflammation and barrier disruption in UC by specifically blocking the EGFR/RAS/ERK/c-FOS signaling axis, these effects mainly attributed to modulated miR-103a levels as the therapeutic activities of them were almost completely shielded in miR-103a KO mice. Taken together, this work reveals that loganin relieves EGFR/c-FOS axis-suppressed epithelial miR-103a expression, thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation, suppressing inflammatory responses, and preserving tight junction integrity in UC. Thus, our data enrich mechanistic insights and promising targets for UC treatment.</description>

      <title>Robust multicellular programs dissect the complex tumor microenvironment and track disease progression in colorectal adenocarcinomas</title>

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, with five-year survival rates dropping from $\sim$90% in localized disease to $\sim$15% with distant metastases. Disease progression is shaped not only by tumor-intrinsic alterations but also by the reorganization of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Metabolic, compositional, and spatial changes contribute to this progression, but considered individually they lack context and often fail as therapeutic targets. Understanding their coordination could reveal processes to alter the disease course. Here, we combined multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) with machine learning to profile metabolic, functional and spatial states of 522 colorectal lesions with single-cell resolution. We observed recurrent stage-specific remodeling marked by a lymphoid-to-myeloid shift, stromal-cancer cooperation, and malignant metabolic shifts. Spatial organization of epithelial, stromal, and immune compartments provided stronger stratification of disease stage than tumor-intrinsic changes or bulk immune infiltration alone. To systematically model these coordinated changes, we condensed multimodal features into 10 latent factors of TME organization. These factors tracked disease progression, were conserved across cohorts, and revealed frequent multicellular metabolic niches and distinct, non-exclusive TME trajectories. Our framework MuVIcell exposes the elements that together drive CRC progression by grouping co-occurring changes across cell types and feature classes into coordinated multicellular programs. This creates a rational basis to therapeutically target TME reorganization. Importantly, the framework is scalable and flexible, offering a resource for studying multicellular organization in other solid tumors.</description>
