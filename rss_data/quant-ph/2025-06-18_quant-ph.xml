      <title>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation using controlled dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical constraints in many-body quantum systems can lead to Hilbert space fragmentation, wherein the system's evolution is restricted to small subspaces of Hilbert space called Krylov sectors. However, unitary dynamics within individual sectors may also be slow or non-ergodic, which limits experiments' ability to measure the properties of the entire sector. We show that additional controlled dephasing reliably mixes the system within a single Krylov sector, and that simple observables can differentiate these sectors. For example, in the strongly interacting XXZ chain with dephasing, the spin imbalance between even and odd sublattices distinguishes sectors. For appropriate choices of initial states, the imbalance begins positive, decays to a negative minimum value at intermediate times, and eventually returns to zero. The minimum reflects the average imbalance of the Krylov sector associated to the initial state. We compute the size of the minimum analytically in the limit of strong interactions, and validate our results with simulations at experimentally relevant interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave imprints on spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing interest, there is a scarcity of known predictions in the regime where both quantum and relativistic effects become observable. Here, we investigate a combined atom-field system in a curved spacetime, focusing specifically on gravitational-wave backgrounds. We show that a plane gravitational wave modifies spontaneous emission from a single atom, both in terms of sidebands in the spectrum and directionality of the emission. While the total decay rate remains unchanged, implying that no information about the gravitational wave is stored in the atomic internal state alone, the wave leaves imprints on the evolution of the composite atom-field system. To quantify how well this effect can be measured, we analyze both the classical Fisher information associated with photon number measurements and the quantum Fisher information. Our analysis indicates that the effect could be measured in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments and points to spontaneous emission as a potential probe of low-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transition with divergent multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium quench dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model in both integrable and nonintegrable regimes. In particular, we report on a novel type of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that is characterized by a divergent multipartite entanglement at critical times in the post-quench dynamics. We quantify the multipartite entanglement of the state by the quantum Fisher information and demonstrate that the DQPT belongs to a different universality class than the ground-state phase transition. Furthermore, we perform a spectral analysis of the DQPT and demonstrate that it is a genuine nonequilibrium transition arising from the constructive interference of excited states of the system during the many-body dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential experimental realizations in Rydberg platforms as well as applications in the context of quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Detecting zero-point fluctuations with stochastic Brownian oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality quantum oscillators are preferred over for precision sensing of external physical parameter because if the noise level due to interactions with the environment is too high, metrological information can be lost due to quantum decoherence. On the other hand, stronger interactions with a thermal environment could be seen a resource for new types of metrological schemes. We present a general amplification strategy that enables the detection zero-point fluctuations using low-quality quantum oscillators at finite temperature. We show that by injecting a controllable level of multiplicative frequency noise in a Brownian oscillator, quantum deviations from the virial theorem can be amplified by a parameter proportional to the strength of the frequency noise at constant temperature. As an application, we suggest a scheme in which the virial ratio is used as a witness of the quantum fluctuations of an unknown thermal bath, either by measuring the oscillator energy or the heat current flowing into an ancilla bath. Our work expands the metrological capacity of low-quality oscillators and can enable new measurements of the quantum properties of thermal environments by sensing their zero-point contributions to system variables.</description>

      <title>Fully Quantum Computational Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information theory, particularly its entropic formulations, has made remarkable strides in characterizing quantum systems and tasks. However, a critical dimension remains underexplored: computational efficiency. While classical computational entropies integrate complexity and feasibility into information measures, analogous concepts have yet to be rigorously developed in the quantum setting. In this work, we lay the basis for a new quantum computational information theory. Such a theory will allow studying efficient -- thus relevant in practice -- manipulation of quantum information. We introduce two innovative entropies: quantum computational min- and max-entropies (along with their smooth variants). Our quantum computational min-entropy is both the fully quantum counterpart of the classical unpredictability entropy, as well as the computational parallel to the quantum min-entropy. We establish a series of essential properties for this new entropy, including data processing and a chain rule. The quantum computational max-entropy is defined via a duality relation and gains operational meaning through an alternative formulation that we derive. Notably, it captures the efficiency of entanglement distillation with the environment, restricted to local quantum circuits of bounded size. With the introduction of our computational entropies and their study, this work marks a critical step toward a quantum information theory that incorporates computational elements.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Few Qubit Systems for Superconducting Hardware Compatibility and Circuit Design Sensitivity in Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current quantum computing ecosystem, building complex and integrated circuits for addressing real-world problems often involves using basic historical components like Bell states to take advantage of superposition, entanglement, and coherence. The availability of the simulator and the IBM quantum computing endeavor through Qiskit further broadens the scope of application based on domain use. In the NISQ era, however, error mitigation is a criterion that is applied when comparing a QPU run result with the simulator. As the real-world scope of application for quantum computing is being broadened, using simulators as a baseline offers confidence; however, concerns about computation resources and availability arise in the high-speed computational regime. As complex problems entail using a larger number of superconducting physical qubits, what should be the basis of framing a quantum circuit for building quantum algorithms in a real-world scenario, given hardware compatibility that should ideally provide confidence baselining with the simulator outcome? This work implements three base circuits for different qubit systems in the simulator and corresponding 127-qubit IBM Sherbrooke superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) to explore the tradeoff between generalizability, sensitivity of circuit design to parameters, noise resilience, resource planning, and efficient qubit usage insights.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Platform for Multiomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of biological systems, governed by molecular interactions across hierarchical scales, presents a challenge for computational modeling. While advances in multiomic profiling have enabled precise measurements of biological components, classical computational approaches remain limited in capturing emergent dynamics critical for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. Quantum computing offers a new paradigm for addressing classically intractable problems, yet its integration into biological research remains nascent due to scalability barriers and accessibility gaps. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning platform designed to bridge this gap, with an encode-search-build approach which allows for efficiently extracting the most relevant information from biological data to \underline{encode} into a quantum state, provably efficient training algorithms to \underline{search} for optimal parameters, and a stacking strategy that allows one to systematically \underline{build} more complex models as more quantum resources become available. We propose to demonstrate the platform's utility through two initial use cases: quantum-enhanced classification of phenotypic states from molecular variables and prediction of temporal evolution in biological systems.</description>

      <title>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can, on average, enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally, but since we allow for classical communication between the two modes, we consider a scheme involving local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Under these considerations, we show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible conditional states, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. In other words, prior state engineering via partial measurement does not improve the average discrimination performance.</description>

      <title>Entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors amplify quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the quantum coherence between a pair of entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, interacting with a quantum field, using a nonperturbative approach in a (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with instantaneous switching ($\delta$-switching). It is intriguing to observe that for a maximally entangled state, increasing the coupling strength enhances the detectors' initial quantum coherence while simultaneously causing a monotonic decrease in their initial entanglement. This reveals a remarkable phenomenon: through nonperturbative interactions, entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors can exhibit a dual effect-amplifying quantum coherence while degrading quantum entanglement. This finding stands in stark contrast to previous studies based on perturbative methods or Gaussian switching functions, which generally concluded that interactions between detectors and the field lead to a simultaneous degradation of quantum coherence and entanglement due to environmental decoherence. Notably, while initially separable detectors successfully harvest quantum coherence from the vacuum, entanglement extraction remains fundamentally prohibited. These contrasting behaviors underscore the fundamental distinction between coherence and entanglement as quantum resources, and highlight their complementary roles in field-detector interactions.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hybrid-Mode Coupler Enabling Strong Interactions between Transmons at Centimeter-Scale Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transmon, a fabrication-friendly superconducting qubit, remains a leading candidate for scalable quantum computing. Recent advances in tunable couplers have accelerated progress toward high-performance quantum processors. However, extending coherent interactions beyond millimeter scales to enhance quantum connectivity presents a critical challenge. Here, we introduce a hybrid-mode coupler exploiting resonator-transmon hybridization to simultaneously engineer the two lowest-frequency mode, enabling high-contrast coupling between centimeter-scale transmons. For a 1-cm coupler, our framework predicts flux-tunable $XX$ and $ZZ$ coupling strengths reaching 23 MHz and 100 MHz, with modulation contrasts exceeding $10^2$ and $10^4$, respectively, demonstrating quantitative agreement with an effective two-channel model. This work provides an efficient pathway to mitigate the inherent connectivity constraints imposed by short-range interactions, enabling transmon-based architectures compatible with hardware-efficient quantum tasks.</description>

      <title>Spin Correlations in Recirculating Multipass Alkali Cells for Advancing Quantum Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipass cells are critical components in a variety of quantum technologies, including atomic magnetometers and optical quantum memories, due to their ability to achieve long optical paths within compact volumes. In optical magnetometry, increasing the optical depth through multipass geometries enhances sensitivity by reducing photon shot noise and enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) detection. In this work, we present a novel recirculating multipass alkali cell that improves the active-to-cell volume ratio and minimizes beam spot overlap, thereby addressing spin noise limitations inherent in conventional cylindrical Herriott cavity designs. We develop and validate an analytical model based on the ABCD matrix method to predict beam spot positions, sizes, and astigmatism effects, with results confirmed through Zemax simulations. In addition, we introduce a general analytical model for analyzing spin correlation noise in multipass alkali cells, incorporating both astigmatism and spatial intensity distribution-features not addressed in existing models. By deriving the spin noise time-correlation function and spectrum, we reveal how power intensity profiles contribute to spin diffusion noise. Our analysis demonstrates that the recirculating cell offers improved beam coverage, reduced spot overlap, and enhanced spin correlation-particularly when using concave mirrors with longer focal lengths. Furthermore, we show that avoiding tightly focused, high-intensity regions can significantly suppress spin diffusion noise. These findings establish the recirculating cell design as a practical and high-performance solution for advancing the precision of atomic sensors and other multipass cavity-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of high-fidelity logical magic states from code switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparation of high-fidelity logical magic states has remained as a necessary but daunting step towards building a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. One approach is to fault-tolerantly prepare a magic state in one code and then switch to another, a method known as code switching. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol on an ion-trap quantum processor, yielding a logical magic state encoded in an error-correcting code with state-of-the-art logical fidelity. Our experiment is based on the first demonstration of code-switching between color codes, from the fifteen-qubit quantum Reed-Muller code to the seven-qubit Steane code. We prepare an encoded magic state in the Steane code with $82.58\%$ probability, with an infidelity of at most $5.1(2.7) \times 10^{-4}$. The reported infidelity is lower than the leading infidelity of the physical operations utilized in the protocol by a factor of at least $2.7$, indicating the quantum processor is below the pseudo-threshold. Furthermore, we create two copies of the magic state in the same quantum processor and perform a logical Bell basis measurement for a sample-efficient certification of the encoded magic state. The high-fidelity magic state can be combined with the already-demonstrated fault-tolerant Clifford gates, state preparation, and measurement of the 2D color code, completing a universal set of fault-tolerant computational primitives with logical error rates equal or better than the physical two-qubit error rate.</description>

      <title>Norm Inequality for Perturbed Quantum Evolutions and Its Application to Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of coherent control errors on quantum state evolution by deriving a general norm inequality based on Gronwall's lemma. This inequality provides an explicit upper bound on the deviation between an ideal quantum state and one subject to arbitrary coherent perturbations, including both time-dependent and time-independent cases. The framework is broadly applicable, requiring no assumptions about the detailed structure of the perturbation and full dynamics of the quantum system. We apply this approach to analyze the robustness of Grover's search algorithm in the presence of coherent errors. Our results characterizes quantitative scaling relations between the error strength, algorithm runtime, and success probability, offering practical guidelines for the design of resilient quantum protocols. We further compare the effects of time-dependent and time-independent perturbations, showing the distinctive ways in which coherent errors accumulate in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Graph Shrinking for Quantum Optimization of Constrained Combinatorial Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of quantum algorithms, especially those leveraging variational parameterization and circuit-based optimization, are being studied as alternatives for solving classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, their applicability is limited by hardware constraints, including shallow circuit depth, limited qubit counts, and noise. To mitigate these issues, we propose a hybrid classical--quantum framework based on graph shrinking to reduce the number of variables and constraints in QUBO formulations of COPs, while preserving problem structure.
  Our approach introduces three key ideas: (i) constraint-aware shrinking that prevents merges that will likely violate problem-specific feasibility constraints, (ii) a verification-and-repair pipeline to correct infeasible solutions post-optimization, and (iii) adaptive strategies for recalculating correlations and controlling the graph shrinking process. We apply our approach to three standard benchmark problems: Multidimensional Knapsack (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
  Empirical results show that our approach improves solution feasibility, reduces repair complexity, and enhances quantum optimization quality on hardware-limited instances. These findings demonstrate a scalable pathway for applying near-term quantum algorithms to classically challenging constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>One Polynomial Strategy for Computing Local Projections on Square-Lattice Cluster States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. It is one of the promising candidates for the next-generation computing paradigms. Basically, there are two technical lines to realize quantum computing. One is composing the unitary operators of a few qubits to achieve general unitary operators on an arbitrary number of qubits, known as the approach of quantum circuits. The other one focuses on preparing quantum cluster states and performing the computation by measuring the states with a particular basis, known as measurement-based quantum computing or one-way quantum computing. The two strategies have been proven to be equivalent to each other. This note aims to discuss the strategies for computing the local projections on square-lattice cluster states. Seemingly, one strategy for the computation could require both polynomial steps and memories. In particular, if the number of qubits in a square-lattice is denoted by $N$, the step number for computing an arbitrary local projection on the state could be proportional to a polynomial of $N$ under a bounded cost of memory. Consider that the square-lattice cluster states are one kind of universal computing resource, the results might be helpful for understanding the computational advantages of quantum algorithms, as well as the limits of the numerical analysis on other relevant quantum models. Although the results in the note are not peer reviewed, we would like to make them public because they are quite easy to check.</description>

      <title>Certifying spatial entanglement between non-degenerate photon pairs with a camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate transverse spatial entanglement between photon pairs of different wavelengths using a camera-based coincidence technique. By adapting the correlation measurements to the photons frequencies, we certify the presence of entanglement between the pairs through violation of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion. Additionally, we examine how parameters such as pump waist and crystal length influence these correlations. Our results highlight key differences from the frequency-degenerate case, showing that an adapted theoretical analysis is essential to avoid significant misestimations and to reliably certify entanglement.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Mixed-Species Entanglement over a Quantum Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate multipartite entangled states of two, three and four matter qubits, where the entanglement is distributed over macroscopic distances via a photonic network link. Trapped-ion ${}^{88}\text{Sr}^+$ qubits are entangled directly via the optical fibre link, and the entanglement is subsequently extended to ${}^{43}\text{Ca}^+$ memory qubits co-trapped in each network node, using local mixed-species logic gates. We create remotely entangled $\text{Sr}^+$-$\text{Ca}^+$ and $\text{Ca}^+$-$\text{Ca}^+$ states, as well as mixed-species Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of up to four qubits. We demonstrate storage of the remotely-entangled memory qubits for $\sim10~\text{s}$, more than $100\times$ the creation time.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent single- and double-quantum relaxation of negatively charged boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising candidate for quantum sensing. The coherence time of this defect spins which coherent quantum sensing resides in is limited spin-phonon interactions, while the underlying physical mechanism of the corresponding high-temperature behavior is still not fully understood. Here, we probe the single- and double-quantum relaxation rates on this center over the temperature range from 293 to 393 K. The results show that both relaxation rates increase with increasing temperature, and the double-quantum relaxation rate significantly increases rapidly. At high temperature (above 400 K), the double-quantum relaxation rate is much greater than single-quantum relaxation rate, and may dominate the decoherence channel of spin-phonon interactions. Using a theoretical model of second-order spin-phonon interactions, we attribute the high-temperature spin relaxation rates to interactions with higher-energy effective phonon mode, aiding the further understanding and guiding high-temperature sensing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of AGI instantiated on quantum substrates motivates the development of mathematical frameworks that enable direct comparison of their operation in classical and quantum environments. To this end, we introduce a Hamiltonian formalism for describing classical and quantum AGI tasks as a means of contrasting their interaction with the environment. We propose a decomposition of AGI dynamics into Hamiltonian generators for core functions such as induction, reasoning, recursion, learning, measurement, and memory. This formalism aims to contribute to the development of a precise mathematical language for how quantum and classical agents differ via environmental interaction.</description>

      <title>Macroscopicity of quantum superposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a universal measure of macroscopicity $\beta$ in the form of, ({\em experimentally observed coherence time})/({\em characteristic time required to repeatably distinguish the components of a quantum superposition state}), to divide the quantum/classical (Q-C) boundary. The analysis shows that, for a matter-wave interferometer, covering systems from electron to macromolecular, the measure of its macroscopicity is expressed by $\beta=p\theta d/8\hbar$, and it consistently yields $\beta&lt;1$ by investigating the coherence data reported in the literature. The result implies that limited advancement has been made toward exploring the Q-C boundary in such experiments. Additionally, for a Ramsey-like interferometer, the measure of its macroscopicity is expressed as $\beta=8\pi^3\alpha\nu_0r_s^2\nu_s^2T/ (9c^2)$. After analyzing the reported experimental data, we find that a maximum value of $\beta \sim 300$ is achieved in the vertical atomic fountain experiments. Therefore, searching the Q-C boundary in the atomic fountain may be a more proper direction.</description>

      <title>Annihilating and breaking Lorentz cone entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear maps between finite-dimensional ordered vector spaces with orders induced by proper cones $C_A$ and $C_B$ are called entanglement breaking if their partial application sends the maximal tensor product $K\otimes_{\max} C_A$ into the minimal tensor product $K\otimes_{\min} C_B$ for any proper cone $K$. We study the larger class of Lorentz-entanglement breaking maps where $K$ is restricted to be a Lorentz cone of any dimension, i.e., any cone over a Euclidean ball. This class of maps appeared recently in the study of asymptotic entanglement annihilation and it is dual to the linear maps factoring through Lorentz cones. Our main results establish connections between these classes of maps and operator ideals studied in the theory of Banach spaces. For operators $u:X\rightarrow Y$ between finite-dimensional normed spaces $X$ and $Y$ we consider so-called central maps which are positive with respect to the cones $C_A=C_X$ and $C_B=C_Y$. We show how to characterize when such a map factors through a Lorentz cone and when it is Lorentz-entanglement breaking by using the Hilbert-space factorization norm $\gamma_2$ and its dual $\gamma^*_2$. We also study the class of Lorentz-entanglement annihilating maps whose local application sends the Lorentzian tensor product $C_A\otimes_{L} C_A$ into the minimal tensor product $C_B\otimes_{\min} C_B$. When $C_A$ is a cone over a finite-dimensional normed space and $C_B$ is a Lorentz cone itself, the central maps of this kind can be characterized by the $2$-summing norm $\pi_2$. Finally, we prove interesting connections between these classes of maps for general cones, and we identify examples with particular properties, e.g., cones with an analogue of the $2$-summing property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider several definitions of the quantum Wasserstein distance based on an optimization over general bipartite quantum states with given marginals. Then, we examine the quantities obtained after the optimization is carried out over bipartite separable states instead. We prove that several of these quantities are equal to each other. Thus, we connect several approaches in the literature. As a byproduct, we show that the Uhlmann-Jozsa quantum fidelity can also be written as an optimization over separable states with given marginals.</description>

      <title>Certified randomness from quantum speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits are usually regarded as fundamental restrictions, constraining the amount of computation that can be achieved within some given time and energy. Complementary to this intuition, here we show that these limitations are also of operational value: they enable the secure generation of certified randomness. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario with some (experimentally determined or promised) upper bound on the energy uncertainty of the average prepared quantum state, but without any further assumptions on the devices, Hilbert space or Hamiltonian. Given that we can freely choose the time at which to apply the untrusted preparation procedure, we show that this scenario admits the generation of randomness that is secure against adversaries with additional classical information. We show how to determine the amount of certified randomness given the observed correlations, discuss how interactions with the environment are taken into account, and sketch a conceivable experimental implementation. Remarkably, even single-mode coherent states admit this kind of certification of non-zero randomness in some parameter regimes, reinforcing ongoing approaches to demonstrate versions of nonclassicality in the simple harmonic oscillator. Our results extend existing efforts to devise semi-device-independent protocols grounded in reasonable physical assumptions, and they contribute to the understanding of time-energy uncertainty relations via their operational consequences.</description>

      <title>Topological Contextuality and Quantum Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality, a fundamental feature distinguishing quantum theory from classical models, is investigated via algebraic and topological structures inherent in modular tensor categories. This work rigorously demonstrates that braid group representations induced by modular categories, particularly those associated with SU(2) at level k and Fibonacci anyon models, exhibit state-dependent contextuality characterized by violations of noncontextuality inequalities. By explicitly constructing these unitary representations on fusion spaces, the study establishes a direct correspondence between braiding operations and logical contextuality scenarios. The results offer a comprehensive topological framework to classify and quantify contextuality in low-dimensional quantum systems, elucidating its role as a resource in topological quantum computation and advancing the interface between quantum algebra, topology, and quantum foundations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconducting quantum circuits, airbridges are critical for eliminating parasitic slotline modes of coplanar waveguide circuits and reducing crosstalks between direct current magnetic flux biases. Here, we present a technique for fabricating superconducting airbridges. With this technique, a single layer of photoresist is employed, and the gradient exposure process is used to define the profile of airbridges. In order to properly obtain the bridge profile, we design exposure dosage based on residual photoresist thickness and laser power calibrations. Compared with other airbridge fabrication techniques, the gradient exposure fabrication technique provides the ability to produce lossless superconducting airbridges with flexible size and, thus, is more suitable for large-scale superconducting quantum circuits. Furthermore, this method reduces the complexity of the fabrication process and provides a high fabrication yield.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian state preparation and enhancement using weak-value amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol for generating a broad class of non-Gaussian (nG) quantum states via postselected weak measurement techniques. The scheme involves injecting an arbitrary quantum state and a single photon into the signal and idler ports, respectively, of an interference setup that incorporates a third-order nonlinear medium. A nG state is conditionally produced at the signal output, heralded by the detection of a single photon in one of the idler output channels. The protocol exploits a weak cross-Kerr interaction and effective single-photon nonlinearity enhanced by the weak-value amplification. We show that by tuning the weak value of the photon number operator in the idler mode within experimentally feasible parameters, a wide variety of nG states can be generated with high fidelity. As specific examples, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added states, displaced and squeezed number states, and a continuum of intermediate nG states using coherent and squeezed vacuum inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the protocol enables the enhancement of non-Gaussianity and the enlargement of Schr\"odinger cat (SC) states when ideal SC states are used as the input. Our results provide an alternative route for the conditional generation of tunable nG states, with potential applications in quantum information processing. This approach may also open new avenues for quantum state engineering using postselected weak measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Dressed States of a Quantum Four-Level System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally and theoretically study the dressed-state emission of the biexciton-exciton cascade in a semiconductor quantum dot under pulsed, resonant, two-photon excitation. Building on the well-characterized steady-state dressed emission of the four-level system, we examine its dynamic counterpart under pulsed, resonant excitation, addressing both experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Here we report several sidebands emerging from the biexciton-to-exciton transition, whose number and spectral width depend on the excitation pulse duration and the effective pulse area, while no sidebands emerge from the exciton-to-ground-state transition. Since the biexciton state population follows a nonlinear pulse area function, sidebands with a small spectral nonlinearity result. Detuning- and time-dependent measurements provide deeper insight into the emission properties of the dressed states. They show that side peak emission only occurs in the presence of the excitation pulse. Moreover, when the system is excited by a Gaussian-shaped laser pulse, side peak emission takes place sequentially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband quantum-limited amplifiers are essential for quantum information processing, yet challenges in design and fabrication continue to hinder their widespread applications. Here, we introduce the broadband merged-element Josephson parametric amplifier in which the discrete parallel capacitor is directly integrated with the Josephson junctions. This merged-element design eliminates the shortcomings of discrete capacitors, simplifying the fabrication process, reducing the need for high-precision lithography tools, and ensuring compatibility with standard superconducting qubit fabrication procedures. Experimental results demonstrate a gain of 15 dB over a 500 MHz bandwidth, a mean saturation power of -116 dBm and near-quantum-limited noise performance. This robust readily implemented parametric amplifier holds significant promise for broader applications in superconducting quantum information and the advancement of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Approximating Hamiltonian for Hartree-Fock solutions for nonrelativistic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our work we construct a Hamiltonian, whose eigenstates approximate the solutions of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock equations for nonrelativistic atoms and ions. Its eigenvalues are given by completely algebraic expressions and the eigenfunctions are defined by Coulomb wave-functions orbitals. Within this approximation we compute the binding energy, ionization potentials, electron density distribution, electron density at the nucleus, and atomic scattering factors of nonrelativistic atoms and ions. The accuracy of our results is comparable with those obtained via the usage of the Hartree-Fock method but does not require solving integro-differential equations or numerically computing integrals with complex functions. This approach can serve as a good initial approximation for performing more accurate calculations and for the quantitative evaluation of physical parameters that depend on the electron density of atoms. The proposed approach is of interest for various fields of condensed matter physics, plasma physics and quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Breaking even with magic: demonstration of a high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information to protect it from errors is essential for performing large-scale quantum computations. Performing a universal set of quantum gates on encoded states demands a potentially large resource overhead and minimizing this overhead is key for the practical development of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers. We propose and experimentally implement a magic-state preparation protocol to fault-tolerantly prepare a pair of logical magic states in a [[6,2,2]] quantum error-detecting code using only eight physical qubits. Implementing this protocol on H1-1, a 20 qubit trapped-ion quantum processor, we prepare magic states with experimental infidelity $7^{+3}_{-1}\times 10^{-5}$ with a $14.8^{+1}_{-1}\%$ discard rate and use these to perform a fault-tolerant non-Clifford gate, the controlled-Hadamard (CH), with logical infidelity $\leq 2.3^{+9}_{-9}\times 10^{-4}$. Notably, this significantly outperforms the unencoded physical CH infidelity of $10^{-3}$. Through circuit-level stabilizer simulations, we show that this protocol can be self-concatenated to produce extremely high-fidelity magic states with low space-time overhead in a [[36,4,4]] quantum error correcting code, with logical error rates of $6\times 10^{-10}$ ($5\times 10^{-14}$) at two-qubit error rate of $10^{-3}$ ($10^{-4}$) respectively.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>

      <title>Relativistic implications of entropy and purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum object is extended by virtue of quantum uncertainty. Subjected to gravity, it therefore experiences tidal forces and other relativistic effects. As a result, entropy and purity affect geodesic motion and acquire weight, an observation that has broad implications from free-fall experiments to Hawking radiation. If the object's position is quantum correlated in at least two directions, a complete description of its geodesic motion requires non-Riemannian geometry of a form controlled by the entropy and purity of its state. In addition, the analysis reveals a new Minkowski structure on a subspace of entanglement degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Large effects from quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference frames are used to parameterize measurements of physical effects, but since their practical realization uses material objects, they may affect observations performed in a combined quantum state of the measured system together with the frame. Here, a procedure is used that makes it possible to describe non-monotonic reference scales in a quantum treatment, revealing large quantum effects in the measured system whenever a reference frame encounters a turning point. Subtle quantum correlations in the combined state of system and frame, and more broadly the concept of relational quantum mechanics, can be tested via a characteristic and surprisingly large shift in the measured value.</description>

      <title>Union-Intersection Union-Find for Decoding Depolarizing Errors in Topological Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Union-Intersection Union-Find (UIUF) algorithm for decoding depolarizing errors in topological codes, combining the strengths of iterative and standard Union-Find (UF) decoding. While iterative UF improves performance at moderate error rates, it lacks an error correction guarantee. To address this, we develop UIUF, which maintains the enhanced performance of iterative UF while ensuring error correction up to half the code distance. Through simulations under code capacity, phenomenological, and biased noise models, we show that UIUF significantly outperforms UF, reducing the logical error rate by over an order of magnitude (at around $10^{-5}$). Moreover, UIUF achieves lower logical error rates than the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder on rotated surface codes under both the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, while preserving efficient linear-time complexity.</description>

      <title>Belief propagation for networks with loops: The neighborhoods-intersections-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to diminish the damaging effect of loops on belief propagation (BP), the first explicit version of generalized BP for networks, the KCN-method, was recently introduced. Despite its success, the KCN-method spends computational resources inefficiently. Such inefficiencies can quickly turn the exact application of the method unfeasible, since its time complexity increases exponentially with them. This affects for instance tree networks, for which, despite not offering any accuracy advantage with respect to BP, the time complexity of the KCN-method grows exponentially with the nodes' degree. To avoid these issues, we introduce here a new generalized BP scheme, the NIB-method, which only spends computational resources provided they are needed in order to account for correlations in the network. In fact, we show that, given a network with only short loops, the NIB-method is exact and optimal, and we characterize its time complexity reduction with respect to the KCN-method. If long loops are also present, both methods become approximate. In this scenario, we discuss the relation between the methods and we show how to interpolate between them, obtaining a richer family of generalized BP algorithms that trade accuracy for complexity. Lastly, we find a good agreement between the (approximate) KCN and NIB methods when computing the partition function for two artificial networks.</description>

Abstract: Bose-Einstein Condensation is a phenomenon at the heart of many of the past century's most intriguing and fundamental manifestations, such as superfluidity and superconductivity. It was discovered theoretically some 100 years ago, and unequivocally experimentally demonstrated in the context of weakly interacting gases 30 years ago. Since then, it has spawned a revolution in our understanding of fundamental phases of matter and collective quantum dynamics extending across all physical scales and energies, with unforeseen implications and the potential for envisaged quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving Andreev spin qubits in germanium-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) are a promising platform for quantum information processing which benefit from both the small footprint of semiconducting spin qubits and the long range connectivity of superconducting qubits. While state-of-the-art experiments have developed ASQs in InAs nanowires, these realizations are coherence-time limited by nuclear magnetic noise which cannot be removed by isotopic purification. In Ge-based Josephson junctions, which can be isotopically purified, Andreev states have been experimentally observed but spin-resolved Andreev states remain elusive. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that the geometry of the Josephson junction can limit the qubit frequency to values below typical experimental temperatures and render the ASQ effectively invisible. ASQs could be experimentally resolved by judiciously choosing the geometry of the junction and filling of the underlying Ge. Our comprehensive study of ASQ frequency on in situ and ex situ experimentally controllable parameters provides design guidance of Ge-based Josephson junctions and paves the way towards realization of high-coherence ASQs.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Annealing Approach for Solving Optimal Feature Selection and Next Release Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search-based software engineering (SBSE) addresses critical optimization challenges in software engineering, including the next release problem (NRP) and feature selection problem (FSP). While traditional heuristic approaches and integer linear programming (ILP) methods have demonstrated efficacy for small to medium-scale problems, their scalability to large-scale instances remains unknown. Here, we introduce quantum annealing (QA) as a subroutine to tackling multi-objective SBSE problems, leveraging the computational potential of quantum systems. We propose two QA-based algorithms tailored to different problem scales. For small-scale problems, we reformulate multi-objective optimization (MOO) as single-objective optimization (SOO) using penalty-based mappings for quantum processing. For large-scale problems, we employ a decomposition strategy guided by maximum energy impact (MEI), integrating QA with a steepest descent method to enhance local search efficiency. Applied to NRP and FSP, our approaches are benchmarked against the heuristic NSGA-II and the ILP-based $\epsilon$-constraint method. Experimental results reveal that while our methods produce fewer non-dominated solutions than $\epsilon$-constraint, they achieve significant reductions in execution time. Moreover, compared to NSGA-II, our methods deliver more non-dominated solutions with superior computational efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of QA in advancing scalable and efficient solutions for SBSE challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of quantum randomness into Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) using the Ed25519 elliptic curve to strengthen cryptographic security. By replacing traditional pseudorandom number generators with quantum entropy sources, we assess the impact on key security and performance metrics, including execution time, and resource usage. Our approach simulates a modified VRF setup where initialization keys are derived from a quantum random number generator source (QRNG). The results show that while QRNGs could enhance the unpredictability and verifiability of VRFs, their incorporation introduces challenges related to temporal and computational overhead. This study provides valuable insights into the trade-offs of leveraging quantum randomness in API-driven cryptographic systems and offers a potential path toward more secure and efficient protocol design. The QRNG-based system shows increased (key generation times from 50 to 400+ microseconds, verification times from 500 to 3500 microseconds) and higher CPU usage (17% to 30%) compared to the more consistent performance of a Go-based VRF (key generation times below 200 microseconds, verification times under 2000 microseconds, CPU usage below 10%), highlighting trade-offs in computational efficiency and resource demands.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase diagram of the Quantum Ising model with Cluster Interaction Under Noisy and Noiseless Driven field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</description>

      <title>Disorder-Engineered Hybrid Plasmonic Cavities for Emission Control of Defects in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect-based quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising building blocks for scalable quantum photonics due to their stable single-photon emission at room temperature. However, enhancing their emission intensity and controlling the decay dynamics remain significant challenges. This study demonstrates a low-cost, scalable fabrication approach to integrate plasmonic nanocavities with defect-based quantum emitters in hBN nanoflakes. Using the thermal dewetting process, we realize two distinct configurations: stochastic Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) on hBN flakes and hybrid plasmonic nanocavities formed by AgNPs on top of hBN flakes supported on gold/silicon dioxide (Au/SiO2) substrates. While AgNPs on bare hBN yield up to a two-fold photoluminescence (PL) enhancement with reduced emitter lifetimes, the hybrid nanocavity architecture provides a dramatic, up to 100-fold PL enhancement and improved uniformity across multiple. emitters, all without requiring deterministic positioning. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and time-resolved PL measurements confirm size-dependent control over decay dynamics and cavity-emitter interactions. Our versatile solution overcomes key quantum photonic device development challenges, including material integration, emission intensity optimization, and spectral multiplexity. Future work will explore potential applications in integrated photonic circuits hosting on-chip quantum systems and hBN-based label-free single-molecule detection through such quantum nanoantennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) cooling is a well-established method for preparing trapped ion systems in their motional ground state. However, isolating a three-level system, as required for EIT cooling, is often challenging or impractical. In this work, we extend the EIT cooling framework to multilevel systems where the number of ground states exceeds the number of excited states, ensuring the presence of at least one dark state. We develop a formalism to accurately determine the cooling rate in the weak sideband coupling regime and provide an approximate estimate for cooling rates beyond this regime, without the need for explicit simulation of the motional degree of freedom. We clarify the connection between the cooling rate and the absorption spectrum, offering a pathway for efficient near-ground-state cooling of ions with complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. This revealed, for instance, the surprising 'quantum Mpemba effect' that occurs when a symmetry is restored more rapidly when the initial configuration is less symmetric. While the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, however, the one of spatial symmetries has only been considered recently in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. Specifically, we consider non-interacting spinless fermions on the lattice prepared in non-equilibrium states invariant only under $\nu&gt;1$ lattice shifts and follow the restoration of one-site shift invariance. We do so by measuring the Frobenius distance between the state on a subsystem, and its symmetrised counterpart. We compute the latter exactly, using standard Gaussian methods, and formulate a quasiparticle picture -- involving multiplets of $\nu$ correlated quasiparticles -- to describe analytically its asymptotic behaviour. We show that, differently from random unitary circuits where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, here symmetry is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. Interestingly, we also show that, in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries, the quasiparticle picture does not provide a quantitative description of discrete translation symmetry restoration and that the latter process goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can directly be extended to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted tracer dispersion in turbulent shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum-assisted generative algorithm for synthetic tracks of Lagrangian tracer particles in a turbulent shear flow. The parallelism and sampling properties of quantum algorithms are used to build and optimize a parametric quantum circuit, which generates a quantum state that corresponds to the joint probability density function of the classical turbulent velocity components, p(u_1^{\prime}, u_2^{\prime}, u_3^{\prime}). Velocity samples are drawn by one-shot measurements on the quantum circuit. The hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is validated with two classical methods, a standard stochastic Lagrangian model and a classical sampling scheme in the form of a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. We consider a homogeneous turbulent shear flow with a constant shear rate S as a proof of concept for which the velocity fluctuations are Gaussian. The generation of the joint probability density function is also tested on a real quantum device, the 20-qubit IQM Resonance quantum computing platform for cases of up to 10 qubits. Our study paves the way to applications of Lagrangian small-scale parameterizations of turbulent transport in complex turbulent flows by quantum computers.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity collisional quantum gates with fermionic atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of electronic structure and strongly correlated quantum phases are widely regarded as among the most promising applications of quantum computing. These simulations require the accurate implementation of motion and entanglement of fermionic particles. Instead of the commonly applied costly mapping to qubits, fermionic quantum computers offer the prospect of directly implementing electronic structure problems. Ultracold neutral atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for spin-based quantum computing, but quantum information can also be processed via the motion of bosonic or fermionic atoms offering a distinct advantage by intrinsically conserving crucial symmetries like electron number. Here we demonstrate collisional entangling gates with fidelities up to 99.75(6)% and lifetimes of Bell states beyond $10\,s$ via the control of fermionic atoms in an optical superlattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we characterize both spin-exchange and pair-tunneling gates locally, and realize a robust, composite pair-exchange gate, a key building block for quantum chemistry simulations. Our results enable the preparation of complex quantum states and advanced readout protocols for a new class of scalable analog-digital hybrid quantum simulators. Once combined with local addressing, they mark a key step towards a fully digital fermionic quantum computer based on the controlled motion and entanglement of fermionic neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity quantum state control of a polar molecular ion in a cryogenic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) protocol to control the quantum state of a CaH+ ion in a cryogenic environment, in which reduced thermal radiation extends rotational state lifetimes by an order of magnitude over those at room temperature. By repeatedly and adaptively probing the molecule, detecting the outcome of each probe via an atomic ion, and using a Bayesian update scheme to quantify confidence in the molecular state, we demonstrate state preparation and measurement (SPAM) in a single quantum state with infidelity less than $6\times10^{-3}$ and measure Rabi flopping between two states with greater than 99% contrast. The protocol does not require any molecule-specific lasers and the detection scheme is non-destructive. To our knowledge, this result represents the highest SPAM fidelity of a single molecular quantum state demonstrated to date.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of fermionic non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in $(2+1)$D with built-in gauge protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in the field of quantum simulation have significantly expanded the potential for applications, particularly in the context of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Maintaining gauge invariance throughout a simulation remains a central challenge, especially for large-scale non-Abelian LGTs with dynamical matter, which are particularly complex in terms of engineering for experiments. Gauge-symmetry breaking is inevitable in established rishon-based schemes for alkaline-earth-like atoms (AELAs) and controlling the magnitude of its effect is an open challenge. Here, we first construct a minimal model to quantum simulate non-Abelian LGTs ensuring that the gauge constraints are met and explicitly derive their unambiguous non-Abelian nature. Second, we present a proposal for a novel gauge protection scheme using native interactions in AELAs enabling the simulation of toy models of non-Abelian $U(2)$ LGTs with dynamical fermionic matter in $(2+1)$ dimensions on large scales. Due to the simplicity of the gauge protection mechanism, based on a Zeeman shift in combination with superexchange interactions, our scheme can be naturally included in other rishon-based quantum simulation protocols. Third, we extend our approach to a fully scalable, hybrid digital-analog simulator for $U(N)$ LGTs based on Rydberg AELA with variable rishon number. The proposed general mechanism for gauge protection provides a promising path towards the long-awaited simulation of non-Abelian LGTs relevant to particle physics.</description>

Abstract: Irreversibility between preparation and discrimination processes is manifested in the indistinguishability of orthogonal product states via local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Characterizing quantum properties for sets of states according to their local distinguishing property is one of the avenues to explain the surprising results obtained in the LOCC indistinguishability domain. We propose a measure based on the $l_1$ norm of coherence to quantitatively assess the quantumness of ensembles composed of orthogonal product states. Furthermore, to establish a hierarchy among different product ensembles, we establish a relationship between the coherence-based measure of an ensemble and the optimal success probability of distinguishing states within the ensemble using LOCC, constrained by a limited amount of classical communication and projective measurements, in the framework of minimum error state discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14344v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a scenario of bipartite steering with local subsystems of the parties modeled by certain operator algebras. In particular, we formalize the notion of quantum assemblages in a commuting observables paradigm and focus on equivalent descriptions of such objects providing a systematic analysis of previously scattered approaches. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of quantum commuting and tensor models that is stable under extensions of the trusted subsystem by arbitrary finite-dimensional ancillae. As a result, we show that the gap between two models of bipartite steering can be observed in an arbitrary scenario with two measurement settings ($m = 2$) and more than two outcomes ($k &gt; 2$). Finally, we provide no-go results concerning the possibility of post-quantum steering in this most general bipartite paradigm and discuss related corollaries regarding free probability and operator system approach as well as a link to Tsirelson's problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum illumination leverages entangled lights to detect the presence of low-reflectivity objects within a thermal environment. In a related vein, quantum parameter estimation utilizes nonclassical probes to precisely determine unknown system parameters. Although both fields have been studied extensively, their performances have traditionally been assessed using different figures of merit: signal-to-noise ratio for QI and quantum Fisher information for parameter estimation. In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic connection between these two measures in the context of target detection, thereby providing explicit operational criteria for identifying optimal measurements. We further apply this relationship to various target detection protocols that employ exotic non-Gaussian states derived from coherent states and two-mode squeezed vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Modular quantum signal processing in many variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in quantum algorithms, quantum programs in practice are often expressed at the circuit level, forgoing helpful structural abstractions common to their classical counterparts. Consequently, as many quantum algorithms have been unified with the advent of quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), an opportunity has appeared to cast these algorithms as modules that can be combined to constitute complex programs. Complicating this, however, is that while QSP/QSVT are often described by the polynomial transforms they apply to the singular values of large linear operators, and the algebraic manipulation of polynomials is simple, the QSP/QSVT protocols realizing analogous manipulations of their embedded polynomials are non-obvious. Here we provide a theory of modular multi-input-output QSP-based superoperators, the basic unit of which we call a gadget, and show they can be snapped together with LEGO-like ease at the level of the functions they apply. To demonstrate this ease, we also provide a Python package for assembling gadgets and compiling them to circuits. Viewed alternately, gadgets both enable the efficient block encoding of large families of useful multivariable functions, and substantiate a functional-programming approach to quantum algorithm design in recasting QSP and QSVT as monadic types.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization and its breakdown in Quantum Spin Chains with Inhomogeneous Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is a successful theory that establishes the criteria for ergodicity and thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems. In this work, we investigate the thermalization properties of spin-$ 1/2 $ XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions. We demonstrate that introduction of the inhomogeneous interactions leads to an onset of quantum chaos and thermalization, which, however, becomes inhibited for sufficiently strong inhomogeneity. To exhibit ETH, and to display its breakdown upon varying the strength of interactions, we probe statistics of energy levels and properties of matrix elements of local observables in eigenstates of the inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the survival probability which further evidence the thermalization and its breakdown in the considered model. We outline a way to experimentally realize the XXZ chain with linearly-inhomogeneous interactions in systems of ultracold atoms. Our results highlight a mechanism of emergence of ETH due to insertion of inhomogeneities in an otherwise integrable system and illustrate the arrest of quantum dynamics in presence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups for Multiproposal MCMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01402v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms choose from multiple proposals to generate their next chain step in order to sample from challenging target distributions more efficiently. However, on classical machines, these algorithms require $\mathcal{O}(P)$ target evaluations for each Markov chain step when choosing from $P$ proposals. Recent work demonstrates the possibility of quadratic quantum speedups for one such multiproposal MCMC algorithm. After generating $P$ proposals, this quantum parallel MCMC (QPMCMC) algorithm requires only $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{P})$ target evaluations at each step, outperforming its classical counterpart. However, generating $P$ proposals using classical computers still requires $\mathcal{O}(P)$ time complexity, resulting in the overall complexity of QPMCMC remaining $\mathcal{O}(P)$. Here, we present a new, faster quantum multiproposal MCMC strategy, QPMCMC2. With a specially designed Tjelmeland distribution that generates proposals close to the input state, QPMCMC2 requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ target evaluations and $\mathcal{O}(\log P)$ qubits when computing over a large number of proposals $P$. Unlike its slower predecessor, the QPMCMC2 Markov kernel (1) maintains detailed balance exactly and (2) is fully explicit for a large class of graphical models. We demonstrate this flexibility by applying QPMCMC2 to novel Ising-type models built on bacterial evolutionary networks and obtain significant speedups for Bayesian ancestral trait reconstruction for 248 observed salmonella bacteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial offers a quick, hands-on introduction to solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) models on currently available quantum computers and their simulators. We cover both IBM and D-Wave machines: IBM utilizes a gate-circuit architecture, and D-Wave is a quantum annealer. We provide examples of three canonical problems and two models from practical applications. The tutorial is structured to bridge the gap between theory and practice: we begin with an overview of QUBOs, explain their relevance and connection to quantum algorithms, introduce key quantum computing concepts, provide the foundations for two quantum heuristics, and provide detailed implementation guides. An associated GitHub repository provides the codes in five companion notebooks. In addition to reaching undergraduate and graduate students in computationally intensive disciplines, this article aims to reach working industry professionals seeking to explore the potential of near-term quantum applications. As our title indicates, this tutorial is intended to be a starting point in a journey towards solving more complex QUBOs on quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers have leaped from the theoretical realm into a race to large-scale implementations. This is due to the promise of revolutionary speedups, where achieving such speedup requires designing an algorithm that harnesses the structure of a problem using quantum mechanics. Yet many quantum programming languages today require programmers to reason at a low level of physics notation and quantum gate circuitry. This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates and trace programs without bra-ket notation. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation.</description>

Abstract: We study from a theoretical viewpoint the fundamental problem of efficiently computing the stationary distribution of general classes of structured Markov processes. In strong contrast with previous work, we consider this fundamental problem within the context of quantum computational environments from a mathematical perspective and devise the first quantum algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of general structured Markov processes. We derive a mathematical analysis of the computational properties of our quantum algorithms together with related theoretical results, establishing that our quantum algorithms provide the potential for significant computational improvements over that of the best-known and most-efficient classical algorithms in various settings of both theoretical and practical importance. Although motivated by general structured Markov processes, our quantum algorithms can be exploited to address a much larger class of numerical computation problems, as well as to potentially play the role of a subroutine as part of solving larger computational problems involving the stationary distribution on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Clifford twirling for cost-optimal quantum error mitigation in early FTQC regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this work, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. Moreover, we provide numerical demonstrations for highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, that noise effect on typical observables can be described by the global white noise. We further demonstrate that symmetric Clifford twirling and its hardware-efficient variant using only local symmetric Clifford operators can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early fault-tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Heisenberg Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-stabilizerness resource theory for operators, which is dual to that describing states. We identify that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy analog in operator space is a good magic monotone satisfying the usual conditions while inheriting efficient computability properties and providing a tight lower bound to the minimum number of non-Clifford gates in a circuit. Operationally, this measure quantifies how well an operator can be approximated by one with only a few Pauli strings -- analogous to how entanglement entropy relates to tensor-network truncation. A notable advantage of operator stabilizer entropies is their inherent locality, as captured by a Lieb-Robinson bound. This feature makes them particularly suited for studying local dynamical magic resource generation in many-body systems. We compute this quantity analytically in two distinct regimes. First, we show that under random evolution, operator magic typically reaches near-maximal value for all R\'enyi indices, and we evaluate the Page correction. Second, harnessing both dual unitarity and ZX graphical calculus, we solve the operator stabilizer entropy for interacting integrable XXZ circuit, finding that it quickly saturates to a constant value. Overall, this measure sheds light on the structural properties of many-body non-stabilizerness generation and can inspire Clifford-assisted tensor network methods.</description>

      <title>Faraday-Ramsey rotation measurement in a thin cell as an analogy to an atomic beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic beams are powerful tools for measuring spin coherence in hot vapors but require bulky setups, limiting device miniaturization. We demonstrate that micron-thin vapor cells can mimic atomic beam behavior by exploiting geometry-dependent velocity filtering. In a 5 {\mu}m rubidium cell, coherence is preserved for atoms moving parallel to the cell walls, enabling observation of the Faraday-Ramsey effect without buffer gas or anti-relaxation coatings. Using a spatially displaced pump-probe scheme and magnetic field scanning, we achieve clear Ramsey fringes and validate our model experimentally. This technique offers a compact alternative to atomic beam systems, supporting scalable sensors and frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Toward hybrid quantum simulations with qubits and qumodes on trapped-ion platforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of gate-based hybrid quantum computing using both discrete (qubit) and continuous (qumode) variables on trapped-ion platforms. Trapped-ion systems have demonstrated record one- and two-qubit gate fidelities and long qubit coherence times, while qumodes, which can be represented by the collective vibrational modes of the ion chain, have remained relatively unexplored for their use in computing. Using numerical simulations, we show that high-fidelity hybrid gates and measurement operations can be achieved for existing trapped-ion quantum platforms. As an exemplary application, we consider quantum simulations of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, which is given by a one-dimensional chain of interacting spin and boson degrees of freedom. Using classical simulations, we study its real-time evolution and develop a suitable variational quantum algorithm for ground state preparation. Our results motivate further studies of hybrid quantum computing in this context, which may lead to direct applications in condensed matter and fundamental particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Interactive Oblivious Transfer and One-Time Programs from Noisy Quantum Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Few primitives are as intertwined with the foundations of cryptography as Oblivious Transfer (OT). Not surprisingly, with the advent of quantum information processing, a major research path has emerged, aiming to minimize the requirements necessary to achieve OT by leveraging quantum resources, while also exploring the implications for secure computation. Indeed, OT has been the target of renewed focus regarding its newfound quantum possibilities (and impossibilities), both towards its computation and communication complexity. For instance, non-interactive OT, known to be impossible classically, has been strongly pursued. In its most extreme form, non-interactive chosen-input OT (one-shot OT) is equivalent to a One-Time Memory (OTM). OTMs have been proposed as tamper-proof hardware solutions for constructing One-Time Programs -- single-use programs that execute on an arbitrary input without revealing anything about their internal workings. In this work, we leverage quantum resources in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model to achieve:
  1. Unconditionally-secure two-message non-interactive OT -- the smallest number of messages known to date for unconditionally-secure chosen-input OT.
  2. Computationally-secure one-shot OT/OTM, with everlasting security, assuming only one-way functions and sequential functions -- without requiring trusted hardware, QROM, or pre-shared entanglement.
  3. One-Time Programs without the need for hardware-based solutions or QROM, by compiling our OTM construction with the [GKR08, GIS+10] compiler.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the steady-state properties of open many-body quantum systems is a fundamental challenge in quantum science and technologies. In this work, we present a scalable approach based on semi-definite programming to derive certified bounds on the expectation value of an arbitrary observable in the steady state of Lindbladian dynamics. We illustrate our method on a series of many-body systems, including paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains and two-dimensional ladders, considering both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady-states. We benchmark our method with state-of-the-art tensor-network approaches that, unlike our method, are only able to provide estimates, with no guarantee, on steady-state quantities. For the tested models, only modest computational effort is needed to obtain certified non-trivial bounds for system sizes intractable by exact methods. Our method introduces the first general numerical tool for bounding steady-state properties of open quantum dynamics, opening a new avenue in the understanding of stable configurations in many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We study consequences of applying formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics. We propose a physical interpretation of a symplectic indicator of entanglement, introduced in [1], given by the degeneracy of the symplectic form on manifolds of locally unitary equivalent states. We show that this degeneracy can be understood as an ambiguity of some classical dynamic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic (TUR) and kinetic (KUR) uncertainty relations are fundamental bounds constraining the fluctuations of current observables in classical, non-equilibrium systems. Several works have verified, however, violations of these classical bounds in open quantum systems, motivating the derivation of new quantum TURs and KURs that account for the role of quantum coherence. Here, we go one step further by deriving multidimensional KUR and TUR for multiple observables in open quantum systems undergoing Markovian dynamics. Our derivation exploits a multi-parameter metrology approach, in which the Fisher information matrix plays a central role. Crucially, our bounds are tighter than previously derived quantum TURs and KURs for single observables, precisely because they incorporate correlations between multiple observables. We also find an intriguing quantum signature of correlations that is captured by the off-diagonal element of the Fisher information matrix, which vanishes for classical stochastic dynamics. By considering two examples, namely a coherently driven qubit system and the three-level maser, we demonstrate that the multidimensional quantum KUR bound can even be saturated when the observables are perfectly correlated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction promises a viable path to fault-tolerant computations, enabling exponential error suppression when the device's error rates remain below the protocol's threshold. This threshold, however, strongly depends on the classical method used to decode the syndrome measurements. These classical algorithms traditionally only interpret binary data, ignoring valuable information contained in the complete analog measurement data. In this work, we leverage this richer "soft information" to decode repetition code experiments implemented on superconducting hardware. We find that "soft decoding" can raise the threshold by 25%, yielding up to 30 times lower error rates. Analyzing the trade-off between information volume and decoding performance we show that a single byte of information per measurement suffices to reach optimal decoding. This underscores the effectiveness and practicality of soft decoding on hardware, including in time-sensitive contexts such as real-time decoding.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of three parallel spins with genuine and restricted collective measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective measurements on identical and independent quantum systems can offer advantages in information extraction compared with individual measurements. However, little is known about the distinction between restricted collective measurements and genuine collective measurements in the multipartite setting. In this work we establish a rigorous performance gap based on a simple and old estimation problem, the estimation of a random spin state given three parallel spins. Notably, we derive an analytical formula for the maximum estimation fidelity of biseparable measurements and clarify its fidelity gap from genuine collective measurements. Moreover, we clarify the structure of optimal biseparable measurements. It turns out that the maximum estimation fidelity can be achieved by two- and one-copy measurements assisted by one-way communication in one direction, but not the other way. Our work reveals a rich landscape of multipartite nonclassicality in quantum measurements instead of quantum states and is expected to trigger further studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is an emergent field in which quantum dynamical systems are exploited for temporal information processing. In previous work, it was found a feature that makes a quantum reservoir valuable: contractive dynamics of the quantum reservoir channel toward input-dependent fixed points. These results are enhanced in this paper by finding conditions that guarantee a crucial aspect of the reservoir's design: distinguishing between different input sequences to ensure a faithful representation of temporal input data. This is implemented by finding a condition that guarantees injectivity in reservoir computing filters, with a special emphasis on the quantum case. We provide several examples and focus on a family of quantum reservoirs that is much used in the literature; it consists of an input-encoding quantum channel followed by a strictly contractive channel that enforces the echo state and the fading memory properties. This work contributes to analyzing valuable quantum reservoirs in terms of their input dependence.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulations of strongly interacting fermionic systems, such as those described by the Hubbard model, are promising candidates for useful early fault-tolerant quantum computing applications. This paper presents Tile Trotterization, a generalization of plaquette Trotterization (PLAQ), which uses a set of tiles to construct Trotter decompositions of arbitrary lattice Hubbard models. The Tile Trotterization scheme also enables the simulation of more complex models, including the extended Hubbard model. We improve previous Hubbard model commutator bounds, further provide tight commutator bounds for periodic extended Hubbard models, and demonstrate the use of tensor network methods for this task. We consider applications of Tile Trotterization to simulate hexagonal lattice Hubbard models and compare the resource requirements of Tile Trotterization for performing quantum phase estimation to a qubitization-based approach, demonstrating that Tile Trotterization scales more efficiently with system size. These advancements significantly broaden the potential applications of early fault-tolerant quantum computers to models of practical interest in materials research and organic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconciliation of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.</description>

Abstract: The interaction of a particle with vacuum fluctuations--which theoretically exist even in the complete absence of matter--can lead to observable irreversible decoherence if it were possible to switch on and off the particle charge suddenly. We compute the leading order decoherence effect for such a scenario and propose an experimental setup for its detection. Such a measurement might provide further insights into the nature of vacuum fluctuations and a novel precision test for the decoherence theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics in isolated quantum many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that an isolated and far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system should try to attain equilibrium via a mechanism whereby any given subsystem acts as an open quantum system that is coupled to an environment, which is the complementary part of the full system, and undergoes a complicated equilibration process such that all the subsystems in the long-time limit attain equilibrium states compatible with the global equilibrium state. This picture begs the question whether the dynamics of any given subsystem is Markovian (monotonic loss of information and memory) or non-Markovian. In this work, by numerically probing the dynamical behaviour of the quantum distances between $\textit{temporally-separated}$ states of small subsystems, we reveal the telltale signatures of (non-)Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems of an isolated quantum spin system brought in the far-from-equilibrium regime, exemplified with the mixed-field Ising spin chain quenched between parameter regimes deep inside its magnetically ordered and disordered regimes. Additionally, remarkably systematic behaviour is seen in a measure of classical distances between the quantum states of the considered subsystems. These features strongly depend on the direction of quenching in the parameter space, with paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic quenches offering considerably stronger signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity, for which we offer heuristic arguments.</description>

      <title>Unitality Conditions on Subsystems in Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that non-unital noise such as the amplitude damping can sometimes increase quantum correlations, while unital noise such as the dephasing usually decreases quantum correlations. It is, therefore, important to delineate the conditions, when noise can enhance the quantumness of the system. Here, we show that if the noise acting on the system is unital (non-unital), then the noise acting on the environment must also be unital (non-unital), for the evolution to be unitary in the joint system-environment space. For example, if the first two qubits are treated as system and the third qubit is treated as environment, then both the system and the environment evolve unitally in case of a three-qubit GHZ state, and both of them evolve non-unitally in case of a three-qubit W state. Our result may be of interest in quantum information, and we anticipate it to be useful in various contexts, such as to better tackle noise in quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Simulations of Dissipative Non-Adiabatic Dynamics on Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for simulating non-adiabatic vibronic dynamics on circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms. Our approach leverages hybrid oscillator-qubit quantum hardware with mid-circuit measurements and resets, enabling the incorporation of environmental effects such as dissipation and dephasing. To demonstrate its capabilities, we simulate energy transfer dynamics in a triad model of photosynthetic chromophores inspired by natural antenna systems. We specifically investigate the role of dissipation during the relaxation dynamics following photoexcitation, where electronic transitions are coupled to the evolution of quantum vibrational modes. Our results indicate that hybrid oscillator-qubit devices, operating with noise levels below the intrinsic dissipation rates of typical molecular antenna systems, can achieve the simulation fidelity required for practical computations on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spin systems, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This is done by deriving an effective magnetic field from the quantum partition function of the system to use in classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations and generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)]. In special cases where the effective field can be computed exactly we compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling. We show that our method works well across a large temperature range and can reproduce quantum expectation values for antiferromagnetic coupling which is usually not possible with classical models.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Deep Quantum Neural Network for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuits embed data in a Hilbert space whose dimensionality grows exponentially with the number of qubits, allowing even shallow parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) to represent highly-correlated probability distributions that are costly for classical networks to capture. Reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which must reason over long-horizon, continuous-control tasks, stand to benefit from this expressive quantum feature space, but only if the quantum layers can be trained jointly with the surrounding deep-neural components. Current gradient-estimation techniques (e.g., parameter-shift rule) make such hybrid training impractical for realistic RL workloads, because every gradient step requires a prohibitive number of circuit evaluations and thus erodes the potential quantum advantage. We introduce qtDNN, a tangential surrogate that locally approximates a PQC with a small differentiable network trained on-the-fly from the same minibatch. Embedding qtDNN inside the computation graph yields scalable batch gradients while keeping the original quantum layer for inference. Building on qtDNN we design hDQNN-TD3, a hybrid deep quantum neural network for continuous-control reinforcement learning based on the TD3 architecture. On the high-dimensional Humanoid-v4 benchmark, our agent reaches a test return that surpasses classical TD3, SAC and PPO baselines trained with identical compute. To our knowledge this is the first PQC-enhanced policy that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art classical performance on Humanoid. qtDNN has the potential to reduce quantum-hardware calls significantly and is designed to be compatible with today's NISQ devices. The method opens a path toward applying hybrid quantum models to large-scale RL and other gradient-intensive machine-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enabled Rydberg atomic polarimetry of radio-frequency fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms efficiently link photons between the radio-frequency (RF) and optical domains. They furnish a medium in which the presence of an RF field imprints on the transmission of a probe laser beam by altering the coherent coupling between atomic quantum states. The immutable atomic energy structure underpins quantum-metrological RF field measurements and has driven intensive efforts to realize inherently self-calibrated sensing devices. Here we investigate spectroscopic signatures owing to the angular momentum quantization of the atomic states utilized in an electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) sensing scheme for linearly polarized RF fields. Specific combinations of atomic terms are shown to give rise to universal, distinctive fingerprints in the detected optical fields upon rotating the RF field polarization. Using a dressed state picture, we identify two types of atomic angular momentum ladders that display strikingly disparate spectroscopic signatures, including the complementary absence or presence of a central spectral EIT peak. Our study adds important insights into the prospects of Rydberg atomic gases for quantum metrological electric field characterization. In particular, it calls into question prevailing interpretations of SI-traceable Rydberg atom electrometers.</description>

      <title>Accelerated State Expansion of a Nanoparticle in a Dark Inverted Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the wave packet of a massive particle grows linearly under free dynamics, it grows exponentially in an inverted harmonic potential, offering a pathway to rapidly increase quantum fluctuations to macroscopic dimensions. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate this principle by expanding the center-of-mass thermal state of a 125nm silica nanoparticle to a position uncertainty of 43.4nm within 260 $\mu$s. This expansion, achieved using an inverted dark potential to minimize decoherence from photon recoil, represents a 952-fold increase, reaching a scale comparable to the nanoparticle's physical size. This work represents a key advancement toward preparing macroscopic quantum superpositions at unprecedented mass and length scales.</description>

Abstract: A quantum algorithm for computing the determinant of a unitary matrix $U\in U(N)$ is given. The algorithm requires no preparation of eigenstates of $U$ and estimates the phase of the determinant to $t$ binary digits accuracy with $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N+t^2)$ operations and $tN$ controlled applications of $U^{2^m}$ with $m=0,\ldots,t-1$. For an orthogonal matrix $O\in O(N)$ the algorithm can determine with certainty the sign of the determinant using $\mathcal{O}(N\log^2 N)$ operations and $N$ controlled applications of $O$. An extension of the algorithm to contractions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Mildly-Interacting Fermionic Unitaries are Efficiently Learnable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that one can efficiently learn fermionic Gaussian unitaries, also commonly known as nearest-neighbor matchcircuits or non-interacting fermionic unitaries. However, one could ask a similar question about unitaries that are near Gaussian: for example, unitaries prepared with a small number of non-Gaussian circuit elements. These operators find significance in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, yet no algorithm exists to learn them.
  We give the first such result by devising an algorithm which makes queries to an $n$-mode fermionic unitary $U$ prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates and returns a circuit approximating $U$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. This resolves a central open question of Mele and Herasymenko under the strongest distance metric. In fact, our algorithm is much more general: we define a property of unitary Gaussianity known as unitary Gaussian dimension and show that our algorithm can learn $n$-mode unitaries of Gaussian dimension at least $2n - O(t)$ in time $\textrm{poly}(n,2^t,1/\varepsilon)$. Indeed, this class subsumes unitaries prepared by at most $O(t)$ non-Gaussian gates but also includes several unitaries that require up to $2^{O(t)}$ non-Gaussian gates to construct.
  In addition, we give a $\textrm{poly}(n,1/\varepsilon)$-time algorithm to distinguish whether an $n$-mode unitary is of Gaussian dimension at least $k$ or $\varepsilon$-far from all such unitaries in Frobenius distance, promised that one is the case. Along the way, we prove structural results about near-Gaussian fermionic unitaries that are likely to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle-induced decoherence of a driven superconducting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory for two quasiparticle-induced decoherence mechanisms of a driven superconducting qubit. In the first mechanism, an existing quasiparticle (QP) tunnels across the qubit's Josephson junction while simultaneously absorbing a qubit excitation and one (or several) photons from the drive. In the second mechanism, a qubit transition occurs during the non-linear absorption process converting multiple drive quanta into a pair of new QPs. Both mechanisms can remain significant in gap engineered qubits whose coherence is insensitive to QPs without the drive. Our theory establishes a fundamental limitation on fidelity of the microwave qubit operations, such as readout and gates, stemming from QPs.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.</description>

      <title>More entropy from shorter experiments using polytope approximations to the quantum set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing polytope approximations to the quantum set in a variety of device-independent quantum random number generation (DI-QRNG) protocols. Our approach relies on two general-purpose algorithms that iteratively refine an initial outer-polytope approximation, guided by typical device behaviour and cryptographic intuition. These refinements strike a balance between computational tractability and approximation effectiveness. By integrating these approximations into the probability estimation (PE) framework [Zhang et al., PRA 2018], we obtain significantly improved certified entropy bounds in the finite-size regime. We test our method on various bipartite and tripartite DI-QRNG protocols, using both simulated and experimental data. In all cases, it yields notably higher entropy rates with fewer device uses than the existing techniques. We further extend our analysis to the more demanding task of randomness amplification, demonstrating major performance gains without added complexity. These results offer an effective and ready-to-use method to prove security-with improved certified entropy rates-in the most common practical DI-QRNG protocols. Our algorithms and entropy certification with PE tools are publicly available under a non-commercial license at https://github.com/CQCL/PE_polytope_approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Michelson-type interferometric protocol for testing the quantum nature of gravity through testing the phenomenology of semi-classical gravity theory, which predicts a state-dependent Schrodinger-Newton (SN) evolution of the test mass. The protocol's feature lies in utilizing the asymmetry of two interferometric arms induced by SN self-gravity to create cross-talk between the common and differential motion of the test masses. This cross-talk is imprinted as a clean binary signature in the correlation measurements of the interferometer's output light fields. Our results demonstrate that, when assisted by 10 dB squeezed input states, 3 hours of aggregated measurement data can provide sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to conclusively test the SN theory in 1 Kelvin environment. This shows the strong feasibility of using such interferometric protocols to test if gravity operates quantum-mechanically.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>

Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would offer increased sensitivity, directionality, and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present a scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle tracking and control by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects simultaneously, the first demonstration of neuromorphic sensing for real-time control at the microscale.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in semiconductor spin qubits have achieved linear arrays exceeding ten qubits. Moving to two-dimensional (2D) qubit arrays is a critical next step to advance towards fault-tolerant implementations, but it poses substantial fabrication challenges, particularly because enabling control of nearest-neighbor entanglement requires the incorporation of interstitial exchange gates between quantum dots in the qubit architecture. In this work, we present a 2D array of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) quantum dots with tunable interdot coupling between all adjacent dots. The device is characterized at 4.2 K, where we demonstrate the formation and isolation of double-dot and triple-dot configurations. We show control of all nearest-neighbor tunnel couplings spanning up to 30 decades per volt through the interstitial exchange gates and use advanced modeling tools to estimate the exchange interactions that could be realized among qubits in this architecture. These results represent a significant step towards the development of 2D MOS quantum processors compatible with foundry manufacturing techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications.
  Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.</description>

      <title>Harvesting correlations from BTZ black hole coupled to a Lorentz-violating vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lorentz violation on correlations harvesting, specifically focusing on the harvested entanglement and harvested mutual information between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in the Lorentz-violating BTZ-like black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that Lorentz symmetry breaking has contrasting impacts on entanglement harvesting and mutual information harvesting in BTZ backgrounds: it enhances mutual information harvesting while suppressing entanglement harvesting. This phenomenon suggests that the increase in total correlations in Lorentz-violating vector field backgrounds with gravitational coupling is predominantly driven by classical components, with quantum correlations contributing less to the overall mutual information. These results indicate that Lorentz violation, as a quantum property of spacetime, may impose intrinsic constraints on the quantum information capacity encoded in spacetime due to competition among quantum degrees of freedom for resources. Furthermore, Lorentz symmetry breaking expands the \textit{entanglement shadow} region, further demonstrating its disruptive effect on quantum correlations.</description>
