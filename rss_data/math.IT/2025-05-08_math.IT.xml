      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Maximum-Likelihood Detection via Grover-based Adaptive Search for RIS-assisted Broadband Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating complexity and stringent performance demands of sixth-generation wireless systems necessitate advanced signal processing methods capable of simultaneously achieving high spectral efficiency and low computational complexity, especially under frequency-selective propagation conditions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical detection framework for broadband systems enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We address the maximum likelihood detection (MLD) problem for RIS-aided broadband wireless communications by formulating it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, that is then solved using Grover adaptive search (GAS). To accelerate convergence, we initialize the GAS algorithm with a threshold based on a classical minimum mean-squared error detector. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid classical-quantum detection scheme achieves near-optimal MLD performance while substantially reducing query complexity. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced detection strategies combined with RIS technology, offering efficient and near-optimal solutions for broadband wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing Schemes from Correlated Random Variables and Rate-Limited Public Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dealer aims to share a secret with participants so that only predefined subsets can reconstruct it, while others learn nothing. The dealer and participants access correlated randomness and communicate over a one-way, public, rate-limited channel. For this problem, we propose the first explicit coding scheme able to handle arbitrary access structures and achieve the best known achievable rates, previously obtained non-constructively. Our construction relies on lossy source coding coupled with distribution approximation to handle the reliability constraints, followed by universal hashing to handle the security constraints. We stress that our coding scheme does not require symmetry or degradation assumptions on the correlated random variables, and does not need a pre-shared secret among the participants and dealer. As a by-product, our construction also yields explicit coding schemes for secret-key generation under one-way, rate-limited public communication that, unlike prior work, achieves the capacity for arbitrary source correlations and do not require a pre-shared secret to ensure strong secrecy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Aided Design of Efficient Polarization Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04127v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes with large kernels achieve optimal error exponents but are difficult to construct when low decoding complexity is also required. We address this challenge under recursive maximum likelihood decoding (RMLD) using a rein-forcement learning approach based on the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm. The resulting method, PolarZero, consistently matches exhaustive search in identifying low-complexity kernels, and discovers a size-16 kernel with complexity comparable to handcrafted designs. Our results suggest that PolarZero is a scalable tool for large-kernel design, where brute-force search is no longer feasible.</description>

      <title>Binary Reconstruction Codes for Correcting One Deletion and One Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate binary reconstruction codes capable of correcting one deletion and one substitution. We define the \emph{single-deletion single-substitution ball} function $ \mathcal{B} $ as a mapping from a sequence to the set of sequences that can be derived from it by performing one deletion and one substitution. A binary \emph{$(n,N;\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction code} is defined as a collection of binary sequences of length $ n $ such that the intersection size between the single-deletion single-substitution balls of any two distinct codewords is strictly less than $ N $. This property ensures that each codeword can be uniquely reconstructed from $ N $ distinct elements in its single-deletion single-substitution ball. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that when $ N $ is set to $ 4n - 8 $, $ 3n - 4 $, $2n+9$, $ n+21 $, $31$, and $7$, the redundancy of binary $(n,N;\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction codes can be $0$, $1$, $2$, $ \log\log n + 3 $, $\log n + 1 $, and $ 3\log n + 4 $, respectively, where the logarithm is on base two.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO: Instantaneous versus Statistical CSI-Based Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of instantaneous CSI-based power control schemes necessitates computationally intensive signal processing operations, requiring substantial resources to handle real-time CSI updates and the associated overhead. Conversely, statistical CSIbased schemes enable efficient implementation of advanced power allocation algorithms within large-scale massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems, where the algorithms are updated much less frequently. Nevertheless, these schemes may deviate from optimal results in certain practical mMIMO configurations, necessitating the adoption of instantaneous CSI-based schemes. In addition, they may be limited in practical implementation where instantaneous CSI-based resource allocation and management schemes are widely adopted. This lecture provides a comprehensive comparison between the statistical CSI-based power allocation and instantaneous CSI-based power allocation designs for mMIMO systems from performance, complexity, and practical implementation aspects.</description>

      <title>The minimum distance of the antiprimitive BCH code with designed distance 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}_{(q,q^m+1,3,h)}$ denote the antiprimitive BCH code with designed distance 3. In this paper, we demonstrate that the minimum distance $d$ of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,q^m+1,3,h)}$ equals 3 if and only if $\gcd(2h+1,q+1,q^m+1)\ne1$. When both $q$ and $m$ are odd, we determine the sufficient and necessary condition for $d=4$ and fully characterize the minimum distance in this case. Based on these conditions, we investigate the parameters of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,q^m+1,3,h)}$ for certain $h$. Additionally, two infinite families of distance-optimal codes and several linear codes with the best known parameters are presented.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits Of Quickest Change-point Detection With Continuous-Variable Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the quantum CUSUM (QUSUM) algorithm for quickest change-point detection, analyzed in finite dimensions by Fanizza, Hirche, and Calsamiglia (Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 020602, 2023), to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Our analysis relies on a novel generalization of a result by Hayashi (Hayashi, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34, 3413, 2001) concerning the asymptotics of quantum relative entropy, which we establish for the infinite-dimensional setting. This enables us to prove that the QUSUM strategy retains its asymptotic optimality, characterized by the relationship between the expected detection delay and the average false alarm time for any pair of states with finite relative entropy. Consequently, our findings apply broadly, including continuous-variable systems (e.g., Gaussian states), facilitating the development of optimal change-point detection schemes in quantum optics and other physical platforms, and rendering experimental verification feasible.</description>

      <title>What is a Gaussian channel, and when is it physically implementable using a multiport interferometer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Gaussian channels are fundamental models for communication and information processing in continuous-variable quantum systems. This work addresses both foundational aspects and physical implementation pathways for these channels. Firstly, we provide a rigorous, unified framework by formally proving the equivalence of three principal definitions of quantum Gaussian channels prevalent in the literature, consolidating theoretical understanding. Secondly, we investigate the physical realization of these channels using multiport interferometers, a key platform in quantum optics. The central research contribution is a precise characterization of the channel parameters that correspond to Gaussian channels physically implementable via linear optical multiport interferometers. This characterization bridges the abstract mathematical description with concrete physical architectures. Along the way, we also resolve some questions posed by Parthasarathy (Indian J. Pure Appl. Math. 46, (2015)).</description>

      <title>The stability of generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups aims to recover a set of matrices, representing an unknown signal, from their associated Gram matrices, leveraging prior structural knowledge about the signal. This framework generalizes the classical phase retrieval problem, which reconstructs a signal from the magnitudes of its Fourier transform, to a richer setting involving non-abelian compact groups. In this broader context, the unknown phases in Fourier space are replaced by unknown orthogonal matrices that arise from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This problem is primarily motivated by advances in electron microscopy to determining the 3D structure of biological macromolecules from highly noisy observations. To capture realistic assumptions from machine learning and signal processing, we model the signal as belonging to one of several broad structural families: a generic linear subspace, a sparse representation in a generic basis, the output of a generic ReLU neural network, or a generic low-dimensional manifold. Our main result shows that, under mild conditions, the generalized phase retrieval problem not only admits a unique solution (up to inherent group symmetries), but also satisfies a bi-Lipschitz property. This implies robustness to both noise and model mismatch, an essential requirement for practical use, especially when measurements are severely corrupted by noise. These findings provide theoretical support for a wide class of scientific problems under modern structural assumptions, and they offer strong foundations for developing robust algorithms in high-noise regimes.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Temporal Denoising for Differentially Private Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that addresses the challenge of preserving performance in DP-SGD, where added noise typically degrades model utility. FFTKF integrates frequency-domain noise shaping with Kalman filtering to enhance gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. It employs a high-frequency shaping mask in the Fourier domain to concentrate differential privacy noise in less informative spectral components, preserving low-frequency gradient signals. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. With a per-iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$, FFTKF demonstrates improved test accuracy over DP-SGD and DiSK across MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets using CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis confirms that FFTKF maintains equivalent privacy guarantees while achieving a tighter privacy-utility trade-off through reduced noise and controlled bias.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Key Features for Model-Driven Engineering of Complex Performance Indicators: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses challenges of designing and managing Complex Performance Indicators (CPI), which amalgamate individual indicators to measure latent, yet crucial business factors like customer satisfaction or sustainability indices. Despite their significant value, designing and managing CPI is intricate; they evolve with rapidly changing business contexts and present comprehension and explanation challenges for end-users. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) emerges as a potent solution to overcome these hurdles and ensure CPI adoption, though its application to CPI remains an understudied research area. While prior efforts targeted specific CPI modeling objectives, a comprehensive overview of literature advancements is lacking. This study addresses this gap by conducting a scoping review yielding dual outcomes: (1) a comprehensive mapping of modeling features in the literature and (2) a comparative analysis of the coverage offered by the modeling frameworks. These outcomes enhance CPI understanding in academic and practitioner circles and offer insights for future MDE CPI advancements.</description>

      <title>Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</description>

      <title>Tight Regret Bounds for Bayesian Optimization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.11792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian optimization (BO) in one dimension, under a Gaussian process prior and Gaussian sampling noise. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, under fairly mild technical assumptions on the kernel, the best possible cumulative regret up to time $T$ behaves as $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$. This gives a tight characterization up to a $\sqrt{\log T}$ factor, and includes the first non-trivial lower bound for noisy BO. Our assumptions are satisfied, for example, by the squared exponential and Mat\'ern-$\nu$ kernels, with the latter requiring $\nu &gt; 2$. Our results certify the near-optimality of existing bounds (Srinivas {\em et al.}, 2009) for the SE kernel, while proving them to be strictly suboptimal for the Mat\'ern kernel with $\nu &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Computable and Faithful Lower Bound on Entanglement Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing the generalized divergence of $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are non-PPT (NPT), establishing their faithfulness for the resource theory of NPT entanglement. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of quantum states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Multiport Network Models and Performance Benefits in Full-Duplex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RIS) is a new advance in RIS techniques that introduces reconfigurable inter-element connections to generate scattering matrices not limited to being diagonal. BD-RIS has been recently proposed and proven to have benefits in enhancing channel gain and enlarging coverage in wireless communications. Uniquely, BD-RIS enables reciprocal and non-reciprocal architectures characterized by symmetric and non-symmetric scattering matrices. However, the performance benefits and new use cases enabled by non-reciprocal BD-RIS for wireless systems remain unexplored. This work takes a first step toward closing this knowledge gap and studies the non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems and its performance benefits over reciprocal counterparts. We start by deriving a general RIS aided full-duplex system model using a multiport circuit theory, followed by a simplified channel model based on physically consistent assumptions. With the considered channel model, we investigate the effect of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and identify the theoretical conditions for reciprocal and non-reciprocal BD-RISs to simultaneously achieve the maximum received power of the signal of interest in the uplink and the downlink. Simulation results validate the theories and highlight the significant benefits offered by non-reciprocal BD-RIS in full-duplex systems. The significant gains are achieved because of the non-reciprocity principle which implies that if a wave hits the non-reciprocal BD-RIS from one direction, the surface behaves differently than if it hits from the opposite direction. This enables an uplink user and a downlink user at different locations to optimally communicate with the same full-duplex base station via a non-reciprocal BD-RIS, which would not be possible with reciprocal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Information-Geometric Barycenters for Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed optimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally trained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian inference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space. Taking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as the problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified divergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This perspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing methods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then propose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of Federated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically distributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical aggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification and model calibration.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Aware Updates from Remote Energy Harvesting Devices to Interconnected LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing timely and informative data in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks is critical as data volume grows while the resources available on devices remain limited. To address this, we adopt a semantics-aware approach to optimize the Version Age of Information (VAoI) in a status update system in which a remote Energy Harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) device samples data and transmits it to a network of interconnected Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for dissemination and utilization. The optimal update policy is derived through stochastic modeling and optimization of the VAoI across the network. The results indicate that this policy reduces the frequency of updates by skipping stale or irrelevant data, significantly improving energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of tempered stable processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Beginning with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, we obtain the corresponding Fisher information matrices and the $\alpha$-connections on their statistical manifolds. Furthermore, we explore statistical applications of this geometric framework. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly-decreasing tempered stable processes are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing: Generic Constructions and Lattice-Based Instantiations in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Publicly verifiable secret sharing (PVSS) allows a dealer to share a secret among a set of shareholders so that the secret can be reconstructed later from any set of qualified participants. In addition, any public verifier should be able to check the correctness of the sharing and reconstruction process. PVSS has been demonstrated to yield various applications, such as e-voting, distributed key generation, decentralized random number generation protocols, and multi-party computation. Although many concrete PVSS protocols have been proposed, their security is either proven in the random oracle model or relies on quantum-vulnerable assumptions such as factoring or discrete logarithm. In this work, we put forward a generic construction for PVSS that can be instantiated in the standard model under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption. Our instantiation provides the first post-quantum PVSS in the standard model, with a reasonable level of asymptotic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves neural network generalization by optimizing the worst-case loss within a neighborhood of parameters, yet it perturbs parameters using the entire gradient vector, including components with low statistical significance. We introduce ZSharp, a refined sharpness-aware optimization method that incorporates layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering. This process selects only the most statistically significant gradient components-those with large standardized magnitudes-for constructing the perturbation direction. ZSharp retains the standard two-phase SAM structure of ascent and descent while modifying the ascent step to focus on sharper, curvature-relevant directions. We evaluate ZSharp on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using a range of models including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers. Across all architectures and datasets, ZSharp consistently achieves higher test accuracy compared to SAM, ASAM, and Friendly-SAM. These results indicate that Z-score-based gradient filtering can enhance the sharpness sensitivity of the update direction, leading to improved generalization in deep neural network training.</description>
