      <title>SubwayMeshDTN: Exploring Opportunistic Delay Tolerant Routing Protocols when Disseminating Emergency Alerts on a Smart City Subway Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to understand the effectiveness of using multi-dimensional opportunistic delay-tolerant network (DTN) routing protocols, specifically Epidemic and MaxProp, in the context of New York City (NYC) metropolitan subway network. We examine how efficiently emergency messages spread through mobile, self-configuring, edge-based movement patterns on the train network to understand and propose solutions for improving communication in subterranean environments. Since DTNs are able to store, carry and forward messages through intermediate edges, this paper benchmarks both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth topologies to compare and critically evaluate movement patterns, latency, overheads and delivery rates on pseudo-realistic underground traces. We also show that the accordion effect is predominant in these networks, and therefore, the most effective protocol configurations vary.</description>

      <title>TV White Space and LTE Network Optimization towards Energy Efficiency in Suburban and Rural Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio spectrum is a limited resource. Demand for wireless communication services is increasing exponentially, stressing the availability of radio spectrum to accommodate new services. TV White Space (TVWS) technologies allow a dynamic usage of the spectrum. These technologies provide wireless connectivity, in the channels of the Very High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) television broadcasting bands. In this paper, we investigate and compare the coverage range, network capacity, and network energy efficiency for TVWS technologies and LTE. We consider Ghent, Belgium and Boyeros, Havana, Cuba to evaluate a realistic outdoor suburban and rural area, respectively. The comparison shows that TVWS networks have an energy efficiency 9-12 times higher than LTE networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Optimization of Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New generation networks, based on Cognitive Radio technology, allow dynamic allocation of the spectrum, alleviating spectrum scarcity. These networks also have a resilient potential for dynamic operation for energy saving. In this paper, we present a novel wireless network optimization algorithm for cognitive radio networks based on a cloud sharing-decision mechanism. Three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were optimized: spectrum usage, power consumption, and exposure of human beings. For a realistic suburban scenario in Ghent city, Belgium, we determine the optimality among the KPIs. Compared to a traditional Cognitive Radio network design, our optimization algorithm for the cloud-based architecture reduced the network power consumption by 27.5%, the average global exposure by 34.3%, and spectrum usage by 34.5% at the same time. Even for the worst optimization case, our solution performs better than the traditional architecture by 4.8% in terms of network power consumption, 7.3% in terms of spectrum usage and 4.3% in terms of global exposure.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent RL-Based Industrial AIGC Service Offloading over Wireless Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the generative model has garnered considerable attention due to its application in addressing the challenge of scarcity of abnormal samples in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, challenges persist regarding the edge deployment of generative models and the optimization of joint edge AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks. In this paper, we focus on the edge optimization of AIGC task execution and propose GMEL, a generative model-driven industrial AIGC collaborative edge learning framework. This framework aims to facilitate efficient few-shot learning by leveraging realistic sample synthesis and edge-based optimization capabilities. First, a multi-task AIGC computational offloading model is presented to ensure the efficient execution of heterogeneous AIGC tasks on edge servers. Then, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (AMARL) algorithm aimed at refining offloading policies within the IoT system, thereby supporting generative model-driven edge learning. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing the total system latency of the edge-based AIGC task completion.</description>

      <title>Automatic Retrieval-augmented Generation of 6G Network Specifications for Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G Open Radio Access Networks (ORAN) promises to open data interfaces to enable plug-and-play service Apps, many of which are consumer and business-facing. Opening up 6G access lowers the barrier to innovation but raises the challenge that the required communication specifications are not fully known to all service designers. As such, business innovators must either be familiar with 6G standards or consult with experts. Enabling consistent, unbiased, rapid, and low-cost requirement assessment and specification generation is crucial to the ORAN innovation ecosystem.
  Here, we discuss our initiative to bridge service specification generation gaps between network service providers and business innovators. We first review the state-of-the-art and motivation in 6G plug-and-play services and capabilities, potential use cases, and relevant advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify an ample innovation space for hybrid use cases that may require diverse and variational wireless functionalities across its operating time. We show that the network specification can be automated and present the first automatic retrieval-augmented specification generation (RAG) framework for 6G use cases. To enable public acceptance and feedback, a website interface is also published for the research and industrial community to experiment with the RAG framework. We hope this review highlights the need and the emerging foundation models that advance this area and motivate researchers to engage with the framework.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Cooperative Perception in Urban Air Mobility for Enhanced Environmental Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is growing with prospective air taxis, parcel deliverers, and medical and industrial services. Safe and efficient UAM operation relies on timely communication and reliable data exchange. In this paper, we explore Cooperative Perception (CP) for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), considering the unique communication needs involving high dynamics and a large number of UAS. We propose a hybrid approach combining local broadcast with a central CP service, inspired by centrally managed U-space and broadcast mechanisms from automotive and aviation domains. In a simulation study, we show that our approach significantly enhances the environmental awareness for UAS compared to fully distributed approaches, with an increased communication channel load, which we also evaluate. These findings prompt a discussion on communication strategies for CP in UAM and the potential of a centralized CP service in future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the impending arrival of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communication technology, the telecommunications landscape is poised for another revolutionary transformation. At the forefront of this evolution are intelligent meta-surfaces (IS), emerging as a disruptive physical layer technology with the potential to redefine the capabilities and performance metrics of future wireless networks. As 6G evolves from concept to reality, industry stakeholders, standards organizations, and regulatory bodies are collaborating to define the specifications, protocols, and interoperability standards governing IS deployment. Against this background, this article delves into the ongoing standardization efforts, emerging trends, potential opportunities, and prevailing challenges surrounding the integration of IS into the framework of 6G and beyond networks. Specifically, it provides a tutorial-style overview of recent advancements in IS and explores their potential applications within future networks beyond 6G. Additionally, the article identifies key challenges in the design and implementation of various types of intelligent surfaces, along with considerations for their practical standardization. Finally, it highlights potential future prospects in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Snake Learning: A Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Learning Framework for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolution towards 6G, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with advanced network infrastructure emerges as a pivotal strategy for enhancing network intelligence and resource utilization. Existing distributed learning frameworks like Federated Learning and Split Learning often struggle with significant challenges in dynamic network environments including high synchronization demands, costly communication overheads, severe computing resource consumption, and data heterogeneity across network nodes. These obstacles hinder the applications of ubiquitous computing capabilities of 6G networks, especially in light of the trend of escalating model parameters and training data volumes. To address these challenges effectively, this paper introduces "Snake Learning", a cost-effective distributed learning framework. Specifically, Snake Learning respects the heterogeneity of inter-node computing capability and local data distribution in 6G networks, and sequentially trains the designated part of model layers on individual nodes. This layer-by-layer serpentine update mechanism contributes to significantly reducing the requirements for storage, memory and communication during the model training phase, and demonstrates superior adaptability and efficiency for both Computer Vision (CV) training and Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning tasks across homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions.</description>

      <title>ReinWiFi: A Reinforcement-Learning-Based Framework for the Application-Layer QoS Optimization of WiFi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement-learning-based scheduling framework is proposed and implemented to optimize the application-layer quality-of-service (QoS) of a practical wireless local area network (WLAN) suffering from unknown interference. Particularly, application-layer tasks of file delivery and delay-sensitive communication, e.g., screen projection, in a WLAN with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism, are jointly scheduled by adjusting the contention window sizes and application-layer throughput limitation, such that their QoS, including the throughput of file delivery and the round trip time of the delay-sensitive communication, can be optimized. Due to the unknown interference and vendor-dependent implementation of the network interface card, the relation between the scheduling policy and the system QoS is unknown. Hence, a reinforcement learning method is proposed, in which a novel Q-network is trained to map from the historical scheduling parameters and QoS observations to the current scheduling action. It is demonstrated on a testbed that the proposed framework can achieve a significantly better QoS than the conventional EDCA mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Overview and Survey of O-RAN: Exploring Slicing-aware Architecture, Deployment Options, and Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-radio access network (O-RAN) seeks to establish principles of openness, programmability, automation, intelligence, and hardware-software disaggregation with interoperable interfaces. It advocates for multi-vendorism and multi-stakeholderism within a cloudified and virtualized wireless infrastructure, aimed at enhancing the deployment, operation, and maintenance of RAN architecture. This enhancement promises increased flexibility, performance optimization, service innovation, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency in fifth-generation (5G), sixth-generation (6G), and future networks. One of the key features of the O-RAN architecture is its support for network slicing, which entails interaction with other slicing domains within a mobile network, notably the transport network (TN) domain and the core network (CN) domain, to realize end-to-end (E2E) network slicing. The study of this feature requires exploring the stances and contributions of diverse standards development organizations (SDOs). In this context, we note that despite the ongoing industrial deployments and standardization efforts, the research and standardization communities have yet to comprehensively address network slicing in O-RAN. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a comprehensive exploration of network slicing in O-RAN through an in-depth review of specification documents from O-RAN Alliance and research papers from leading industry and academic institutions. The paper commences with an overview of the ongoing standardization efforts and open-source contributions associated with O-RAN, subsequently delving into the latest O-RAN architecture with an emphasis on its slicing aspects. Further, the paper explores deployment scenarios for network slicing within O-RAN, examining options for the deployment and orchestration of O-RAN and TN network slice subnets...</description>

      <title>Analysis of Asynchronous Protocols for Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement in quantum networks is typically approached under idealized assumptions such as perfect synchronization and centralized control, while classical communication is often neglected. However, these assumptions prove impractical in large-scale networks. In this paper, we present a pragmatic perspective by exploring two minimal asynchronous protocols: a parallel scheme generating entanglement independently at the link level, and a sequential scheme extending entanglement iteratively from one party to the other. Our analysis incorporates non-uniform repeater spacings and classical communications and accounts for quantum memory decoherence. We evaluate network performance using metrics such as entanglement bit rate, end-to-end fidelity, and secret key rate for entanglement-based quantum key distribution. Our findings suggest the sequential scheme's superiority due to comparable performance with the parallel scheme, coupled with simpler implementation. Additionally, we propose a cutoff strategy to improve performance by discarding attempts with prolonged memory idle time, effectively eliminating low-quality entanglement links. Finally, we apply our methods to the real-world topology of SURFnet and report the performance as a function of memory coherence time.</description>

      <title>Deduplicator: When Computation Reuse Meets Load Balancing at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Load balancing has been a fundamental building block of cloud and, more recently, edge computing environments. At the same time, in edge computing environments, prior research has highlighted that applications operate on similar (correlated) data. Based on this observation, prior research has advocated for the direction of "computation reuse", where the results of previously executed computational tasks are stored at the edge and are reused (if possible) to satisfy incoming tasks with similar input data, instead of executing incoming tasks from scratch. Both load balancing and computation reuse are critical to the deployment of scalable edge computing environments, yet they are contradictory in nature. In this paper, we propose the Deduplicator, a middlebox that aims to facilitate both load balancing and computation reuse at the edge. The Deduplicator features mechanisms to identify and deduplicate similar tasks offloaded by user devices, collect information about the usage of edge servers' resources, manage the addition of new edge servers and the failures of existing edge servers, and ultimately balance the load imposed on edge servers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the Deduplicator achieves up to 20% higher percentages of computation reuse compared to several other load balancing approaches, while also effectively balancing the distribution of tasks among edge servers at line rate.</description>

      <title>Swipe2Pair: Secure and Fast In-Band Wireless Device Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless device pairing is a critical security mechanism to bootstrap the secure communication between two devices without a pre-shared secret. It has been widely used in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart-home and smart-health. Most existing device pairing mechanisms are based on out-of-band channels, e.g., extra sensors or hardware, to validate the proximity of pairing devices. However, out-of-band channels are not universal across all wireless devices, so such a scheme is limited to certain application scenarios or conditions. On the other hand, in-band channel-based device pairing seeks universal applicability by only relying on wireless interfaces. Existing in-band channel-based pairing schemes either require multiple antennas separated by a good distance on one pairing device, which is not feasible in certain scenarios, or require users to repeat multiple sweeps, which is not optimal in terms of usability.
  Therefore, an in-band wireless device pairing scheme providing high security while maintaining high usability (simple pairing process and minimal user intervention) is highly desired. In this work, we propose an easy-to-use mutual authentication device pairing scheme, named Swipe2Pair, based on the proximity of pairing devices and randomization of wireless transmission power. We conduct extensive security analysis and collect considerable experimental data under various settings across different environments. Experimental results show that Swipe2Pair achieves high security and usability. It only takes less than one second to complete the pairing process with a simple swipe of one device in front of the other.</description>

      <title>State-Aware Timeliness in Energy Harvesting IoT Systems Monitoring a Markovian Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optimal transmission policies within an energy harvesting status update system, where the demand for status updates depends on the state of the source. The system monitors a two-state Markovian source that characterizes a stochastic process, which can be in either a normal state or an alarm state, with a higher demand for fresh updates when the source is in the alarm state. We propose a metric to capture the freshness of status updates for each state of the stochastic process by introducing two Age of Information (AoI) variables, extending the definition of AoI to account for the state changes of the stochastic process. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), utilizing a transition cost function that applies linear and non-linear penalties based on AoI and the state of the stochastic process. Through analytical investigation, we delve into the structure of the optimal transmission policy for the resulting MDP problem. Furthermore, we evaluate the derived policies via numerical results and demonstrate their effectiveness in reserving energy in anticipation of forthcoming alarm states.</description>

      <title>NetLLM: Adapting Large Language Models for Networking</title>

Abstract: Many networking tasks now employ deep learning (DL) to solve complex prediction and system optimization problems. However, current design philosophy of DL-based algorithms entails intensive engineering overhead due to the manual design of deep neural networks (DNNs) for different networking tasks. Besides, DNNs tend to achieve poor generalization performance on unseen data distributions/environments.
  Motivated by the recent success of large language models (LLMs), for the first time, this work studies the LLM adaptation for networking to explore a more sustainable design philosophy. With the massive pre-trained knowledge and powerful inference ability, LLM can serve as the foundation model, and is expected to achieve "one model for all" with even better performance and stronger generalization for various tasks. In this paper, we present NetLLM, the first LLM adaptation framework that efficiently adapts LLMs to solve networking problems. NetLLM addresses many practical challenges in LLM adaptation, from how to process task-specific information with LLMs, to how to improve the efficiency of answer generation and acquiring domain knowledge for networking. Across three networking-related use cases - viewport prediction (VP), adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) and cluster job scheduling (CJS), we demonstrate the effectiveness of NetLLM in LLM adaptation for networking, and showcase that the adapted LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Power Factor Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The uplink sum-throughput of distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks depends majorly on Access point (AP)-User Equipment (UE) association and power control. The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing these two problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Empowered Task Assignment in Aerial MEC Network: A Resource Coalition Cooperation Approach with Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the demands for ubiquitous communication and temporary edge computing in 6G networks, aerial mobile edge computing (MEC) networks have been envisioned as a new paradigm. However, dynamic user requests pose challenges for task assignment strategies. Most of the existing research assumes that the strategy is deployed on ground-based stations or UAVs, which will be ineffective in an environment lacking infrastructure and continuous energy supply. Moreover, the resource mutual exclusion problem of dynamic task assignment has not been effectively solved. Toward this end, we introduce the digital twin (DT) into the aerial MEC network to study the resource coalition cooperation approach with the generative model (GM), which provides a preliminary coalition structure for the coalition game. Specifically, we propose a novel network framework that is composed of an application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. After that, the task assignment problem is simplified to convex optimization programming with linear constraints. And then, we also propose a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game to obtain an approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of energy consumption and utilization of resources.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Federated Learning: A Survey and Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been gaining attention for its ability to share knowledge while maintaining user data, protecting privacy, increasing learning efficiency, and reducing communication overhead. Decentralized FL (DFL) is a decentralized network architecture that eliminates the need for a central server in contrast to centralized FL (CFL). DFL enables direct communication between clients, resulting in significant savings in communication resources. In this paper, a comprehensive survey and profound perspective are provided for DFL. First, a review of the methodology, challenges, and variants of CFL is conducted, laying the background of DFL. Then, a systematic and detailed perspective on DFL is introduced, including iteration order, communication protocols, network topologies, paradigm proposals, and temporal variability. Next, based on the definition of DFL, several extended variants and categorizations are proposed with state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies. Lastly, in addition to summarizing the current challenges in the DFL, some possible solutions and future research directions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity: a Standard-compatible Sybil-resistant Pseudonym Extension for C-ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudonyms are widely used in Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) to protect the location privacy of vehicles. However, the unlinkability nature of pseudonyms also enables Sybil attacks, where a malicious vehicle can pretend to be multiple vehicles at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol called zero-knowledge Proof of Distinct Identity (zk-PoDI,) which allows a vehicle to prove that it is not the owner of another pseudonym in the local area, without revealing its actual identity. Zk-PoDI is based on the Diophantine equation and zk-SNARK, and does not rely on any specific pseudonym design or infrastructure assistance. We show that zk-PoDI satisfies all the requirements for a practical Sybil-resistance pseudonym system, and it has low latency, adjustable difficulty, moderate computation overhead, and negligible communication cost. We also discuss the future work of implementing and evaluating zk-PoDI in a realistic city-scale simulation environment.</description>
