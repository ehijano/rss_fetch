      <title>Classical Mechanics as an Emergent Compression of Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correspondence principle states that classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in the appropriate limits. However, beyond this heuristic rule, an information-theoretic perspective reveals that classical mechanics is a compressed, lower-information representation of quantum reality. Quantum mechanics encodes significantly more information through superposition, entanglement, and phase coherence, which are lost due to decoherence, phase averaging, and measurement, reducing the system to a classical probability distribution. This transition is quantified using Kolmogorov complexity, where classical systems require \( O(N) \) bits of information, while quantum descriptions require \( O(2^N) \), showing an exponential reduction in complexity. Further justification comes from Ehrenfest's theorem, which ensures that quantum expectation values obey Newton's laws, and path integral suppression, which eliminates non-classical trajectories when \( S \gg \hbar \). Thus, rather than viewing quantum mechanics as an extension of classical mechanics, we argue that classical mechanics is a lossy, computationally reduced encoding of quantum physics, emerging from a systematic loss of quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-preserved transport of excitations in Rydberg-dressed atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To transport high-quality quantum state between two distant qubits through one-dimensional spin chains, the perfect state transfer (PST) method serves as the first choice, due to its natively perfect transfer fidelity that is independent of the system dimension. However, the PST requires a precise modulation of the local pulse parameters as well as an accurate timing of dynamic evolution, and is thus very sensitive to variations in practice. Here, we propose a protocol for achieving quantum-preserved transport of excitations using an array of Rydberg-dressed atoms, enabled by optimal control of minimally global parameters. By treating the weak coupling of two marginal array atoms as a perturbation, an effective spin-exchange model with highly tunable interactions between the external weak and the inner strong driving atoms can be established, which allows for coherent excitation transfer even with large atomic position fluctuation. We furthermore show that the existence of long-time excitation propagation unattainable for systems under antiblockade facilitation conditions. Our results highlight an easily-implemented scheme for studying the dynamics of spin systems using Rydberg atoms and may guide the avenue to the engineering of complex many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>The (un)detectability of trajectories in pilot-wave theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pilot wave theory endows particles with definite positions at all times governed by deterministic dynamics. However, individual particle trajectories are generically undetectable by experiment. This idea might seem to be contested in light of two proposals: (1) So-called 'weak velocity measurements', allegedly detecting Bohmian trajectories by weakly probing a quantum system without essentially disturbing it, and (2) the so-called 'surrealistic' trajectories experiment which supposedly establishes a conflict between the 'actual' position of a particle and its position derived from pilot wave theory. Although both attempts shed light on the nature of Bohmian particles, neither constitute empirical or theoretical evidence in favour or against pilot wave theory. Both instances admit a straightforward standard quantum mechanical interpretation compatible with the predictions of Bohmian theories. It is concluded that the puzzles arise from the absence of a coherent account of what quantum mechanical measurements signify.</description>

      <title>Counting with the quantum alternating operator ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) for the approximate solution of computationally hard counting problems. Our algorithm, dubbed VQCount, is based on the equivalence between random sampling and approximate counting and employs QAOA as a solution sampler. We first prove that VQCount improves upon previous work by reducing exponentially the number of samples needed to obtain an approximation within a multiplicative factor of the exact count. Using tensor network simulations, we then study the typical performance of VQCount with shallow circuits on synthetic instances of two #P-hard problems, positive #NAE3SAT and positive #1-in-3SAT. We employ the original quantum approximate optimization algorithm version of QAOA, as well as the Grover-mixer variant which guarantees a uniform solution probability distribution. We observe a tradeoff between QAOA success probability and sampling uniformity, which we exploit to achieve an exponential gain in efficiency over naive rejection sampling. Our results highlight the potential and limitations of variational algorithms for approximate counting.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07742v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Corrected Non-Markovian Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to maximize measurement precision on quantum systems, with a wide range of applications in quantum sensing. Achieving the Heisenberg limit (HL) - the fundamental precision bound set by quantum mechanics - is often hindered by noise-induced decoherence, which typically reduces achievable precision to the standard quantum limit (SQL). While quantum error correction (QEC) can recover the HL under Markovian noise, its applicability to non-Markovian noise remains less explored. In this work, we analyze a hidden Markov model in which a quantum probe, coupled to an inaccessible environment, undergoes joint evolution described by Lindbladian dynamics, with the inaccessible degrees of freedom serving as a memory. We derive generalized Knill-Laflamme conditions for the hidden Markov model and establish three types of sufficient conditions for achieving the HL under non-Markovian noise using QEC. Additionally, we demonstrate the attainability of the SQL when these sufficient conditions are violated, by analytical solutions for special cases and numerical methods for general scenarios. Our results not only extend prior QEC frameworks for metrology but also provide new insights into precision limits under realistic noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-based Variational Approach for Solving Graph Isomorphism Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The graph isomorphism problem remains a fundamental challenge in computer science, driving the search for efficient decision algorithms. Due to its ambiguous computational complexity, heuristic approaches such as simulated annealing are frequently used to explore the solution space selectively. These methods often achieve high probabilities of identifying solutions quickly, avoiding the exhaustive enumeration required by exact algorithms. However, traditional simulated annealing usually struggles with low sampling efficiency and reduced solution-finding probability in complex or large graph problems. In this study, we integrate the principles of quantum technology to address the graph isomorphism problem. By mapping the solution space to a quantum many-body system, we developed a parameterized model for variational simulated annealing. This approach emphasizes the regions of the solution space that are most likely to contain the optimal solution, thereby enhancing the search accuracy. Artificial neural networks were utilized to parameterize the quantum many-body system, leveraging their capacity for efficient function approximation to perform accurate sampling in the intricate energy landscapes of large graph problems.</description>

      <title>Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</description>

      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz bound on the accuracy of truncated models in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides a simple yet general bound that limits the accuracy of light-matter theories which retain only finite numbers of material energy levels. A corollary is that unitary rotations within a truncated space cannot transform between gauges, because the contrary assumption yields incorrect predictions. In particular, a widespread model obtained using such a rotation and treated as a Coulomb gauge model within a substantial body of literature, yields incorrect predictions under this assumption. The simplest system of a single dipole coupled to a single photonic mode in one spatial dimension is analysed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical absorption within the conduction-subbands of a cylindrical GaN/AlN quantum wire. We analyze the optical absorption rate and the real part of the dielectric function for both quantum wire (QWR) and quantum dot (QD) structures in the presence of donor-impurity states. The results cover that the density of states associated with free motion in the QWR structure leads to a lower optical absorption compared to the QDs, as evidenced by the optical spectra. This study advances the understanding of GaN/AlN heterostructures by offering a comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of QWRs and QDs, especially under donor-doping situation. As a result, the outcomes provide a clear evidence of the effect of semiconductor nanostructures on the optical properties of optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>In Search Of Lost Tunneling Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of tunneling times in strong-field ionization has been the topic of much controversy in recent years, with the attoclock and Larmor clock being two of the main contenders for correctly reproducing these times. By expressing the attoclock as the weak value of temporal delay, we extend its meaning beyond the traditional setup. This allows us to calculate the attoclock time for a static one-dimensional tunneling model consisting of a binding delta potential and a constant electric field. We apply the Steinberg weak-value interpretation of the Larmor clock. Using this definition, we obtain the position-resolved time density during tunnel ionization, yielding a non-zero Larmor tunneling time. Our model allows us to derive the analogue of the position-resolved attoclock tunneling time. While non-zero at the tunnel exit, it vanishes at the detector, far away from the atom. Formally, this means that the attoclock does not measure the "local" Larmor time, but instead a "non-local" time closely related to the phase time.</description>

Abstract: A lattice beam configuration which results in an isotropic 3D trap near the surface of an atom chip is described. The lattice is formed near the surface of a reflectively coated atom chip, where three incident beams and three reflected beams intersect. The coherent interference of these six beams form a phase-stable optical lattice which extends to the surface of the atom chip. The lattice is experimentally realized and the trap frequency is measured. Degenerate Raman sideband cooling is performed in the optical lattice, cooling 80 million atoms to 1.1 $\mu$K.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Routing Optimization Using Coherent Ising Machine in Wireless Multihop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization in wireless communication networks is a challenging task, particularly for large-scale and diverse topologies. Recent advances in quantum computing offer promising solutions for such problems. Coherent Ising Machines (CIM), a quantum-inspired algorithm, leverages the quantum properties of coherent light, enabling faster convergence to the ground state. This paper applies CIM to multi-objective routing optimization in wireless multi-hop networks. We formulate the routing problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and map it onto an Ising model, allowing CIM to solve it. CIM demonstrates strong scalability across diverse network topologies without requiring topology-specific adjustments, overcoming the limitations of traditional quantum algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that CIM provides feasible and near-optimal solutions for networks containing hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges. Additionally, a complexity analysis highlights CIM's increasing efficiency as network size grows</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for efficiently and accurately estimating Lipschitz constants in hybrid quantum-classical decision models. Our approach integrates classical neural network with quantum variational circuits to address critical issues in learning theory such as fairness verification, robust training, and generalization.
  By a unified convex optimization formulation, we extend existing classical methods to capture the interplay between classical and quantum layers. This integrated strategy not only provide a tight bound on the Lipschitz constant but also improves computational efficiency with respect to the previous methods.</description>

      <title>Complete Measurement of Two-Photon Density Matrix by Single-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of density matrices from measurement data (quantum state tomography) is the most comprehensive method for assessing the accuracy and performance of quantum devices. Existing methods to reconstruct two-photon density matrices require the detection of both photons unless a priori information is available. Based on the concept of quantum-induced coherence by path identity, we present an approach to quantum state tomography that circumvents the requirement of detecting both photons. We show that an arbitrary two-qubit density matrix, which can contain up to fifteen free parameters, can be fully reconstructed from single-photon measurement data without any postselection and a priori information. In addition to advancing an alternative approach to quantum state measurement problems, our results also have notable practical implications. A practical challenge in quantum state measurement arises from the fact that effective single-photon detectors are not readily accessible for a wide spectral range. Our method, which eliminates the need for coincidence measurements, enables quantum state tomography in the case where one of the two photons is challenging or impossible to detect. It therefore opens the door to measuring quantum states hitherto inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Preserving Mass Shell Condition in the Stochastic Optimal Control Derivation of the Dirac Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac equation, central to relativistic quantum mechanics, governs spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and their antiparticles, with each spinor component satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation - the quantum counterpart of the relativistic mass shell condition. Our prior work [V. Yordanov, Sci. Rep. 14, 6507 (2024)] derived Dirac equation using stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory by linearizing the Lagrangian's kinetic term and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, but failed to preserve the mass shell condition. Here, we introduce a novel SOC derivation that retains the nonlinear kinetic term and integrates spin-electromagnetic coupling into the potential, ensuring relativistic consistency. This approach not only addresses the limitations of the previous model but also deepens the link between stochastic mechanics and quantum theory, offering fresh insights into relativistic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>A simple model of quantum walk with a gap in distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks are quantum counterparts of random walks and their probability distributions are different from each other. A quantum walker distributes on a Hilbert space and it is observed at a location with a probability. The finding probabilities have been investigated and some interesting things have been analytically discovered. They are, for instance, ballistic behavior, localization, or a gap. We study a 1-dimensional quantum walk in this paper. Although the walker launches off a location under a localized initial state, some numerical experiments show that the quantum walker does not seem to distribute around the launching location, which suggests that the probability distribution holds a gap around the launching location. To prove the gap analytically, we derive a long-time limit distribution, from which one can tell more details about the finding probability.</description>

      <title>Quantum squeezing amplification with a weak Kerr nonlinear oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum squeezed states, with reduced quantum noise, have been widely utilized in quantum sensing and quantum error correction applications. However, generating and manipulating these nonclassical states with a large squeezing degree typically requires strong nonlinearity, which inevitably induces additional decoherence that diminishes the overall performance. Here, we demonstrate the generation and amplification of squeezed states in a superconducting microwave cavity with weak Kerr nonlinearity. By subtly engineering an off-resonant microwave drive, we observe cyclic dynamics of the quantum squeezing evolution for various Fock states |N&gt; with N up to 6 in displaced frame of the cavity. Furthermore, we deterministically realize quantum squeezing amplification by alternately displacing the Kerr oscillator using the Trotterization technique, achieving a maximum squeezing degree of 14.6 dB and squeezing rate of 0.28 MHz. Our hardware-efficient displacement-enhanced squeezing operations provide an alternative pathway for generating large squeezed states, promising potential applications in quantum-enhanced sensing and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Unitary Transformations using Robust Optimal Control on a Cold Atom Qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design and experimentally implement various robust quantum unitary transformations (gates) acting on $d$-dimensional vectors (qudits) by tuning a single control parameter using optimal control theory. The quantum state is represented by the momentum components of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) placed in an optical lattice, with the lattice position varying over a fixed duration serving as the control parameter. To evaluate the quality of these transformations, we employ standard quantum process tomography. In addition, we show how controlled unitary transformations can be used to extend state stabilization to global stabilization within a controlled vector subspace. Finally, we apply them to state tomography, showing how the information about the relative phase between distant momentum components can be extracted by inducing an interference process.</description>

      <title>Scrambling for precision: optimizing multiparameter qubit estimation in the face of sloppiness and incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum estimation theory plays a crucial role in advancing quantum metrology. Recent studies focused on fundamental challenges such as enhancing precision in the presence of incompatibility or sloppiness, yet the relationship between these features remains poorly understood. In this work, we explore the connection between sloppiness and incompatibility by introducing an adjustable scrambling operation for parameter encoding. Using a minimal yet versatile two-parameter qubit model, we examine the trade-off between sloppiness and incompatibility and discuss: (1) how information scrambling can improve estimation, and (2) how the correlations between the parameters and the incompatibility between the symmetric logarithmic derivatives impose constraints on the ultimate quantum limits to precision. Through analytical optimization, we identify strategies to mitigate these constraints and enhance estimation efficiency. We also compare the performance of joint parameter estimation to strategies involving successive separate estimation steps, demonstrating that the ultimate precision can be achieved when sloppiness is minimized. Our results provide a unified perspective on the trade-offs inherent to multiparameter qubit statistical models, offering practical insights for optimizing experimental designs.</description>

      <title>Single-Qubit Gates Beyond the Rotating-Wave Approximation for Strongly Anharmonic Low-Frequency Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-qubit gates are in many quantum platforms applied using a linear drive resonant with the qubit transition frequency which is often theoretically described within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). However, for fast gates on low-frequency qubits, the RWA may not hold and we need to consider the contribution from counter-rotating terms to the qubit dynamics. The inclusion of counter-rotating terms into the theoretical description gives rise to two challenges. Firstly, it becomes challenging to analytically calculate the time evolution as the Hamiltonian is no longer self-commuting. Moreover, the time evolution now depends on the carrier phase such that, in general, every operation in a sequence of gates is different. In this work, we derive and verify a correction to the drive pulses that minimizes the effect of these counter-rotating terms in a two-level system. We then derive a second correction term that arises from non-computational levels for a strongly anharmonic system. We experimentally implement these correction terms on a fluxonium superconducting qubit, which is an example of a strongly anharmonic, low-frequency qubit for which the RWA may not hold, and demonstrate how fast, high-fidelity single-qubit gates can be achieved without the need for additional hardware complexities.</description>

      <title>Geometric quantum drives: Hyperbolically driven quantum systems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometrical construction of driven quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in a time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian with a structured temporal profile and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We explain how our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally novel classes of quantum dynamics: by steering a quantum Hamiltonian using a classical particle freely moving on a compact 2d hyperbolic Riemann surface called the Bolza surface, we demonstrate an example of a hyperbolically driven quantum system. We show that fully gapped hyperbolically driven quantum systems in the adiabatic limit are topologically classified by a quantized dynamical response. We propose geometric quantum driving to be a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems, which can be realized with time-dependent controls available in modern day quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bragg microcavities in collisions of unipolar light pulses of unusual shape in two- and three-level medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unipolar light pulses with a non-zero electric area due to the unidirectional action on charged particles can be used for the ultrafast control of the properties of quantum systems. To control atomic properties in an efficient way, it is necessary to vary the temporal shape of the pulses used. This has led to the problem of obtaining pulses of an unusual shape, such as a rectangular one. A number of new phenomena, not possible with conventional multi-cycle pulses, were discovered by analyzing the interaction of such unipolar pulses with matter. These include the formation of dynamic microcavities at each resonant transition of a multilevel medium when such pulses collide with the medium. In this work, we compare the behavior of dynamic microcavities in a two-level and a three-level medium when unipolar pulses of unusual shape (rectangular) are collided with the medium. We do this on the basis of the numerical solution of the system for the density matrix of the medium and the wave equation for the electric field. Medium parameters correspond to atomic hydrogen. It is shown that for rectangular pulses in a three-level medium, the dynamics of the cavities can be very different from the two-level model, as opposed to pulses of other shapes (e.g. Gaussian shape). When the third level of the medium is taken into account, the self-induced transparency-like regime disappears. Differences in the dynamics of resonators in a three-level medium are revealed when the pulses behave like 2{\pi} pulses of self-induced transparency.</description>

      <title>Challenging the Quantum Advantage Frontier with Large-Scale Classical Simulations of Annealing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations of D-Wave's annealing-based quantum simulators have established new benchmarks for quantum computational advantage [arXiv:2403.00910]. However, the precise location of the classical-quantum computational frontier remains an open question, as classical simulation strategies continue to evolve. Here, we demonstrate that time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (t-VMC) with a physically motivated Jastrow-Feenberg wave function can efficiently simulate the quantum annealing of spin glasses up to system sizes previously thought to be intractable. Our approach achieves accuracy comparable to that of quantum processing units while requiring only polynomially scaling computational resources, in stark contrast to entangled-limited tensor network methods that scale exponentially. For systems up to 128 spins on a three-dimensional diamond lattice, we maintain correlation errors below 7%, which match or exceed the precision of existing quantum hardware. Rigorous assessments of residual energies and time-dependent variational principle errors establish clear performance benchmarks for classical simulations. These findings substantially shift the quantum advantage frontier and underscore that classical variational techniques, which are not fundamentally constrained by entanglement growth, remain competitive at larger system sizes than previously anticipated.</description>

      <title>Enhanced detection of quantum correlations via extracted work for quantum illumination and secure communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the measurement of two-mode quantum correlations in the context of quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum illumination (QI) through the detection of extracted work. We first observe that the extracted work, in units of $k_B T$, is identical for a two-mode squeezed thermal state (TMSTS) and a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSVS). However, TMSTS exhibits $\bar{n}_{\rm th}$ times greater resistance to channel noise compared to TMSVS. We demonstrate that using TMSTS enhances the extracted work, joint-detection signal-to-noise ratio in QI, and correlation coefficients for QKD by approximately $\bar{n}_{\rm th}$ times relative to initializing the idler-signal system with a TMSVS. These findings highlight the potential of TMSTS for improving correlation detection in quantum protocols, with significant implications for noise resilience in QI and QKD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems under continuous weak measurement follow stochastic differential equations (SDE). Depending on the stochastic measurement results indeed, the quantum state can progressively diffuse, a priori in all directions of state space. This note draws attention to the observation that, in several settings of interest for quantum engineering, this diffusion in fact takes place in low dimension. Namely, the state remains confined in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, often time-dependent, but independent of the measurement results. The note provides the corresponding low-dimensional expressions for computing the stochastically evolving state in several such settings: quantum non-demolition measurement in arbitrary dimensions; quadrature measurements on a harmonic oscillator (linear quantum system); and subsystem measurement in multi-partite quantum systems. An algebraic criterion is proposed to directly check when such low-dimensional manifolds exist or survive under additional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy Scale Degradation in Sparse Quantum Solvers: A Barrier to Quantum Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a promising route for tackling hard optimization problems by encoding them as Ising models. However, sparse qubit connectivity requires the use of minor-embedding, mapping logical qubits onto chains of physical qubits, which necessitates stronger intra-chain coupling to maintain consistency. This elevated coupling strength forces a rescaling of the Hamiltonian due to hardware-imposed limits on the allowable ranges of coupling strengths, reducing the energy gaps between competing states, thus, degrading the solver's performance. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that quantifies this degradation. We show that as the connectivity degree increases, the effective temperature rises as a polynomial function, resulting in a success probability that decays exponentially. Our analysis further establishes worst-case bounds on the energy scale degradation based on the inverse conductance of chain subgraphs, revealing two most important drivers of chain strength, \textit{chain volume} and \textit{chain connectivity}. Our findings indicate that achieving quantum advantage is inherently challenging. Experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers validate these findings, highlighting the need for hardware with improved connectivity and optimized scale-aware embedding algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel optomechanical gyroscope architecture based on a spinning cavity optomechanical resonator (COM) evanescently coupled to a tapered optical fiber without relying on costly quantum light sources. Our study reveals a striking dependence of the gyroscope's sensitivity on the propagation direction of the driving optical field, manifesting robust quantum non-reciprocal behavior. This non-reciprocity significantly enhances the precision of angular velocity estimation, offering a unique advantage over conventional gyroscopic systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the operational range of this non-reciprocal gyroscope is fundamentally governed by the frequency of the pumping optical field, enabling localized sensitivity to angular velocity. Leveraging the adaptive capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL), we optimize the gyroscope's sensitivity within a targeted angular velocity range, achieving unprecedented levels of precision. These results highlight the transformative potential of RL in advancing high-resolution, miniaturized optomechanical gyroscopes, opening new avenues for next-generation inertial sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a macroscopic quantum state must be pinned down in order to assess how well experiments probe the large-scale limits of quantum mechanics. However, the issue of quantifying so-called quantum macroscopicity is fraught with multiple approaches having varying interpretations and levels of computability and measurability. Here, we introduce two measures that capture independent macroscopic properties: i) extensive size, measuring the degree of coherence in position or momentum observables relative to atomic-scale units, and ii) entangled size, quantifying the number of entangled subsystems. These measures unify many desirable features of past proposals while having rigorously justified interpretations from quantum information theory in terms of coherence and multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate how to estimate them and obtain lower-bounds using experimental data from micro-mechanical oscillators and diffracting molecules. Notably, we find evidence for genuine multipartite entanglement of $10^6$ to $10^7$ atoms in recent mechanical superposition states.</description>

Abstract: The NP-hardness of the closest vector problem (CVP) is an important basis for quantum-secure cryptography, in much the same way that integer factorisation's conjectured hardness is at the foundation of cryptosystems like RSA. Recent work with heuristic quantum algorithms (arXiv:2212.12372) indicates the possibility to find close approximations to (constrained) CVP instances that could be incorporated within fast sieving approaches for factorisation. This work explores both the practicality and scalability of the proposed heuristic approach to explore the potential for a quantum advantage for approximate CVP, without regard for the subsequent factoring claims. We also extend the proposal to include an antecedent "pre-training" scheme to find and fix a set of parameters that generalise well to increasingly large lattices, which both optimises the scalability of the algorithm, and permits direct numerical analyses. Our results further indicate a noteworthy quantum speed-up for lattice problems obeying a certain `prime' structure, approaching fifth order advantage for QAOA of fixed depth p=10 compared to classical brute-force, motivating renewed discussions about the necessary lattice dimensions for quantum-secure cryptosystems in the near-term.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of Dirac exceptional point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy level degeneracies, also known as exceptional points (EPs), are crucial for comprehending emerging phenomena in materials and enabling innovative functionalities for devices. Since EPs were proposed over half a century age, only two types of EPs have been experimentally discovered, revealing intriguing phases of materials such as Dirac and Weyl semimetals. These discoveries have showcased numerous exotic topological properties and novel applications, such as unidirectional energy transfer. Here we report the observation of a novel type of EP, named the Dirac EP, utilizing a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Two of the eigenvalues are measured to be degenerate at the Dirac EP and remain real in its vicinity. This exotic band topology associated with the Dirac EP enables the preservation of the symmetry when passing through, and makes it possible to achieve adiabatic evolution in non-Hermitian systems. We examined the degeneracy between the two eigenstates by quantum state tomography, confirming that the degenerate point is a Dirac EP rather than a Hermitian degeneracy. Our research of the distinct type of EP contributes a fresh perspective on dynamics in non-Hermitian systems and is potentially valuable for applications in quantum control in non-Hermitian systems and the study of the topological properties of EP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08449v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational method to automatically design the n-qubit realisations of quantum algorithms. Our approach leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) that enables the construction of quantum circuits via modular building blocks, making it well-suited for evolutionary search. In this DSL quantum circuits are abstracted beyond the usual gate-sequence description and scale automatically to any problem size. This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms--the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover's search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces. Convergence to the relevant algorithm is achieved with high probability and with moderate computational resources.</description>

      <title>Composably Secure Delegated Quantum Computation with Weak Coherent Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure Delegated Quantum Computation (SDQC) protocols allow a client to delegate a quantum computation to a powerful remote server while ensuring the privacy and the integrity of its computation. Recent resource-efficient and noise-robust protocols led to experimental proofs of concept. Yet, their physical requirements are still too stringent to be added directly to the roadmap of quantum hardware vendors. To address part of this issue, this paper shows how to alleviate the necessity for the client to have a single-photon source. It proposes a protocol that ensures that, among a sufficiently large block of transmitted weak coherent pulses, at least one of them was emitted as a single photon. This can then be used through quantum privacy amplification techniques to prepare a single secure qubit to be used in an SDQC protocol. As such, the obtained guarantee can also be used for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) where the privacy amplification step is classical. In doing so, it proposes a workaround for a weakness in the security proof of the decoy state method. The simplest instantiation of the protocol with only 2 intensities already shows improved scaling at low transmittance and adds verifiability to previous SDQC proposals.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions of heat equation on unitary groups establish an improved relation between $\epsilon$-nets and approximate unitary $t$-designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of $\epsilon$-nets and unitary ($\delta$-approximate) $t$-designs are important and ubiquitous across quantum computation and information. Both notions are closely related and the quantitative relations between $t$, $\delta$ and $\epsilon$ find applications in areas such as (non-constructive) inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev like theorems and random quantum circuits. In recent work, quantitative relations have revealed the close connection between the two constructions, with $\epsilon$-nets functioning as unitary $\delta$-approximate $t$-designs and vice-versa, for appropriate choice of parameters. In this work we improve these results, significantly increasing the bound on the $\delta$ required for a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design to form an $\epsilon$-net from $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon^{3/2}/d\right)^{d^2}$ to $\delta \simeq \left(\epsilon/d^{1/2}\right)^{d^2}$. We achieve this by constructing polynomial approximations to the Dirac delta using heat kernels on the projective unitary group $\mathrm{PU}(d) \cong\mathbf{U}(d)$, whose properties we studied and which may be applicable more broadly. We also outline the possible applications of our results in quantum circuit overheads, quantum complexity and black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tripartite Coupling of Single Electrons on Solid Neon with Magnons in a Hybrid Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent nonlinear tripartite interactions are critical for advancing quantum simulation and information processing in hybrid quantum systems, yet they remain experimentally challenging and still evade comprehensive exploration. Here, we predict a nonlinear tripartite coupling mechanism in a hybrid setup comprising a single electron trapped on a solid neon surface and a nearby micromagnet. The tripartite coupling here leverages the electron's intrinsic charge (motional) and spin degrees of freedom interacting with the magnon modes of the micromagnet. Thanks to the large spatial extent of the electron zero-point motion, we show that it is possible to obtain a tunable and strong spin-magnon-motion coupling at the single quantum level, with two phonons simultaneously interacting with a single spin and magnon excitation. This enables, for example, dissipative interactions between the electron's charge and spin degrees of freedom, permitting controlled phonon addition/subtraction in the electron's motional state and the preparation of steady-state non-Gaussian motional states. This protocol can be readily implemented with the well-developed techniques in electron traps and may open new avenues for general applications in quantum simulations and information processing based on strongly coupled hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Quantum Entanglement and Indistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the entanglement of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles, introducing a new error model for Hardy's test, experimentally verified using superconducting qubits. We address challenges in implementing quantum protocols based on this test and propose potential solutions and present two performance measures for qubits in superconducting quantum computers. We demonstrate that if quantum particles can create hyper-hybrid entangled states and achieve unit fidelity quantum teleportation, arbitrary state cloning is possible. This leads to two no-go theorems: hyper-hybrid entangled states cannot be formed with distinguishable particles, and unit fidelity quantum teleportation is unattainable with indistinguishable particles. These results establish unique correlations for each particle type, creating a clear distinction between the two domains. We also show that hyper-hybrid entangled states can be formed with indistinguishable fermions and generalize this for both fermions and bosons. We develop a generalized DoF trace-out rule applicable to single or multiple degrees of freedom for both types of particles. This framework allows us to derive expressions for teleportation fidelity and singlet fraction, establishing an upper bound for the generalized singlet fraction. We present an optical circuit that generates entanglement in distinguishable particles. Using our trace-out rule, we show that for two indistinguishable particles with multiple DoFs, the monogamy of entanglement can be maximally violated. We assert that indistinguishability is essential for this violation in qubit systems. For three indistinguishable particles, we confirm that monogamy is upheld using squared concurrence. Finally, we propose a novel entanglement swapping protocol involving two indistinguishable particles, enhancing quantum networks and quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Mitigating transients in flux-control signals in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux-tunable qubits and couplers are common components in superconducting quantum processors. However, dynamically controlling these elements via current pulses poses challenges due to distortions and transients in the propagating signals. In particular, long-time transients can persist, adversely affecting subsequent qubit control operations. We model the flux control line as a first-order RC circuit and introduce a class of pulses designed to mitigate long-time transients. We theoretically demonstrate the robustness of these pulses against parameter mischaracterization and provide experimental evidence of their effectiveness in mitigating transients when applied to a flux-tunable qubit coupler. The proposed pulse design offers a practical solution for mitigating long-time transients, enabling efficient and reliable experiment tune-ups without requiring detailed flux line characterization.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Neural Network Transfer-Learning Model for Forecasting Problems with Continuous and Discrete Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a continuous-variable quantum neural network (CV-QNN) model designed as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting problems. The proposed quantum technique features a simple structure with only eight trainable parameters, a single quantum layer with two wires to create entanglement, and ten quantum gates, hence the name QNNet10, effectively mimicking the functionality of classical neural networks. A notable aspect is that the quantum network achieves high accuracy with random initialization after a single iteration. This pretrained model is innovative as it requires no training or parameter tuning when applied to new datasets, allowing for parameter freezing while enabling the addition of a final layer for fine-tuning. Additionally, an equivalent discrete-variable quantum neural network (DV-QNN) is presented, structured similarly to the CV model. However, analysis shows that the two-wire DV model does not significantly enhance performance. As a result, a four-wire DV model is proposed, achieving comparable results but requiring a larger and more complex structure with additional gates. The pretrained model is applied to five forecasting problems of varying sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Transforming Traditional Neural Networks into Neuromorphic Quantum-Cognitive Models: A Tutorial with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are increasingly pervasive, underpinning the operation of numerous electronic, optical and medical devices. Today, we are also witnessing rapid advancements in quantum computing and communication. However, access to quantum technologies in computation remains largely limited to professionals in research organisations and high-tech industries. This paper demonstrates how traditional neural networks can be transformed into neuromorphic quantum models, enabling anyone with a basic understanding of undergraduate-level machine learning to create quantum-inspired models that mimic the functioning of the human brain -- all using a standard laptop. We present several examples of these quantum machine learning transformations and explore their potential applications, aiming to make quantum technology more accessible and practical for broader use. The examples discussed in this paper include quantum-inspired analogues of feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, Echo State Network reservoir computing and Bayesian neural networks, demonstrating that a quantum approach can both optimise the training process and equip the models with certain human-like cognitive characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $^4$He nanodroplets doped with an alkali ion feature a snowball of crystallized layers surrounded by superfluid helium. For large droplets, we predict that a transitional supersolid layer can form, bridging between the solid core and the liquid bulk, where the $^4$He density displays modulations of icosahedral group symmetry. To identify the different phases, we combine density functional theory with the semiclassical Gaussian time-dependent Hartree method for localized many-body systems. This hybrid approach can handle large particle numbers and provides insight into the physical origin of the supersolid layer. For small droplets, we verify that the predictions of our approach are in excellent agreement with Path-Integral Monte Carlo calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is crucial for advancing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving R\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted R\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Heat-to-motion conversion for quantum active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an active quantum particle and discuss its properties. The particle has a set of internal states that mediate exchanges of heat with external reservoirs. Heat is then converted into motion by means of a spin-orbit term that couples internal and translational degrees of freedom. The quantum features of the active particle manifest both in the motion and in the heat-to-motion conversion. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of heat exchanges impacts the motion of the active particle and fluctuations can be orders of magnitude larger than the average values. The combination of spin-orbit interaction under nonequilibrium driving may bring active matter into the realm of cold atomic gases where our proposal can be implemented.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Decoding of Classical Coset Codes over $3-$User Quantum Interference Channel : New Achievable Rate Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for arbitrary high-spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal parameter-free quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than $1/2$) Hamiltonians. This approach extends a previously developed method by the authors for spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice. Additionally, we detail how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>First principal investigation of Structural optical and thermoelectric properties of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ compound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural, thermoelectric, and optical properties of $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ were studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the ABINIT code. The GGA-PBE functional, plane wave pseudopotentials, a kinetic energy cutoff of $35Ha$, and an 11x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack $k$-point grid were employed. The material comprises inorganic $[CdCl_4]^{2-}$ sheets, organic $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]^{2+}$ layers, and $N-H-Cl$ hydrogen bonds, ensuring sublattice cohesion. Structural optimization used reference crystal data, enabling analysis of alkylene-diammonium chain conformation, intermolecular interactions, and crystal stability. The study highlights the role of $Cd$ in influencing optical and thermoelectric properties. Temperature-induced changes lead to a reduced band gap and enhanced optical absorption, indicating significant electronic structure modifications. These findings propose $[NH_3-(CH_2)_4-NH_3]CdCl_4$ as a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications, particularly after thermal cycling, due to its improved performance under varying conditions.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-preserving and transferable representation for learning the Kohn-Sham density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham (KS) density matrix is one of the most essential properties in KS density functional theory (DFT), from which many other physical properties of interest can be derived. In this work, we present a parameterized representation for learning the mapping from a molecular configuration to its corresponding density matrix using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework, which preserves the physical symmetries of the mapping, including isometric equivariance and Grassmannianity. Trained on several typical molecules, the proposed representation is shown to be systematically improvable with the increase of the model parameters and is transferable to molecules that are not part of and even more complex than those in the training set. The models generated by the proposed approach are illustrated as being able to generate reasonable predictions of the density matrix to either accelerate the DFT calculations or to provide approximations to some properties of the molecules.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop 5T-SRIS, an improved 5T myocardial T1 mapping method based on MOLLI, which addresses limitations in inversion efficiency, readout perturbations, and imperfect magnetization recovery. Methods: The proposed 5T-SRIS method is based on a modified 5-(3)-3 MOLLI sequence with ECG gating and gradient echo readout. To improve inversion efficiency at 5T, the inversion pulse was redesigned using adiabatic hyperbolic secant (HSn) and tangent/hyperbolic tangent (Tan/Tanh) pulses. Signal evolution was modeled recursively with inversion efficiency and a correction factor (C) to correct inversion imperfections, and T1 values were estimated via nonlinear optimization. The method was validated in phantom studies, as well as in 21 healthy volunteers and 9 patients at 5T. Results: The optimized IR pulse based on the tangent/hyperbolic tangent pulse was found to outperform the conventional hyperbolic secant IR pulse at the 5T scanner. This optimized IR pulse achieves an average inversion factor of 0.9014within a B0 range of 250Hz and a B1 range of -50% to 20%. Phantom studies show that the 5T-SRIS achieved high accuracy with errors within 5%. In vivo studies with 21 healthy volunteers, the native myocardial T1 values were 1468 ms (apex), 1514 ms (middle), and 1545 ms (base). In vivo studies with 9 heart patients, the native myocardial T1 values were 1484 ms (apex), 1532 ms (middle), and 1581 ms (base). And the post myocardial T1 values were 669 ms (apex), 698 ms (middle), and 675 ms (base). Conclusion: The 5T-SRIS technique is robust and suitable for clinical cardiac imaging. This study demonstrates its feasibility for accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T, despite challenges related to magnetic field inhomogeneity.

      <title>Fully numerical Hartree-Fock Calculations with Quantized Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully numerical framework for the optimization of molecule-specific quantum chemical basis functions within the quantics tensor train format using a finite-difference scheme. The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.</description>

      <title>Superkick Effect in Vortex Particle Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex states of photons or electrons are a novel and promising experimental tool across atomic, nuclear, and particle physics. Various experimental schemes to generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed. However, diagnosing the characteristics of vortex states at high energies remains a significant challenge, as traditional low-energy detection schemes become impractical for high-energy vortex particles due to their extremely short de Broglie wavelength. We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme based on a mechanism called "superkick" that is free from many drawbacks of the traditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this paper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the superkick effect in elastic electron scattering and systematically investigate the impact of various factors on its visibility. In particular, we argue that the vortex phase can be identified either by detecting the two scattered electrons in coincidence or by analyzing the characteristic azimuthal asymmetry in individual final particles.</description>

      <title>Non-magnetic Fractional Conductance in High Mobility InAs Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we report the magneto-electronic properties of high mobility InAs quantum point contacts grown on InP substrates. The 1D conductance reaches a maximum value of 17 plateaus, quantized in units of 2e^2/h, where e is the fundamental unit of charge and h is Planck's constant. The in-plane effective g-factor was estimated to be -10.9 +/- 1.5 for subband N = 1 and -10.8 +/- 1.6 for subband N = 2. Furthermore, a study of the non-magnetic fractional conductance states at 0.2 (e^2/h) and 0.1(e2/h is provided. While their origin remains under discussion, evidence suggests that they arise from strong electron-electron interactions and momentum-conserving backscattering between electrons in two distinct channels within the 1D region. This phenomenon may also be interpreted as an entanglement between the two channel directions facilitated by momentum-conserving backscattering.</description>

      <title>Density matrices in quantum field theory: Non-Markovianity, path integrals and master equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrices are powerful mathematical tools for the description of closed and open quantum systems. Recently, methods for the direct computation of density matrix elements in scalar quantum field theory were developed based on thermo field dynamics (TFD) and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this article, we provide a more detailed discussion of these methods and derive expressions for density matrix elements of closed and open systems. At first, we look at closed systems by discussing general solutions to the Schr\"odinger-like form of the quantum Liouville equations in TFD, showing that the dynamical map is indeed divisible, deriving a path integral-based expression for the density matrix elements in Fock space, and explaining why perturbation theory enables us to use the last even in situations where all initial states in Fock space are occupied. Subsequently, we discuss open systems in the same manner after tracing out environmental degrees of freedom from the solutions for closed systems. We find that, even in a general basis, the dynamical map is not divisible, which renders the dynamics of open systems non-Markovian. Finally, we show how the resulting expressions for open systems can be used to obtain quantum master equations, and comment on the artificiality of time integrals over density matrices that usually appear in many other master equations in the literature but are absent in ours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.13934v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-time quantum processes are endowed with the same richness as multipartite states, including temporal entanglement and exotic causal structures. However, experimentally probing these rich phenomena leans heavily on fast and clean mid-circuit measurements, which are rarely available. We show here how surprisingly accessible these phenomena are in nascent quantum processors even when faced with substantially limited control. We work within the limitation where only unitary control is allowed, followed by a terminating measurement. Within this setting, we first develop a witness for genuine multi-time entanglement, and then methods to bound (from top and bottom) multi-time entanglement, non-Markovianity, purity, entropy, and other correlative measures. Our tools are designed to be implemented on quantum information processors, which we proceed to demonstrate. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods by testing them across random multi-time processes. Conceptually, this broadens our understanding of the extent to which temporal correlations may be determined with only deterministic control. Our techniques are pertinent to generic quantum stochastic dynamical processes, with a scope ranging across condensed matter physics, quantum biology, and in-depth diagnostics of NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Recursive Variational Quantum Compiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithms aim to approximate deep quantum circuits with shallow parameterized ansatzes, making them more suitable for NISQ hardware. In this article a variant of VQC named the recursive variational quantum compiling (RVQC) algorithm is proposed. Existing VQC algorithms typically require coherently executing the full circuit during compilation. Under the influence of noise, sufficiently deep target circuits make compiling unfeasible using ordinary VQC. Since the compiling is often accomplished using a gradient-based quantum-classical approach, the quantum noise manifest as a noisy gradient during optimization, making convergence hard to obtain. On the other hand, RVQC can compile a circuit by first dividing it into $N$ shorter sub-circuits, then evaluate one sub-circuit at a time. As a result, the circuit depth required to implement RVQC is not dependent on the depth of the target circuit, but on the depth of the sub-circuits. Choosing a high enough $N$ thus ensures sufficiently shallow sub-circuit which can be successfully compiled individually. We show mathematical evidence of this property. RVQC was compared with VQC on a noise model of the IBM Santiago device with the goal of compiling several randomly generated five-qubit circuits of approximately depth 1000. It was shown that VQC was not able to converge within 500 iterations of optimization. On the other hand, RVQC was able to converge to a fidelity of $0.90 \pm 0.05$ within a total of 500 iterations when splitting the target circuits into $N = 5$ parts. We argue that this comes as a result of the mitigation of noise-induced barren plateaus.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a spin-based receiver to sensitively detect the electric fields of millimeter (mm) waves by using quantum interferometric approach. The proposed quantum sensor consists of many surface-state electrons trapped individually on liquid helium by an electrode-network at the bottom of the liquid helium film. A dc-current in this chip is biased to generate a strong spin-orbit coupling of each of the trapped electrons. The mm wave signals are conducted to non-dissipatedly drive the orbital motions of the trapped electrons and result in the Stark shifts of the spin-orbit dressed states of the electrons. As a consequence, the electric fields of the conducted mm waves could be detected sensitively by using the Hahn echo interferometry with the long-lived spin states of the electrons trapped on liquid helium.</description>

      <title>Systematic Computation of Braid Generator Matrix in Topological Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive systematic method for the numerical computation of elementary braid operations in topological quantum computation (TQC). This {procedure} is systematically applicable to all anyon models, including $SU(2)_k$. Braiding non-abelian anyons is the essence of TQC, offering a topologically protected implementation of quantum gates. However, obtaining elementary braid matrix representations starting from the fusion and rotation matrices of a specific anyon model is {theoretically guarenteed but no numerical method is given, especially for systems with numerous anyons and complex fusion patterns. Our proposed method addresses this challenge, first in the special case of sparse encoding, allowing for the inclusion of an arbitrary number of anyons per qudit, {and in the general case}. This is accomplished by introducing two methods, one is based on a novel braiding move we call knitting, {the second introduces more general algorithm which is optimal in number of required moves}. The method plays a key role in a broad topological quantum circuit simulator, enabling the examination and study of complex quantum circuits within the TQC framework. Importantly, it proves effective across various anyonic models, accommodating diverse fusion rules. We validate the method by simulating an approximated CNOT gate and present a first-of-a-kind GHZ state simulation on five qubits using three Fibonacci anyons per qubit.</description>

      <title>Reversible tuning of nanowire quantum dot to atomic transitions</title>

Abstract: Quantum dots embedded in semiconductor photonic nanowires (NW-QDs) can deterministically produce single-photons and entangled photon pairs at high repetition rates. These photons can be efficiently coupled from the photonic nanowire into free space or optical fibers thanks to the sharp tip of the nanowire, which provides impedance matching. However, precise control of the NW-QD emission frequency in a way that is reversible, does not degrade the properties of the emitted photons, and can be used independently for individual NW-QDs on the same chip has so far remained a challenge. Resolving this issue is crucial for applications when interfacing the photons with quantum systems that require MHz to sub-GHz precision, such as atomic ensembles acting as memories in a quantum network. Here, we demonstrate a reversible tuning method that can tune the emission frequency of a NW-QD by more than 300 GHz with sub-GHz precision. We achieve this through gas condensation that is then partially reversed with localized laser ablation. This process finely adjusts stress applied to the quantum dots, thereby tuning their emission frequency. We validate the precision and stability of this method by tuning the frequency of the emitted single-photons across an atomic resonance to probe its absorption and dispersion. We observed up to 80\% absorption of the single-photons from NW-QD in hot caesium vapour at the D1-line resonances and a 75-fold decrease in group velocity associated with the hyperfine transitions of the D1-line ground states. We observed no discernible effects in the second-order autocorrelation function, lifetime, or linewidth of the NW-QD emission for up to 300 GHz of tuning and we saw minimal effects on the fine structure splitting of the NW-QD when tuning up to 100 GHz.</description>

      <title>How (Not) to Understand Weak Measurements of Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To-date, the most elaborated attempt to complete quantum mechanics by the addition of hidden variables is the de Broglie-Bohm (pilot wave) theory (dBBT). It endows particles with definite positions at all times. Their evolution is governed by a deterministic dynamics. By construction, however, the individual particle trajectories generically defy detectability in principle. Of late, this lore might seem to have been called into question in light of so-called weak measurements. Due to their characteristic weak coupling between the measurement device and the system under study, they permit the experimental probing of quantum systems without essentially disturbing them. It's natural therefore to think that weak measurements of velocity in particular offer to actually observe the particle trajectories. If true, such a claim would not only experimentally demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics: it would provide support of dBBT in its standard form, singling it out from an infinitude of empirically equivalent alternative choices for the particle dynamics. Here we examine this possibility. Our result is deflationary: weak velocity measurements constitute no new arguments, let alone empirical evidence, in favour of standard dBBT; One mustn't na\"ively identify weak and actual positions. Weak velocity measurements admit of a straightforward standard quantum mechanical interpretation, independent of any commitment to particle trajectories and velocities. This is revealed by a careful reconstruction of the physical arguments on which the description of weak velocity measurements rests. It turns out that for weak velocity measurements to be reliable, one must already presuppose dBBT in its standard form: in this sense, they can provide no new argument, empirical or otherwise, for dBBT and its standard guidance equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer-Based Verification of Quantum Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal fundamental trade-offs between precision and thermodynamic quantities, yet their empirical verification remains limited. We present an approach using quantum computers to verify a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our method, which implements quantum dynamics on physical qubits, enables us to investigate the measurability of relevant quantities, the relation's validity under physical noise, and its empirical tightness. Specifically, quantum computers' versatility allows for the examination of arbitrary observables. We address current quantum processor limitations through a three-fold strategy: generalizing the relation to generic observables under arbitrary quantum channels, proposing a method to measure the target thermodynamic quantity (survival activity) in the weak coupling regime, and reducing circuit depth by leveraging relation properties. Demonstrations on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor validate our relation in open qubit systems and achieve saturation with an optimal observable requiring entangled measurements. The relation is further verified in a quantum time correlator measurement protocol, confirming the broad applicability of our method. This study highlights the potential of noisy quantum computers for demonstrating quantum thermodynamic trade-offs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer a theoretical perspective on simulation and engineering of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven singlet-fission (SF) materials. We begin by examining fundamental models, including Tavis-Cummings and Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonians, exploring how disorder, non-Hermitian effects, and finite temperature conditions impact their dynamics, setting the stage for studying conical intersections and their crucial role in SF. Using rubrene as an example and applying the numerically accurate Davydov-Ansatz methodology, we derive dynamic and spectroscopic responses of the system and demonstrate key mechanisms capable of SF manipulation, viz. cavity-induced enhancement/weakening/suppression of SF, population localization on the singlet state via engineering of the cavity-mode excitation, polaron/polariton decoupling, collective enhancement of SF. We outline unsolved problems and challenges in the field, and share our views on the development of the future lines of research. We emphasize the significance of careful modeling of cascades of polaritonic conical intersections in high excitation manifolds and envisage that collective geometric phase effects may remarkably affect the SF dynamics and yield. We argue that microscopic interpretation of the main regulatory mechanisms of polaritonic conical-intersection-driven SF can substantially deepen our understanding of this process, thereby providing novel ideas and solutions for improving conversion efficiency in photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>PAC-learning of free-fermionic states is NP-hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as matchgates or Gaussian states, are a fundamental class of quantum states due to their efficient classical simulability and their crucial role across various domains of Physics. With the advent of quantum devices, experiments now yield data from quantum states, including estimates of expectation values. We establish that deciding whether a given dataset, formed by a few Majorana correlation functions estimates, can be consistent with a free-fermionic state is an NP-complete problem. Our result also extends to datasets formed by estimates of Pauli expectation values. This is in stark contrast to the case of stabilizer states, where the analogous problem can be efficiently solved. Moreover, our results directly imply that free-fermionic states are computationally hard to properly PAC-learn, where PAC-learning of quantum states is a learning framework introduced by Aaronson. Remarkably, this is the first class of classically simulable quantum states shown to have this property.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing: A Paradigm for Optimization in an Open Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern quantum technologies using matter are designed as closed quantum systems to isolate them from interactions with the environment. This design paradigm greatly constrains the scalability and limits practical implementation of such systems. Here, we introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-commutative polynomial optimization (NPO) problems seek to minimize the state average of a polynomial of some operator variables, subject to polynomial constraints, over all states and operators, as well as the Hilbert spaces where those might be defined. Many of these problems are known to admit a complete hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. In this work, we consider a variant of NPO problems where a subset of the operator variables satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations. We find that, under mild conditions of operator boundedness, for every such problem one can construct a standard NPO problem with the same solution. This allows us to define a complete hierarchy of SDPs to tackle the original differential problem. We apply this method to bound averages of local observables in quantum spin systems subject to a Hamiltonian evolution (i.e., a quench). We find that, even in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many sites, low levels of the hierarchy provide very good approximations for reasonably long evolution times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum double models provide a natural framework for realising anyons by manipulating a lattice of qudits, which can be directly encoded in quantum simulators. In this work, we consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that give rise to $\mathbf{D}(\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method that demonstrates the non-commutativity of the braiding and fusion evolutions solely by utilising the operators that create and measure anyons. Furthermore, we provide a dense coding scheme where only two qudits are sufficient to determine the anyonic braiding and fusion matrices. The minimal resource requirement of our approach offers a viable blueprint for demonstrating the non-Abelian nature of anyons in various quantum platforms, including optical, atomic, and solid-state systems, where higher-spin states can be effectively encoded. This work represents a foundational step towards the realisation of non-Abelian quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: In the flavour of categorical quantum mechanics, we extend nonlocal games to allow quantum questions and answers, using quantum sets (special symmetric dagger Frobenius algebras) and the quantum functions of Musto, Reutter, and Verdon [arXiv:1711.07945]. Equations are presented using a diagrammatic calculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we extend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and synchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about synchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum graphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and connect its perfect (bi)strategies to quantum graph homomorphisms (isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games literature, except in the case of synchronicity.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We describe the smallest quantum error correcting (QEC) code to correct for amplitude-damping (AD) noise, namely, a 3-qubit code that corrects all the single-qubit damping errors. We generalize this construction to a family of codes that correct AD noise up to any fixed order of the damping strength. We underpin the fundamental connection between the structure of our codes and the noise structure, via a relaxed form of the Knill-Laflamme conditions, that are different from existing formulations of approximate QEC conditions. Although the recovery procedure for this code is non-deterministic, our codes are optimal with respect to overheads and outperform existing codes to tackle AD noise in terms of entanglement fidelity. This alternate formulation of approximate QEC further leads us to a new classes of quantum codes tailored to AD noise and also gives rise to a noise-adapted quantum Hamming bound for AD noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum computation, identifying key elements that enable a quantum computational advantage is a long-standing issue. Starting from the standard results on the necessity of Wigner negativity, we develop a comprehensive and versatile approach in which the techniques of $(s)$-ordered quasiprobabilities are exploited to identify the contribution of each quantum gate to the potential achievement of quantum computational advantage. This is achieved by means of an analysis of the so-called transfer function, allowing us to highlight the resourcefulness of a gate set. As such this technique can be straightforwardly applied to current continuous-variables quantum circuits, while also constraining the tolerable amount of losses above which any potential quantum advantage can be ruled out. We use $(s)$-ordered quasiprobability distributions on phase-space to capture the non-classical features in the protocol, and focus our technique entirely on the ordering parameter $s$. This allows us to highlight the resourcefulness and robustness to loss of a universal set of unitary gates comprising three distinct Gaussian gates, and a fourth one, the cubic gate, providing important insight on the role of non-Gaussianity.</description>

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a significant role in enhancing the sustainability of transportation systems. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by inadequate public charging infrastructure, particularly to support long-distance travel. Identifying optimal charging station locations in large transportation networks presents a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, as the search space grows exponentially with the number of potential charging station locations. This paper introduces a quantum search-based optimization algorithm designed to enhance the efficiency of solving this NP-hard problem for transportation networks. By leveraging quantum parallelism, amplitude amplification, and quantum phase estimation as a subroutine, the optimal solution is identified with a quadratic improvement in complexity compared to classical exact methods, such as branch and bound. The detailed design and complexity of a resource-efficient quantum circuit are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states in free boson systems: Random sampling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, ultrasensitive calorimeters have been proposed as a resource-efficient solution for multiplexed qubit readout in superconducting large-scale quantum processors. However, experiments demonstrating frequency multiplexing of these superconductor--normal--conductor--superconductor (SNS) sensors are are lacking in the literature. To this end, we present the design, fabrication, and operation of three SNS sensors with frequency-multiplexed input and probe circuits, all on a single chip. These devices have their probe frequencies in the range 150 MHz--200 MHz, which is well detuned from the heater frequencies of 4.4 GHz--7.6 GHz compatible with typical readout frequencies of superconducting qubits. Importantly, we show on-demand triggering of both individual and multiple low-noise SNS bolometers with very low cross talk. These experiments pave the way for multiplexed bolometric characterization and calorimetric readout of multiple qubits, a promising step in minimizing related resources such as the number of readout lines and microwave isolators in large-scale superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Configurable controlled teleportation using multipartite GHZ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a controlled quantum teleportation protocol for securely transferring an unknown $n$-qubit state from a sender to a receiver, under the supervision of $m$ controller participants. The protocol uses $n$ copies of an $m$-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state as the quantum resource. Message qubits can be distributed among participants to enhance security against targeted external attacks. Each intermediate party may hold at most one resource qubit, reducing the total number of resource qubits required. The sender selects the end receiver during protocol execution, ensuring anonymity and minimizing the risk of interception by an external eavesdropper. We assess the protocol's performance by calculating teleportation fidelities for various $m$ and $n$ values and visualize the quantum states through Hinton diagrams. The results confirm the protocol's effectiveness for secure quantum communication in multi-party settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for bit-flip error correction of Andreev spins that is protected by Kramers' degeneracy. Specifically, we show that a coupling network of linear inductors and Andreev spin qubits results in a static Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers of a bit-flip code. The electrodynamics of the many-body spin states also respect these stabilizers, and we show how reflectometry off a single coupled resonator can thereby accomplish their projective measurement. We further show how circuit-mediated spin couplings enable error correction operations and a complete set of single- and two-module logical quantum gates. The concept, which we dub the Ising molecule qubit (or Isene), is experimentally feasible and provides a path for compact noise-biased qubits.</description>

      <title>An ultra-compact deterministic source of maximally entangled photon pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an ultra-compact source of maximally entangled on-demand photon pairs. Our results are based on coupling of single GaAs quantum dots that are embedded in monolithic micro-lenses to a single-mode fiber with directly attached to 3D-printed micro-optics (NA of 0.6) inside a cryogenic environment. This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation. Utilizing the exciton-biexciton emission cascade available in GaAs quantum dots under resonant excitation, near maximally entangled photon pairs with peak entanglement negatives 2n of 0.96(2) in a 4 ps time window, and 0.81(1) when averaged over one exciton lifetime, are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Continuous-Wave Pumped Entanglement-based QKD in Noisy Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a promising solution to protect current cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computers. As QKD transitions from laboratories to real-world applications, its implementation under various environmental conditions has become a pressing challenge. Major obstacles to practical QKD implementation are the loss of photons in the transmission media and the presence of extreme noise, which can severely limit long-range transmission. In this paper, we investigate the impact of extreme noise on QKD system parameters, including detector timing uncertainty (jitter), measurement timing shifts, variations in detector deadtime, and rate-dependent detector efficiency. Contrary to manufacturers' specifications, which assume these parameters to be constant, we demonstrate that these parameters exhibit significant variations in extreme noise conditions. We show that changes in these parameters play a key role in determining system performance in noisy environments. To address these non-idealities, we develop a robust model that can address and adapt to various detector characteristics. In particular, our model is independent of source parameters and can be implemented using data from the detection unit. Our results show that our model is well suited for characterizing and optimizing the performance of the QKD system under noisy conditions.</description>

Abstract: The integration of quantum computers and sensors into a quantum network opens a new frontier for quantum information science. We demonstrate high-fidelity entanglement between ytterbium-171 atoms -- the basis for state-of-the-art atomic quantum processors and optical atomic clocks -- and optical photons directly generated in the telecommunication wavelength band where loss in optical fiber is minimal. We entangle the nuclear spin of the atom with a single photon in the time bin basis, and find an atom measurement-corrected (raw) atom-photon Bell state fidelity of $0.950(9)\pm0.005(3)_\text{bound}$ ($0.90(1)\pm0.014(3)_\text{bound}$). Photon measurement errors contribute $\approx0.037$ to our infidelity and can be removed with straightforward upgrades. Additionally, by imaging our atom array onto an optical fiber array, we demonstrate a parallelized networking protocol that can provide an $N$-fold boost in the remote entanglement rate. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to preserve coherence on a memory qubit while performing networking operations on communication qubits. Our work is a major step towards the integration of atomic processors and optical clocks into a high-rate or long-distance quantum network.</description>

      <title>A perturbation theory for multi-time correlation functions in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical maps are the principal subject of the open system theory. Formally, the dynamical map of a given open quantum system is a density matrix transformation that takes any initial state and sends it to the state at a later time. Physically, it encapsulates the system's evolution due to coupling with its environment.
  Hence, the theory provides a flexible and accurate framework for computing expectation values of open system observables. However, expectation values -- or more generally, single-time correlation functions -- capture only the simplest aspects of a quantum system's dynamics. A complete characterization requires access to multi-time correlation functions as well. For closed systems, such correlations are well-defined, even though knowledge of the system's state alone is insufficient to determine them fully. In contrast, the standard dynamical map formalism for open systems does not account for multi-time correlations, as it is fundamentally limited to describing state evolution. Here, we extend the scope of open quantum system theory by developing a systematic perturbation theory for computing multi-time correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Extension of the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation: Theorems and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation (LCHS) formula [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2023] to simulate time-evolution operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, including scenarios involving unbounded operators. This extension, named Inf-LCHS for short, bridges the gap between finite-dimensional quantum simulations and the broader class of infinite-dimensional quantum dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Furthermore, we propose two sampling methods by integrating the infinite-dimensional LCHS with Gaussian quadrature schemes (Inf-LCHS-Gaussian) or Monte Carlo integration schemes (Inf-LCHS-MC). We demonstrate the applicability of the Inf-LCHS theorem to a wide range of non-Hermitian dynamics, including linear parabolic PDEs, queueing models (birth-or-death processes), Schr\"odinger equations with complex potentials, Lindblad equations, and black hole thermal field equations. Our analysis provides insights into simulating general linear dynamics using a finite number of quantum dynamics and includes cost estimates for the corresponding quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum measurements are not deterministic. For this reason quantum measurements are repeated for a number of shots on identically prepared systems. The uncertainty in each measurement depends on the number of shots and the expected outcome of the measurement. This information can be used to improve the fitting of models to quantum measurements.
  In this paper we analyse ordinary-least squares, weighted least squares and maximum-likelihood estimation. We show that using the information on the quantum measurement uncertainty can lead to improved estimation of system parameters. We also introduce the concept of model violation and demonstrate it can be a valuable tool to analyze model assumptions and performance of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Observing the exponential growth of the eigenmodes in the absence of coalescence for a non-Hermitian circuit with an unavoidable inductor dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate, both experimentally and theoretically, the eigenmodes of an electronic circuit in which gain and loss $RLC$ resonators are coupled through a capacitor. Due to the unavoidable magnetic loss in the inductors, we find that the eigenmode coalescence no longer emerges in contrast to the conventional non-Hermitian systems with the spontaneous $\cal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. In particular, we find a transition from the exponential decay to exponential growth in the amplitude of the periodic voltage oscillations of the resonators. The transition occurs near the exceptional points of the non-Hermitian circuit without considering the dissipations in inductors. We introduce a small resistor of three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the $RLC$ resonators to mimic the energy dissipation in inductors and numerically solve the equivalent non-Hermitian Schr{\" o}dinger equation. The numerical results can well reproduce experimental observations. Our above findings unambiguously indicate that the exponential growth behavior beyond the exceptional points is robust against some unavoidable dissipative perturbations.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Real quantum systems can exhibit a local object called local partial density of states (LPDOS) that cannot be proved within the axiomatic approach of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that real mesoscopic system that can exhibit Fano resonances will show this object and also very counterintuitively it can become negative, resulting in the enhancement of coherent currents.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Holography via Quantum Coherence on Causal Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12080v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is much recent development towards interferometric measurements of holographic quantum uncertainties in an emergent background space-time. Despite increasing promise for the target detection regime of Planckian strain power spectral density, the foundational insights of the motivating theories have not been connected to a phenomenological model of observables measured in a realistic experiment. This work proposes a candidate model, based on the central hypothesis that all horizons are universal boundaries of coherent quantum information -- where the decoherence of space-time happens for the observer. The prediction is inspired by 't Hooft's algebra for black hole information that gives coherent states on horizons, whose spatial correlations were shown by Verlinde and Zurek to also appear on holographic fluctuations of causal boundaries in flat space-time (conformal Killing horizons). Time-domain correlations are projected from Planckian jitters whose coherence scales match causal diamonds, motivated by Banks' framework for the emergence of space-time and locality. The universality of this coherence on causal horizons compels a multimodal research program probing concordant signatures: An analysis of cosmological data to probe primordial correlations, motivated by Hogan's interpretation of well-known CMB anomalies as coherent fluctuations on the inflationary horizon, and upcoming 3D interferometers to probe causal diamonds in flat space-time. Candidate interferometer geometries are presented, with a modeled frequency spectrum for each design.</description>

      <title>Certificate Games and Consequences for the Classical Adversary Bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study Certificate Game complexity, a measure of complexity based on the probability of winning a game where two players are given inputs with different function values and are asked to output some index $i$ such that $x_i\neq y_i$, in a zero-communication setting.
  We study four versions of certificate games, namely private coin, public coin, shared entanglement and non-signaling games. The public-coin variant of certificate games gives a new characterization of the classical adversary bound, a lower bound on randomized query complexity which was introduced as a classical version of the quantum (non-negative) quantum adversary bound.
  We show that complexity in the public coin model (therefore also the classical adversary) is bounded above by certificate complexity, as well as by expectational certificate complexity and sabotage complexity. On the other hand, it is bounded below by fractional and randomized certificate complexity.
  The quantum measure reveals an interesting and surprising difference between classical and quantum query models: the quantum certificate game complexity can be quadratically larger than quantum query complexity. We use non-signaling, a notion from quantum information, to give a lower bound of $n$ on the quantum certificate game complexity of the OR function, whose quantum query complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, then go on to show that this ``non-signaling bottleneck'' applies to all functions with high sensitivity, block sensitivity, fractional block sensitivity, as well as classical adversary. This implies the collapse of all models of certificate games, except private randomness, to the classical adversary bound.
  We consider the single-bit version of certificate games, where the inputs of the two players are restricted to having Hamming distance 1, and give a new characterization of sensitivity and spectral sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a novel framework that integrates tensor-based operations into the attention mechanism, thereby enhancing both the expressivity and computational efficiency of deep neural networks. Our approach leverages the algebraic structure of tensor products to generalize the conventional dot-product attention and to formulate new operators, namely, Tensor Attention and Tensor Interaction, which capture higher-order token dependencies. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on the universal properties of tensor products, we demonstrate that our framework not only improves efficiency by reducing computational complexity but also offers a principled method for modeling complex interactions in sequential data. Empirical evaluations further substantiate that the proposed deep tensor network can serve as a robust building block for advancing state-of-the-art performance in various deep learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Interaction quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas is a highly correlated quantum state of strongly interacting bosons confined to one dimension, where repulsive interactions make the particles behave like impenetrable fermions. By suddenly tuning these interactions to the attractive regime, it is possible to realize a super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas -- a highly excited, metastable state of strongly attractive bosons with unique stability properties. Inspired by the sTG quench scenario, we investigate a similar setup but with the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions, which modify the system away from the TG Mott insulating limit. We simulate an interaction quench on dipolar bosons initially prepared in various states and fillings, using real-space densities, orbital occupations, Glauber correlation functions, and autocorrelation functions to probe post-quench stability. Our results reveal that stability is maintained only at very weak dipolar interaction strengths when starting from a unit-filled TG Mott state. In contrast, all cluster states -- whether unit-filled or doubly-filled -- eventually collapse under attractive interactions. This collapse is not always visible in the density profile but becomes apparent in the autocorrelation function, indicating complex many-body restructuring of the quantum state. Our findings underscore the potential of dipolar interactions to drive novel quantum dynamics and highlight the delicate balance required to stabilize excited states in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum state of fields in $SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity ($SU(\infty)$-QGR)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our Universe is ruled by quantum mechanics and should be treated as a quantum system. $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a recently proposed quantum model for the Universe, in which gravity is associated to $SU(\infty)$ symmetry of its Hilbert space. Fragmentation of its infinite dimensional state due to random quantum fluctuations divides the Universe to approximately isolated subsystems. In addition to parameters of their {\it internal} finite rank symmetries, states and dynamics of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters and the perceived classical spacetime is their effective representation, reflecting quantum states of subsystems and their relative evolution. At lowest order the effective Lagrangian of $SU(\infty)$-QGR~has the form of Yang-Mills gauge theories for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries defined on the aforementioned 4D parameter space. In the present work we study more thoroughly some of the fundamental aspects of $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Specifically, we clarify the impact of the degeneracies of $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$ algebra on the construction of the model; describe mixed states of subsystems and their purification; calculate measures of their entanglement to the rest of the Universe; and discuss their role in the emergence of local gauge symmetries. We also describe the relationship between what is called {\it internal space} of $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills with the 4D parameter space, and analytically demonstrate irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space for physical observables. Along with these topics, we demonstrate the equivalence of two sets of criteria for compositeness of a quantum system, and show uniqueness of the limit of various algebras leading to $\mathcal{SU}(\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Pulsed magnetic field gradient on a tip for nanoscale imaging of spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of the Ising model on a spherical Fibonacci lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Ising model on a spherical surface, utilizing a Fibonacci lattice to approximate uniform coverage. This setup poses challenges in achieving consistent lattice distribution across the sphere for comparison with planar models. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to study spin configurations across a range of temperatures and to determine phase transition temperatures. The Fibonacci lattice, despite its uniformity, contains irregular sites that influence spin behavior. In the ferromagnetic case, sites with fewer neighbors exhibit a higher tendency for spin flips at low temperatures, though this effect weakens as temperature increases, leading to a higher phase transition temperature than in the planar Ising model. In the antiferromagnetic case, lattice irregularities prevent the total energy from reaching its minimum at zero temperature, highlighting the role of curvature and connectivity in shaping interactions. Phase transition temperatures are derived through specific heat, magnetic susceptibility analysis and GCN predictions, yielding $T_c$ values for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic scenarios. This work emphasizes the impact of the Fibonacci lattice's geometric properties-namely curvature and connectivity-on spin interactions in non-planar systems, with relevance to microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Fermi Velocity Dependent Critical Current in Ballistic Bilayer Graphene Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L&gt;\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</description>

Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</description>

      <title>Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</description>
