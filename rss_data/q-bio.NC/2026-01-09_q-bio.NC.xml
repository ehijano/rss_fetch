      <title>Past Psychedelic Use Predicts Divergent Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychedelics have shown potential in treating a range of mental health conditions, yet far less is known about their impact on creativity. This study examined three components of creativity-divergent thinking, cognitive reflection, and insight in a large sample (N = 5,905) from the Great British Intelligence Test. We compared performance between individuals with past psychedelic use and those without such use. Psychedelic users scored significantly higher on divergent thinking than both non-drug users and drug users who had not used psychedelics. However, they did not score higher on measures of cognitive reflection, number of insights, or insight accuracy. These findings suggest that naturalistic psychedelic use may be associated with enhanced divergent thinking, but not enhanced insight-related performance. Future research should aim to establish causality through prospective designs and controlled studies incorporating long-term follow-up, biological data, and personality structure assessment.</description>

      <title>Effects of T-type and L-type calcium currents on synchronized activity patterns in a model subthalamo-pallidal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronized rhythmic oscillatory activity in the beta frequency band in the basal ganglia (BG) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent experiments and theoretical studies have demonstrated the crucial roles of T-type and L-type calcium currents in shaping the activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. However, the role of these currents in the generation of synchronized activity patterns in BG networks involving STN is still unknown. In this study, using an STN model incorporating T-type and L-type calcium currents, we examined how these currents shape the patterns of neural activity in the subthalamo-pallidal network, including network dynamics in response to periodic external inputs. The dynamics were studied in relation to the network connectivity parameters - modulated by dopamine (depleted in PD's BG) - and compared with the properties of the temporal patterning of synchronous neural activity previously observed in the experimental studies with Parkinsonian patients. Stronger T-type current enhanced post-inhibitory rebound bursting and expanded synchronized rhythmic activity, reducing the range of intermittent synchrony and increasing resistance to external entrainment. Stronger L-type current prolonged STN bursts, promoted intermittent synchrony over a wide range of input amplitudes, and sustained beta oscillations, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of PD. These results highlight the interplay between intrinsic cellular properties, synaptic parameters, and external inputs in shaping pathological synchronized rhythms in BG networks. Understanding these network mechanisms may advance the understanding of Parkinsonian rhythmogenesis and further assist in finding ways to modulate and suppress pathological rhythms.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing Shapes Real-World Decision-Making through Dynamic Evidence Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.</description>

      <title>Systems Explaining Systems: A Framework for Intelligence and Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a conceptual framework in which intelligence and consciousness emerge from relational structure rather than from prediction or domain-specific mechanisms. Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.
  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.
  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Phasor Agents: Oscillatory Graphs with Three-Factor Plasticity and Sleep-Staged Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phasor Agents are dynamical systems whose internal state is a Phasor Graph: a weighted graph of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. A Stuart-Landau oscillator is a minimal stable "rhythm generator" (the normal form near a Hopf bifurcation); each oscillator is treated as an abstract computational unit (inspired by, but not claiming to model, biological oscillatory populations). In this interpretation, oscillator phase tracks relative timing (coherence), while amplitude tracks local gain or activity. Relative phase structure serves as a representational medium; coupling weights are learned via three-factor local plasticity - eligibility traces gated by sparse global modulators and oscillation-timed write windows - without backpropagation.
  A central challenge in oscillatory substrates is stability: online weight updates can drive the network into unwanted regimes (e.g., global synchrony), collapsing representational diversity. We therefore separate wake tagging from offline consolidation, inspired by synaptic tagging-and-capture and sleep-stage dynamics: deep-sleep-like gated capture commits tagged changes safely, while REM-like replay reconstructs and perturbs experience for planning.
  A staged experiment suite validates each mechanism with ablations and falsifiers: eligibility traces preserve credit under delayed modulation; compression-progress signals pass timestamp-shuffle controls; phase-coherent retrieval reaches 4x diffusive baselines under noise; wake/sleep separation expands stable learning by 67 percent under matched weight-norm budgets; REM replay improves maze success rate by +45.5 percentage points; and a Tolman-style latent-learning signature - immediate competence and detour advantage after unrewarded exploration, consistent with an internal model - emerges from replay (Tolman, 1948).
  The codebase and all artifacts are open-source.</description>

      <title>H\'an D\=an Xu\'e B\`u (Mimicry) or Q\=ing Ch\=u Y\'u L\'an (Mastery)? A Cognitive Perspective on Reasoning Distillation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a "natural" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the "H\'an D\=an Xu\'e B\`u" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a "Functional Alignment Collapse": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines ("Negative Transfer"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a "Cargo Cult" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation.</description>

      <title>Geometric developmental principles for the emergence of brain-like weighted and directed neuronal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.</description>

      <title>Modeling flexible behavior with remapping-based hippocampal sequence learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals flexibly change their behavior depending on context. It is reported that the hippocampus is one of the most prominent regions for contextual behaviors, and its sequential activity shows context dependency. However, how such context-dependent sequential activity is established through reorganization of neuronal activity (remapping) is unclear. To better understand the formation of hippocampal activity and its contribution to context-dependent flexible behavior, we present a novel biologically plausible reinforcement learning model. In this model, Context selector promotes the formation of context-dependent sequential activity and allows for flexible switching of behavior in multiple contexts. This model reproduces a variety of findings from neural activity, optogenetic inactivation, human fMRI, and clinical research. Furthermore, our model predicts that imbalances in the ratio between sensory and contextual representations in Context selector account for schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors.</description>
