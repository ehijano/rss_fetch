      <title>Doppler effect in vacuum and medium in X-ray range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the Doppler effect for radiation emitted by a relativistic oscillator in vacuum described geometrically as an ellipsoid in momentum space. Spectral and angular properties of the Doppler X-ray radiation emitted by a relativistic oscillator moving through a homogeneous medium are considered. Additionally, we show that radiation from an elementary relativistic charged particle interacting with periodic medium can be interpreted as a manifestation of the Doppler effect. Examples include parametric X-ray radiation, coherent bremsstrahlung, undulator radiation in crystalline or vacuum undulators, transition radiation from stacked foils, and Smith-Purcell radiation.</description>

      <title>Polarized electron bunch refresh rates in an electron storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When polarized electron bunches are injected and circulated in a high-energy storage ring, the polarization of the bunches relaxes to the asymptotic value of the radiative polarization, caused by the synchrotron radiation. Hence the bunches must be refreshed periodically, to maintain a predetermined time-averaged value of the bunch polarization. In general, the refresh rates of the "up" and "down" polarization bunches are different. We suggest an alternative policy. We point out that the total bunch refresh rate is almost independent of the asymptotic level of the radiative polarization. We also note that the true goal of so-called "spin matching" is to maximize the buildup time constant (not the asymptotic level) of the radiative polarization. We suggest a scheme to equalize the refresh rates of the "up" and "down" polarization bunches, which may be (i) helpful for accelerator operations, and also (ii) reduce systematic errors in HEP experiments.</description>

      <title>Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 {\deg}C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 $\mu$A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>
