      <title>Robust ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of E2 and radius observables. I. Electric quadrupole moments and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converged results for E2 observables are notoriously challenging to obtain in ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) approaches. Matrix elements of the E2 operator are sensitive to the large-distance tails of the nuclear wave function, which converge slowly in an oscillator basis expansion. Similar convergence challenges beset ab initio prediction of the nuclear charge radius. However, we exploit systematic correlations between the calculated E2 and radius observables to yield meaningful predictions for relations among these observables. In particular, we examine ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of the form Q/r^2, for nuclei throughout the $p$ shell. Meaningful predictions for electric quadrupole moments may then be made by calibrating to the ground-state charge radius, if experimentally known, or vice versa. Moreover, these dimensionless ratios provide ab initio insight into the nuclear quadrupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Deuteron, triton, helium-3 and hypertriton production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions via stochastic multi-particle reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of light nuclei in heavy -ion collisions is an excellent probe for studying the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics and for the search of a critical end point. In this work we apply a hybrid approach in which we study the light nuclei production in the afterburner stage of central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=7.7$, 14.5 and 19.6 GeV. In this stage, light nuclei are produced dynamically in $4\leftrightarrow 2$ catalysis reactions. A comparison of the dynamic production and a coalescence approach is presented for transverse momentum spectra of deuterons, tritons, $^3\rm He$ nuclei and hypertritons and ratios of light nuclei yields. A good agreement with the experimentally measured yield of nuclei is found and we proceed to further investigate the production mechanisms of light nuclei by calculating the rates of the important channels for the formation and disintegration. We find that the afterburner stage is essential for the description of light nuclei formation in heavy-ion collisions, as light nuclei undergo a large number of interactions.</description>

      <title>Seven years of the proxy-SU(3) shell model symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proxy-SU(3) symmetry was first presented in HINPw4 in Ioannina in May2017, justified within the Nilsson model and applied to parameter-free predictions of the collective variables beta and gamma in medium-mass and heavy nuclei. Major steps forward, including the connection of the proxy-SU(3) symmetry to the shell model, the justification of the dominance of highest weight states in terms of the short range nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, as well as the first proposal of appearance of islands of shape coexistence on the nuclear chart, have been presented in HINPw6 in Athens in May 2021. The recently hot topic of the prevalence of triaxial shapes in heavy nuclei will also be briefly outlined in the proxy-SU(3) framework.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times for disoriented isospin condensates in high energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC exceed conventional explanations. Previously it was shown that if the scalar condensate is accompanied by an electrically neutral isospin--1 field then the combination can produce large equilibrium fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons. Here we estimate the times for the condensates to achieve their equilibrium probability distributions within causal volumes in high energy heavy ion collisions. This is achieved by modeling the temperature dependence of the condensates, mesonic collective excitations, decay rates of the associated fields, and employing the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. We find that the equilibration times are short compared with the expansion time, and therefore disoriented isospin condensates are a viable explanation for the anomalous fluctuations observed at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Direct quarkonium production in DIS from a joint CGC and NRQCD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the differential cross section for direct quarkonium production in high-energy electron-nucleus collisions at small $x$. Our computation is performed within the nonrelativistic QCD factorization formalism that separates the calculation into short distance coefficients and long distance matrix elements that depend on the color and spin of the state. We obtain the short distance coefficients of the production of the heavy quark pair within the framework of the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, which resums coherent multiple interactions of the heavy quark pair with the nucleus to all orders. Our results are expressed as the convolution of perturbatively calculable perturbative functions with multi-point light-like Wilson line correlators. In the correlation limit, we establish the correspondence between our CGC formulation with calculations employing the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) framework. We extend this correspondence by resumming kinematic power corrections within the improved TMD framework, which interpolates between the TMD formalism and $k_\perp$ factorization formalism. We present a detailed numerical analysis, focusing on $J/\psi$ production in the kinematics accessible at the future Electron-Ion Collider, highlighting the importance of genuine higher-order saturation contributions when the electron collides with a large nucleus.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of jet quenching to the initial state in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions, nuclear matter is subjected to extreme conditions in a highly dynamical, rapidly evolving environment. This poses a tremendous challenge for calculating jet quenching observables. Current approaches rely on analytical results for static cases, introducing theoretical uncertainties and biases in our understanding of the pre-equilibrated medium. To address this issue, we employ resummation schemes to derive analytical rates for radiative energy loss in generic, evolving backgrounds. We investigate regimes where rare scattering and multiple scattering with the dynamical medium occurs, and extract relevant scales governing the in-medium emission rate of soft gluons. Our analysis indicates that strong jet quenching is only possible when the equilibration time of the medium is longer than its mean free path, highlighting the importance of medium modifications of jets in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions. We also demonstrate analytically that a medium evolution, which initially has a small coupling to jets, typically leads to a stronger jet azimuthal asymmetry at the same jet suppression factor.</description>

      <title>Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work, that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor. Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.</description>

      <title>Removal of $K$-mixing in angular momentum projected nuclear wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angular momentum projection plays a key role in studying quantum many-body systems with rotational invariance such as atomic nuclei. At a given spin $J$, one can generate $2J+1$ angular momentum projected states labeled with $-J\leq K \leq J$ from a deformed Slater determinant. Usually, a nuclear wave function with $K$-mixing can be expressed as a superposition of all these $2J+1$ projected states, where the coefficients can be obtained by solving the generalized eigenvalue equation. In this Letter, we report a new fundamental feature that the frequently discussed $K$-mixing in the angular momentum projected nuclear wave function can be safely removed. Strikingly, we found that such nuclear wave function with $K$-mixing can always be equivalently replaced by a single projected state with any given $K$. Consequently, such nuclear wave function can be significantly simplified, especially for high-spin states. This also indicates that the $K$-mixing in the angular momentum projected nuclear wave functions, adopted by many present-day nuclear models, does not carry any physical meaning, and is essentially different from that $K$-mixing caused by the Coriolis force in the cranked shell model.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of transient hydrodynamics for the hadron-resonance gas and thermal-mass quasiparticle models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate all transport coefficients of second order transient hydrodynamics in two effective kinetic theory models: a hadron-resonance gas and a quasiparticle model with thermal masses tuned to reproduce QCD thermodynamics. We compare the corresponding results with calculations for an ultrarelativistic single-component gas, that are widely employed in hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions. We find that both of these effective models display a qualitatively different normalized bulk viscosity, when compared to the calculation for the single-component gas. Indeed, $\zeta/[\tau_{\Pi}(\varepsilon_{0} + P_{0})] \simeq 16.91(1/3-c_{s}^{2})^{2}$, for the hadron-resonance gas model, and $\zeta/[\tau_{\Pi}(\varepsilon_{0} + P_{0})] \simeq 5 (1/3-c_{s}^{2})$ for the quasiparticle model. Differences are also observed for many second-order transport coefficients, specially those related to the bulk viscous pressure. The transport coefficients derived are shown to be consistent with fundamental linear stability and causality conditions.</description>

      <title>Static force from generalized Wilson loops on the lattice using the gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The static QCD force from the lattice can be used to extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$, which determines the running of the strong coupling. Usually, this is done with a numerical derivative of the static potential. However, this introduces additional systematic uncertainties; thus, we use another observable to measure the static force directly. This observable consists of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field insertion. We work in the pure SU(3) gauge theory. We use gradient flow to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to address the field insertion. We extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0}$ from the data by exploring different methods to perform the zero-flow-time limit. We obtain the value $\sqrt{8t_0} \Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0} =0.629^{+22}_{-26}$, where $t_0$ is a flow-time reference scale. We also obtain precise determinations of several scales: $r_0/r_1$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_0$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_1$ and we compare these to the literature. The gradient flow appears to be a promising method for calculations of Wilson loops with chromoelectric and chromomagnetic insertions in quenched and unquenched configurations</description>

      <title>Interplay between the weak-coupling results and the lattice data in dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between two first-principles calculations of QCD at high density: perturbative results in the weak-coupling regime and the recent lattice-QCD result at finite isospin density. By comparing these two results, we verify empirically that the weak-coupling calculations of the bulk thermodynamics and the gap parameter for Cooper pairing between quarks can be applicable down to the quark chemical potential $\mu \sim 1$ GeV. Having verified the validity of the weak-coupling results in QCD at finite isospin density, we discuss possible effects on QCD at finite baryon density, which is relevant for the application to realistic environments such as neutron stars, by using the fact that QCD at finite baryon and isospin density have the common weak-coupling expansions. First, we show the size of the color-superconducting gap at finite baryon density is as small as a few MeV at $\mu = 1$ GeV, which implies that the color-flavor locked phase may be unstable against unpairing up to $\mu \sim 1.4$ GeV even in the weak-coupling regime. We also introduce a prescription to reduce the ambiguity arising from the undetermined renormalization scale in the weak-coupling calculation by matching with the lattice-QCD data. We demonstrate the effect of such reduction on neutron-star phenomenology by performing the Bayesian analysis.</description>
