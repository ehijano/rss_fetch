      <title>Multi-photon stimulated grasers assisted by laser-plasma interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the possibility of achieving the stimulated amplification of $\gamma$-rays. Herein, our approach circumvents the so-called ``graser dilemma" through a non-linear, multi-photon mechanism. Our work foresees the combination of a high-intensity $\gamma-$flash generated by the interaction of a high-intensity laser pulse with plasma and intensive photons supplied by an additional laser. We show that multi-photon stimulated emission processes can have a larger effective cross-section compared to a one-photon process. The bandwidth of the supplied photons can also be tuned to curtail linewidth broadening. Naturally, Mossbauer transitions can be chosen to apply the scheme in the first instance. Furthermore, we derive that even multi-photon stimulated emission in the form of an anti-Stokes type could allow our scheme to be applied to non-Mossbauer nuclei, provided that the supplied photon energy can be tuned to compensate for the recoil and other broadening induced losses. The graser development can be spearheaded using multi-PW class high-power laser systems such as the 10 PW installation at Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP) in Romania.</description>

      <title>Coherent radiation of an electron bunch colliding with an intense laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conditions for coherent radiation of an electron bunch driven by a counterpropagating strong pulsed electromagnetic plane wave. We derive the spectrum of the coherent radiation and show that it is emitted backwards with respect to the laser propagation direction and has a very narrow angular spread. We demonstrate that for a solid density plasma coherent radiation extends to frequencies up to hundreds of keV thereby enhancing the low-frequency part of the spectrum by many orders of magnitude. Our analytical findings are tested with 3D particle-in-cell simulations of an electron bunch passing through a laser pulse, clearly demonstrating how the coherence can essentially modify the observed radiation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Lessons Learned from Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers in the field of ultra-intense laser science are beginning to embrace machine learning methods. In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced heating in molecular atmospheric pressure plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that ions are strongly coupled in atmospheric pressure plasmas when the ionization fraction is sufficiently large, leading to a temperature increase from disorder-induced heating that is not accounted for in standard modelling techniques. Here, we extend this study to molecular plasmas. A main finding is that the energy gained by ions in disorder-induced heating gets spread over both translational and rotational degrees of freedom on a nanosecond timescale, causing the final ion and neutral gas temperatures to be lower in the molecular case than in the atomic case. A model is developed for the equilibrium temperature that agrees well with molecular dynamics simulations. The model and simulations are also applied to pressures up to ten atmospheres. We conclude that disorder-induced heating is a significant and predictable phenomenon in molecular atmospheric pressure plasmas.</description>

      <title>Self-pulsing of Dielectric Barrier Discharges at Low Driving Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the self-pulsing of Dielectric Barrier Discharges (DBDs) at low driving frequencies. In particular, (a) the dependence of current on the product pd of gas pressure p and the gas gap length d, (b) the effects of lossy dielectrics (in resistive discharges) and large dielectric permittivity (in ferroelectrics) on current dynamics, (c) the transition from Townsend to a dynamic Capacitively Coupled Plasma (CCP) discharge with changing pd values, and (d) the transition from Townsend to a high-frequency CCP regime with increasing the driving frequency. A one-dimensional fluid model of Argon plasma is coupled to an equivalent RC circuit for lossy dielectrics. Our results show multiple current pulses per AC period in Townsend and CCP discharge modes which are explained by uncoupled electron-ion transport in the absence of quasineutrality and surface charge deposition at dielectric interfaces. The number of current pulses decreases with an increasing applied frequency when the Townsend discharge transforms into the CCP discharge. The resistive barrier discharge with lossy dielectrics exhibits Townsend and glow modes for the same pd value (7.6 Torr cm) for higher and lower resistances, respectively. Finally,we show that ferroelectric materials can amplify discharge current in DBDs. Similarities between current pulsing in DBD, Trichel pulses in corona discharges, and subnormal oscillations in DC discharges are discussed. 1</description>

      <title>Calculating radio emissions of positive streamer phenomena using 3D simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study radio emissions from positive streamers in air using 3D simulations, from which the radiated electric field is computed by solving Jefimenko's equations. The simulations are performed at 0.5 bar using two photoionization methods: the Helmholtz approximation for a photon density and a Monte Carlo method using discrete photons, with the latter being the most realistic. We consider cases with single streamers, streamer branching, streamers interacting with preionization and streamer-streamer encounters. We do not observe a strong VHF radio signal during or after branching, which is confirmed by lab experiments. This indicates that the current inside a streamer discharges evolves approximately continuously during branching. On the other hand, stochastic fluctuations in streamer propagation due to Monte Carlo photoionization lead to more radio emission being emitted at frequencies of 100 MHz and above. Another process that leads to such high-frequency emission is the interaction of a streamer with a weakly preionized region, for example present due to a previous discharge. In agreement with previous work, we observe the strongest and highest-frequency emission from streamer encounters. The amount of total energy that is radiated seems to depend primarily on the background electric field, and less on the particular streamer evolution. Finally, we present approximations for the maximal current along a streamer channel and a fit formula for a streamer's current moment.</description>
