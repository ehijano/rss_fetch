      <title>Nesting of double-dimer loops: local fluctuations and convergence to the nesting field of CLE(4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the double-dimer model in the upper-half plane discretized by the square lattice with mesh size $\delta$. For each point $x$ in the upper half-plane, we consider the random variable $N_\delta(x)$ given by the number of the double-dimer loops surrounding this point. We prove that the normalized fluctuations of $N_\delta(x)$ for a fixed $x$ are asymptotically Gaussian as $\delta\to 0+$. Further, we prove that the double-dimer nesting field $N_\delta(\cdot) - \mathbb{E}\, N_\delta(\cdot)$, viewed as a random distribution in the upper half-plane, converges as $\delta\to 0+$ to the nesting field of CLE(4) constructed by Miller, Watson and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions of pseudospherical surfaces described by a class of third order differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a specific type of pseudospherical surfaces defined by a class of third order differential equations, of the form $u_t - u_{xxt} = \lambda u^2 u_{xxx} + G(u, u_x, u_{xx})$, and poses a question about the dependence of the triples $\{a,b,c\}$ of the second fundamental form in the context of local isometric immersion in $\mathbb{E}^3$. It is demonstrated that the triples $\{a,b,c\}$ of the second fundamental form are not influenced by a jet of finite order of $u$. Instead, they are shown to rely on a jet of order zero, making them universal and not reliant on the specific solution chosen for $u$.</description>

      <title>A microscopic realization of dS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise duality between pure de Sitter quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions and a double-scaled matrix integral. This duality unfolds in two distinct aspects. First, by carefully quantizing the gravitational phase space, we arrive at a novel proposal for the quantum state of the universe at future infinity. We compute cosmological correlators of massive particles in the universe specified by this wavefunction. Integrating these correlators over the metric at future infinity yields gauge-invariant observables, which are identified with the string amplitudes of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. This establishes a direct connection between integrated cosmological correlators and the resolvents of the matrix integral dual to the complex Liouville string, thereby demonstrating one aspect of the dS$_3$/matrix integral duality. The second aspect concerns the cosmological horizon of the dS static patch and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy it is conjectured to encode. We show that this entropy can be reproduced exactly by counting the entries of the matrix.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic approximations for convection onset with Ekman pumping at low wavenumbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ekman pumping is a phenomenon induced by no-slip boundary conditions in rotating fluids. In the context of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, Ekman pumping causes a significant change in the linear stability of the system compared to when it is not present (that is, stress-free). Motivated by numerical solutions to the marginal stability problem of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (iNSE) system, we seek analytical asymptotic solutions which describe the departure of the no-slip solution from the stress-free. The substitution of normal modes into a reduced asymptotic model yields a linear system for which we explore analytical solutions for various scalings of wavenumber. We find very good agreement between the analytical asymptotic solutions and the numerical solutions to the iNSE linear stability problem with no-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>pyBoLaNO: A Python symbolic package for normal ordering involving bosonic ladder operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pyBoLaNO, a Python symbolic package based on SymPy to quickly normal-order (Wick-order) any polynomial in bosonic ladder operators. By extension, this package offers the normal ordering of commutators of any two polynomials in bosonic ladder operators and the evaluation of the normal-ordered expectation value evolution in the Lindblad master equation framework for open quantum systems. The package also supports multipartite descriptions and multiprocessing. We describe the package's workflow, show examples of use, and discuss its computational performance. All codes and examples are available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model of the Emergence of Autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formal model of the emergence of self-constructing objects (e.g. heteropolymers with autocatalytic capability) in an open system, which don't contain such objects initially. The objects are constructed from subunits (e.g. monomers). Each object is characterized by the difference of self-instructed reproduction and decomposition rate only. This difference, divided by a common dimensional constant, is called ``productivity''. Due to external influence the productivity of each object can randomly change. The system as a whole is subjected to external limitation: the total number of the objects is conserved (e.g., by the controlled influx of monomers). We consider such process as possibly simplest example of self-organization. We obtained exact solutions of our model for several presumed mechanisms of random change of the productivity. We have shown that the probability to find self-constructing objects in the system necessarily increases, even if initially it was equal to zero.</description>

      <title>A Modified Davey-Stewartson System of Nonlinear Dust Acoustic Waves in (3+1)-Dimensions: Lie Symmetries and Exact Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the analysis of a modified Davey-Stewartson system in three space dimensions, which was obtained in plasma physics for propagation of nonlinear dust acoustic waves. The system differs from the Davey-Stewartson systems available in the literature by an additional term which can be viewed as a constant complex potential. We show that, under a certain condition on the parameters of the system, this term can be removed by a transformation. This restriction also separates the different realizations of Lie symmetry algebra of the modified Davey-Stewartson system, which is identified as semi-direct sum of a finite-dimensional algebra with a Kac-Moody algebra. Having shed light on the group-theoretical properties of the system, we present several results on the exact solutions of generalized traveling wave type, some of which are line solitons and kink solitons on planes in space. We finalize by analysing the stability of traveling wave solutions.</description>

Abstract: We consider N bosons on the unit torus $\Lambda = [0,1]^3$ in the Gross-Pitaevski regime where the interaction potential scales as $N^2 V (N(x -y))$. We prove that the thermal equilibrium at low temperatures exhibits the Bose-Einstein condensation in a strong sense, namely the probability of having $n$ particles outside of the condensation decays exponentially in $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the number of quasinormal modes (QNM) for Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in a disc of radius $ r $ is bounded from below by $ c r^3 $. This shows that the recent upper bound by J\'ez\'equel is sharp. The argument is an application of a spectral asymptotics result for non-self-adjoint operators which provides a finer description of QNM and explains the emergence of a distorted lattice on which they lie. Our presentation gives a general result about exponentially accurate Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules for one dimensional problems. The description of QNM allows their accurate evaluation ``deep in the complex" where numerical methods break down due to pseudospectral effects.</description>

Abstract: We study the infinite-dimensional log-Sobolev inequality for spin systems on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with interactions of power higher than quadratic. We assume that the one site measure without a boundary $e^{-\phi(x)}dx/Z$ satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality and we determine conditions so that the infinite-dimensional Gibbs measure also satisfies the inequality. As a concrete application, we prove that a certain class of nontrivial Gibbs measures with non-quadratic interaction potentials on an infinite product of Heisenberg groups satisfy the log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Parallel surface defects, Hecke operators, and quantum Hitchin system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine two types of half-BPS surface defects $-$ regular monodromy surface defect and canonical surface defect $-$ in four-dimensional gauge theory with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and $\Omega_{\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2}$-background. Mathematically, we investigate integrals over the moduli spaces of parabolic framed sheaves over $\mathbb{P}^2$. Using analytic methods of $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories, we demonstrate that the former gives a twisted $\mathcal{D}$-module on $\text{Bun}_{G_{\mathbb{C}}}$ while the latter acts as a Hecke operator. In the limit $\varepsilon_2 \to 0$, the cluster decomposition implies the Hecke eigensheaf property for the regular monodromy surface defect. The eigenvalues are given by the opers associated to the canonical surface defect. We derive, in our $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theoretical framework, that the twisted $\mathcal{D}$-modules assigned to the opers in the geometric Langlands correspondence represent the spectral equations for quantum Hitchin integrable system. A duality to topologically twisted four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory is discussed, in which the two surface defects are mapped to Dirichlet boundary and 't Hooft line defect. This is consistent with earlier works on the $\mathcal{N}=4$ theory approach to the geometric Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>On the return probability of the simple random walk on Galton-Watson trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on Galton-Watson trees with supercritical offspring distribution, conditioned on non-extinction. In case the offspring distribution has finite support, we prove an upper bound for the annealed return probability to the root which decays subexponentially in time with exponent 1/3. This exponent is optimal. Our result improves the previously known subexponential upper bound with exponent 1/5 by Piau [Ann. Probab. 26, 1016-1040 (1998)]. For offspring distributions with unbounded support but sufficiently fast decay, our method also yields improved subexponential upper bounds.</description>

Abstract: We explore the $\textit{difference Langlands correspondence}$ using the four dimensional ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ super-QCD. Surface defects and surface observables play the crucial role. As an application, we give the first construction of the full set of quantum integrals, i.e. commuting differential operators, such that the partition function of the so-called regular monodromy surface defect is their joint eigenvectors in an evaluation module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$, making it the wavefunction of a $N$-site $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ spin chain with bi-infinite spin modules. We construct the $\mathbf{Q}$- and $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}$-surface observables which are believed to be the $Q$-operators on the bi-infinite module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$, and compute their eigenvalues, the $Q$-functions, as vevs of the surface observables.</description>

      <title>Bispectral duality and separation of variables from surface defect transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two types of surface observables $-$ the $\mathbf{Q}$-observables and the $\mathbf{H}$-observables $-$ of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $A_1$-quiver $U(N)$ gauge theory obtained by coupling a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma model. We demonstrate that the transition between the two surface defects manifests as a Fourier transformation between the surface observables. Utilizing the results from our previous works, which establish that the $\mathbf{Q}$-observables and the $\mathbf{H}$-observables give rise, respectively, to the $Q$-operators on the evaluation module over the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}(2))$ and the Hecke operators on the twisted $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(N)$-coinvariants, we derive an exact duality between the spectral problems of the $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ XXX spin chain with $N$ sites and the $\mathfrak{sl}(N)$ Gaudin model with 4 sites, both of which are defined on bi-infinite modules. Moreover, we present a dual description of the monodromy surface defect as coupling a 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauged linear sigma model. Employing this dual perspective, we demonstrate how the monodromy surface defect undergoes a transition to multiple $\mathbf{Q}$-observables or $\mathbf{H}$-observables, implemented through integral transformations between their surface observables. These transformations provide, respectively, $\hbar$-deformation and a higher-rank generalization of the KZ/BPZ correspondence. In the limit $\varepsilon_2\to 0$, they give rise to the quantum separation of variables for the $\mathfrak{gl}(2)$ XXX spin chain and the $\mathfrak{sl}(N)$ Gaudin model, respectively.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of homogeneous rotational Brownian motion</title>

Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterised by an orientation-dependent ("multiplicative") noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether Ito's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalisation constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favourable prefactor of the discretisation error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used, ad hoc algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations. The discussion is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>

      <title>Effective short distance interaction in Calogero-Sutherland quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effective conformal field theory with symmetry W-infinity x W-infinity that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model. In the repulsive regime of the free fermion formulation, we identify an attractive interaction between opposite moving particle-hole pairs that dominates the short distance behavior and that is proposed as responsible for the destabilization of the ground state, leading to a new one of bosonic nature. The process is described by a Bogoliubov transformation of the free fermion bilinear operators into bosonic ones, preserving the form of the W-infinity algebra but decoupling the opposite chirality terms in the hamiltonian, as expected in the low energy limit. In coordinate space this interaction has a short range component that arises due to the quantum regularization of the theory. The described dynamical process may be considered as a mechanism of the emergence of the known charge and quantum statistics fractionalization of the low lying excitations of the theory, as predicted in both first and second quantization studies.</description>
