      <title>Impacts of Backside Insulation on the Dynamic On-Resistance of Lateral p-GaN HEMTs-on-Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the effect of backside insulation on the dynamic on-resistance of lateral p-GaN HEMTs. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic onresistance difference between substrate grounded and substrate floating p-GaN HEMTs, we conducted in-circuit double pulse testing and long-term direct current (DC) bias stress. We have realized that while backside insulation can enhance the breakdown voltage of lateral p-GaN HEMTs, it also comes with a tradeoff in device reliability. Results through Sentaurus TCAD simulation suggest that the use of backside insulation in devices gradually disperses potential to the buffer barrier. As a result, the potential barrier at the buffer edge of the 2DEG channel decreases significantly, leading to considerable electron trappings at buffer traps. This breakdown voltage and reliability tradeoff also applies to HEMT technologies using insulating substrates.</description>

      <title>Cavitated Ag Paste for Cost-Effective Solar Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the investigation of cavitated silver paste produced by cavitation technology as a cost-effective alternative to traditional three-roll milling (TRM). Cavitation, utilizing high-frequency sound waves, enhances metal paste dispersion, reduces oxidation, extends shelf life, and minimizes waste. Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar cells made with cavitated silver paste achieved a 21% energy conversion efficiency, slightly lower than the 22% efficiency of conventional paste. Cavitated paste produced finer gridlines, reducing silver usage and costs but increasing contact resistance, leading to a lower fill factor. Despite this, cavitation technology shows promise for more efficient and cost-effective solar cell production. Further research is needed to optimize efficiency and resistance, highlighting the potential for cavitation technology in commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Selecting Alternative Metals for Advanced Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, interconnect resistance and reliability are key limiters for the performance of advanced CMOS circuits. As transistor scaling is slowing, interconnect scaling has become the main driver for circuit miniaturization, and interconnect limitations are expected to become even more stringent in future CMOS technology nodes. Current Cu dual-damascene metallization is also becoming increasingly challenging as critical interconnect dimensions approach 10 nm, alternative metallization schemes are researched with increasing intensity for about a decade. The selection of alternative metals is a highly multifaceted task and includes many criteria, covering the resistivity at reduced dimension, reliability and thermal aspects, as well as a sustainability perspective. In this tutorial, we introduce the basic criteria for alternative metal benchmarking and selection, and discuss the current state of the art of the field. The tutorial covers materials close to manufacturing introduction, materials under actual research, as well as future directions for fundamental research. While first alternatives to Cu metallization in commercial CMOS devices have become a reality recently, research for the ultimate interconnect metal is ongoing.</description>

      <title>Self-reconfigurable Multifunctional Memristive Nociceptor for Intelligent Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial nociceptors, mimicking human-like stimuli perception, are of significance for intelligent robotics to work in hazardous and dynamic scenarios. One of the most essential characteristics of the human nociceptor is its self-adjustable attribute, which indicates that the threshold of determination of a potentially hazardous stimulus relies on environmental knowledge. This critical attribute has been currently omitted, but it is highly desired for artificial nociceptors. Inspired by these shortcomings, this article presents, for the first time, a Self-Directed Channel (SDC) memristor-based self-reconfigurable nociceptor, capable of perceiving hazardous pressure stimuli under different temperatures and demonstrates key features of tactile nociceptors, including 'threshold,' 'no-adaptation,' and 'sensitization.' The maximum amplification of hazardous external stimuli is 1000%, and its response characteristics dynamically adapt to current temperature conditions by automatically altering the generated modulation schemes for the memristor. The maximum difference ratio of the response of memristors at different temperatures is 500%, and this adaptability closely mimics the functions of biological tactile nociceptors, resulting in accurate danger perception in various conditions. Beyond temperature adaptation, this memristor-based nociceptor has the potential to integrate different sensory modalities by applying various sensors, thereby achieving human-like perception capabilities in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Canard explosions in turbulent thermo-fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sudden transition to a state of high amplitude limit cycle oscillations is catastrophic in a thermo-fluid system. Conventionally, upon varying the control parameter, a sudden transition is observed as an abrupt jump in the amplitude of the fluctuations in these systems. In contrast, we present an experimental discovery of a canard explosion in a turbulent reactive flow system where we observe a continuous bifurcation with a rapid rise in the amplitude of the fluctuations within a narrow range of control parameters. The observed transition is facilitated via a state of bursting, consisting of the epochs of large amplitude periodic oscillations amidst the epochs of low amplitude periodic oscillations. The amplitude of the bursts is higher than the amplitude of the bursts of intermittency state in a conventional gradual transition, as reported in turbulent reactive flow systems. During the bursting state, we observe that temperature fluctuations of exhaust gas vary at a slower time scale in correlation with the amplitude envelope of the bursts. We also present a phenomenological model for thermoacoustic systems to describe the observed canard explosion. Using the model, we explain that the large amplitude bursts occur due to the slow-fast dynamics at the bifurcation regime of the canard explosion.</description>

      <title>Compact low-half-wave-voltage thin film lithium niobate electro-optic phase modulator fabricated by photolithography assisted chemo-mechanical etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a compact dual-arm thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) electro-optic phase modulator fabricated using the photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technique. The design of the device allows for complete utilization of the microwave electric field, doubling the modulation efficiency compared to single-arm modulators in theory. With a half-wave voltage of approximately 3 V and a modulation length of 1 cm, the device outperforms conventional phase modulators. Furthermore, the phase modulator exhibits low sensitivity to optical wavelengths in the range of 1510-1600 nm and offers a low insertion loss of 2.8 dB. The capability to generate multiple sideband signals for optical frequency comb applications is also demonstrated, producing 29 sideband signals at an input microwave power of 2 W.</description>

      <title>Wavelength tuning of VCSELs via controlled strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Besides major advantages for telecommunication applications, VCSELs have attracted interest for their potential for neuro-inspired computing, frequency comb generation or high-frequency spin oscillations. In the meantime, strain applied to the laser structure has been shown to have a significant impact on the laser emission properties such as the polarization dynamics or birefringence. In this work, we further explore the influence of strain on VCSELs and how this effect could be used to fine tune the laser wavelength. Through a comprehensive investigation, we demonstrate consistent wavelength shift up to 1 nm and report a sensitivity between 0.12 to 0.18 nm / millistrain. We also record birefringence values up to 292 GHz. Our results show that controlled strain level could be considered for fine wavelength tuning and possibly alleviate the selection of VCSEL for precise wavelength requirements.</description>

      <title>Si1-x-yGeySnx alloy formation by Sn ion implantation and flash lamp annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many years, Si1-yGey alloys have been applied in the semiconductor industry due to the ability to adjust the performance of Si-based nanoelectronic devices. Following this alloying approach of group-IV semiconductors, adding tin (Sn) into the alloy appears as the obvious next step, which leads to additional possibilities for tailoring the material properties. Adding Sn enables effective band gap and strain engineering and can improve the carrier mobilities, which makes Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys promising candidates for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. The bottom-up approach for epitaxial growth of Si1-x-yGeySnx, e.g., by chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, allows tuning the material properties in the growth direction only; the realization of local material modifications to generate lateral heterostructures with such a bottom-up approach is extremely elaborate, since it would require the use of lithography, etching, and either selective epitaxy or epitaxy and chemical-mechanical polishing giving rise to interface issues, non-planar substrates, etc. This article shows the possibility of fabricating Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys by Sn ion beam implantation into Si1-yGey layers followed by millisecond-range flash lamp annealing (FLA). The materials are investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, micro Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The fabrication approach was adapted to ultra-thin Si1-yGey layers on silicon-on-insulator substrates. The results show the fabrication of single-crystalline Si1-x-yGeySnx with up to 2.3 at.% incorporated Sn without any indication of Sn segregation after recrystallization via FLA. Finally, we exhibit the possibility of implanting Sn locally in ultra-thin Si1-yGey films by masking unstructured regions on the chip.</description>

      <title>Structural changes in Ge1-xSnx and Si1-x-yGeySnx thin films on SOI substrates treated by pulse laser annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ge1-xSnx and Si1-x-yGeySnx alloys are promising materials for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. These alloys enable effective band-gap engineering, broad adjustability of their lattice parameter, exhibit much higher carrier mobility than pure Si, and are compatible with the CMOS technology. Unfortunately, the equilibrium solid solubility of Sn in Si1-xGex is less than 1% and the pseudomorphic growth of Si1-x-yGeySnx on Ge or Si can cause in-plane compressive strain in the grown layer, degrading the superior properties of these alloys. Therefore, post-growth strain engineering by ultrafast non-equilibrium thermal treatments like pulse laser annealing (PLA) is needed to improve the layer quality. In this article, Ge0.94Sn0.06 and Si0.14Ge0.8Sn0.06 thin films grown on silicon-on-insulator substrates by molecular beam epitaxy were post growth thermally treated by PLA. The material is analyzed before and after the thermal treatments by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Hall effect measurements. It is shown that after annealing, the material is single-crystalline with improved crystallinity than the as-grown layer. This is reflected in a significantly increased XRD reflection intensity, well-ordered atomic pillars, and increased active carrier concentrations up to 4x1019 cm-3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging technologies that employ quantum physics offer fundamental enhancements in information processing tasks, including sensing, communications, and computing. Here, we introduce the quantum phased array, which generalizes the operating principles of phased arrays and wavefront engineering to quantum fields, and report the first quantum phased array technology demonstration. An integrated photonic-electronic system is used to manipulate free-space quantum information to establish reconfigurable wireless quantum links in a standalone, compact form factor. Such a robust, scalable, and integrated quantum platform can enable broad deployment of quantum technologies with high connectivity, potentially expanding their use cases to real-world applications. We report the first, to our knowledge, free-space-to-chip interface for quantum links, enabled by 32 metamaterial antennas with more than 500,000 sub-wavelength engineered nanophotonic elements over a 550 x 550 $\mathrm{\mu m}^2$ physical aperture. We implement a 32-channel array of quantum coherent receivers with 30.3 dB shot noise clearance and 90.2 dB common-mode rejection ratio that downconverts the quantum optical information via homodyne detection and processes it coherently in the radio-frequency domain. With our platform, we demonstrate 32-pixel imaging of squeezed light for quantum sensing, reconfigurable free-space links for quantum communications, and proof-of-concept entanglement generation for measurement-based quantum computing. This approach offers targeted, real-time, dynamically-adjustable free-space capabilities to integrated quantum systems that can enable wireless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Space-time Metallic Metasurfaces for Frequency Conversion and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper details a class of metal-based space-time metasurfaces for application in wireless communications scenarios. Concretely, we describe space-time metasurfaces that periodically alternate their properties in time between three spatial states: "air", "conductor" and "grating". We analyze the physics of these metastructures via a computationally-efficient analytical technique based on the use of Floquet-Bloch series, integral equations and circuit models. By doing so, we reveal important features of these spatiotemporal metasurfaces: scattering parameters, field profiles, diffraction angles and nature of the space-time harmonics. The results, corroborated with a self-implemented numerical FDTD approach, show the potential application of these space-time metasurfaces as beamformers acting in reflection, in transmission or both. The amplitude and direction of the diffracted orders can be electronically controlled with the paramaters of the metasurface. Moreover, the intrinsic ability of time-modulated diffractive metasurfaces to mix and multiply frequencies is tested. We show how two different modulations can lead to the same diffraction angle but with different mixed output frequencies.</description>

      <title>Elasticity-Controlled Jamming Criticality in Soft Composite Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft composite solids are made of inclusions dispersed within soft matrices. They are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis of many biological tissues. In the field of materials science, synthetic soft composites are promising candidates for building various engineering devices due to their highly programmable features. However, when the volume fraction of the inclusions increases, predicting the mechanical properties of these materials poses a significant challenge for the classical theories of composite mechanics. The difficulty arises from the inherently disordered, multi-scale interactions between the inclusions and the matrix. To address this challenge, we systematically investigated the mechanics of densely filled soft elastomers containing stiff microspheres. We experimentally demonstrated how the strain-stiffening response of the soft composites is governed by the critical scalings in the vicinity of a shear-jamming transition of the included particles. The proposed criticality framework quantitatively connects the overall mechanics of a soft composite with the elasticity of the matrix and the particles, and captures the diverse mechanical responses observed across a wide range of material parameters. The findings uncover a novel design paradigm of composite mechanics that relies on engineering the jamming properties of the embedded inclusions.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Barium hexaferrite-based nanocomposites as Random Magnets for microwave absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work reports experimental evidence of random magnetic behavior observed in modified barium hexagonal ferrites. A significant transition in the magnetic properties of this system is observed when divalent cations (Ni2+, Cu2+, Mn2+) are introduced in the structure and give rise to a magnetic nanocomposite. Such introduction takes place in a random manner throughout each sample and creates the conditions for such materials to behave as random magnets. We verify the occurrence of such behavior in our samples by fitting the magnetization in approaching saturation to the corresponding theoretical model. We therefore analyze the microwave absorption capacities of random magnets in the GHz range and predict large and broad absorption signals under certain conditions. The findings presented here postulate, for the first time, ceramic materials as promising random magnets and underline their potential as microwave absorbers, in good agreement with recent theoretical models.</description>
