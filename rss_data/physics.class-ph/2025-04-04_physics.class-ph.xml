      <title>Droplet-on-demand using a positive pressure pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet generation under steady conditions is a common microfluidic method for producing biphasic systems. However, this process works only over a limited range of imposed pressure: beyond a critical value, a stable liquid jet can instead form. Furthermore, for a given geometry the pressure conditions set both the generation rate of droplets and their volume. Here, we report on-demand droplet production using a positive pressure pulse to the dispersed-phase inlet of a flow-focusing geometry. This strategy enables confined droplet generation within and beyond the pressure range observed under steady conditions, and decouples volume and production rate. In particular, elongated plugs not possible under steady conditions may be formed when the maximal pressure during the pulse reaches the jet regime. The measured volume of droplets-on-demand, as well as the onset of droplet generation are both captured with a simple model that considers hydraulic resistances. This work provides a strategy and design rules for processes that require individual droplets or elongated plugs in a simple microfluidic chip design.</description>

      <title>Exact characterization of anisotropic properties in confined hard-sphere systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) system of hard spheres confined within a cylindrical pore so narrow that only nearest-neighbor interactions are possible. By mapping the Q1D system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive hard rods, we obtain exact thermodynamic and structural properties, including the radial distribution function, which had remained elusive in previous studies. We derive analytical expressions for limiting cases, such as small pore diameters, virial coefficients, and extreme pressures. Additionally, we identify a transition in the anisotropic pressure components, where the transverse pressure surpasses the longitudinal one at high densities if the pore diameter exceeds a critical threshold. Finally, we analyze spatial correlations in particle arrangements and fluctuations in radial positioning, providing insight into the emergence of ordering in confined systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Nonlinear Dynamics for Time-Driven Berry Phase in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phases arising from cyclic processes are fundamental in physics, bridging quantum and classical domains and providing deeper insights into the topology and dynamics of physical systems. This study investigates the accumulation of a time-driven Berry phase in a classical nonlinear system comprised of two spherical granules and introduces a method in which gauge variants naturally evolve over time without altering internal or external conditions. We develop a perturbation-based model to map the system's elastic characteristics to Bloch states and confirm the theoretical predictions of the frequency-dependent Berry phase through experiments. Our findings reveal that the Berry phase can exhibit trivial and nontrivial values, influenced by external driving forces and static precompression. Our results demonstrate a rich array of vibrational modes, capable of displaying identical Berry phase signatures across different frequencies-a significant departure from previous studies that identified a single topological resonance. Multiple nontrivial Berry phases emerge in highly nonlinear settings, whereas more linear regimes exhibit a singular nontrivial phase. Notably, the behavior of the Berry phase in our system mirrors fundamental quantum mechanics concepts, such as path-dependent state evolution. This study highlights the potential of classical mechanical systems to mimic quantum phenomena, opening new pathways for quantum-inspired topological computation and offering fresh perspectives on using time-driven Berry phase accumulation to investigate topological properties in nonlinear media.</description>
