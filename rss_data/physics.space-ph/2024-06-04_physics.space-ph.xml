      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using dbscan, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate its efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as in-situ satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of the aurora. We discuss instances when this prediction is brought to fruition and when it ostensibly is not. Through case studies, we highlight the important instances when the radar echo bulk motions vary considerably around discrete auroral arcs, an effect we argue is produced by strong electric field modulations caused by energetic particle precipitation.</description>

      <title>Seasonal variation in nighttime NO radiative cooling as observed by TIMED/SABER in lower thermosphere during solar maximum and solar minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both composition and temperature play a crucial role in determining the NO radiative cooling in lower thermosphere as observed by TIMED/SABER. In this work, we present a detailed investigation of seasonal variation in thermospheric NO radiative cooling. We have carried forward the investigation of \cite{li2018} regarding the variations in local nighttime peak NO radiative cooling and its altitude during solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. By analyzing latitudinal changes over quiet times for each month in year 2018, it is evident that both the investigative parameters exhibit summer-winter variability. The qualitative contribution of different species (i.e., NO, and O), and temperatures in determining the vertical profile of NO radiative cooling for different latitudes is investigated by utilizing the NRLMSISE-00 estimated parameters, and SNOE observed NO density. The temperature, NO density, meridional wind, and associated compositional variations due to asymmetrical solar heating in both the hemispheres during solar minimum conditions seem to be the dominating factor in controlling the NO radiative cooling during different seasons. The altitudes at which maximum cooling by NO occurs exhibits an inverse correlation with the amount of radiative cooling. The region of enhanced NO densities (polar and summer hemispheric low-mid latitude regions) have larger NO radiative cooling with lower peak altitudes in comparison to other regions (equatorial to winter hemispheric low-mid latitude regions), where NO radiative cooling is low with higher peak altitude values.</description>

      <title>PreMevE-MEO: Predicting Ultra-relativistic Electrons Using Observations from GPS Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic electrons with energies greater than or equal to two megaelectron-volt (MeV) pose a major radiation threat to spaceborne electronics, and thus specifying those highly energetic electrons has a significant meaning to space weather communities. Here we report the latest progress in developing our predictive model for MeV electrons in the outer radiation belt. The new version, primarily driven by electron measurements made along medium-Earth-orbits (MEO), is called PREdictive MEV Electron (PreMevE)-MEO model that nowcasts ultra-relativistic electron flux distributions across the whole outer belt. Model inputs include above 2 MeV electron fluxes observed in MEOs by a fleet of GPS satellites as well as electrons measured by one Los Alamos satellite in the geosynchronous orbit. We developed an innovative Sparse Multi-Inputs Latent Ensemble NETwork (SmileNet) which combines convolutional neural networks with transformers, and we used long-term in-situ electron data from NASA's Van Allen Probes mission to train, validate, optimize, and test the model.It is shown that PreMevE-MEO can provide hourly nowcasts with high model performance efficiency and high correlation with observations.This prototype PreMevE-MEO model demonstrates the feasibility of making high-fidelity predictions driven by observations from longstanding space infrastructure in MEO, thus has great potential of growing into an invaluable space weather operational warning tool.</description>

      <title>Ohm's Law, the Reconnection Rate, and Energy Conversion in Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous plasma process that transforms magnetic energy into particle energy during eruptive events throughout the universe. Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories. Finally, future prospects and open questions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Glitch Subtraction Systems for Enhancing Gravitational Wave Data Analysis: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glitches are transitory noise artifacts that degrade the detection sensitivity and accuracy of interferometric observatories such as LIGO and Virgo in gravitational wave astronomy. Reliable glitch subtraction techniques are essential for separating genuine gravitational wave signals from background noise and improving the accuracy of astrophysical investigations. This review study summarizes the main glitch subtraction methods used in the industry. We talk about the efficacy of classic time-domain techniques in real-time applications, like matched filtering and regression methods. The robustness of frequency-domain approaches, such as wavelet transformations and spectral analysis, in detecting and mitigating non-stationary glitches is assessed. We also investigate sophisticated machine learning methods, demonstrating great potential in automatically identifying and eliminating intricate glitch patterns. We hope to provide a thorough understanding of these approaches' uses, difficulties, and potential for future development in gravitational wave data analysis by contrasting their advantages and disadvantages. Researchers looking to enhance glitch subtraction procedures and raise the accuracy of gravitational wave detections will find great value in this paper.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

      <title>Beam-driven Electron Cyclotron Harmonic and Electron Acoustic Waves as Seen in Particle-In-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent study has demonstrated that electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves can be excited by a low energy electron beam. Such waves propagate at moderately oblique wave normal angles (~70). The potential effects of beam-driven ECH waves on electron dynamics in Earth's plasma sheet is not known. Using two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell simulations with initial electron distributions that represent typical plasma conditions in the plasma sheet, we explore the excitation and saturation of such beam-driven ECH waves. Both ECH and electron acoustic waves are excited in the simulation and propagate at oblique wave normal angles. Compared with the electron acoustic waves, ECH waves grow much faster and have more intense saturation amplitudes. Cold, stationary electrons are first accelerated by ECH waves through cyclotron resonance and then accelerated in the parallel direction by both the ECH and electron acoustic waves through Landau resonance. Beam electrons, on the other hand, are decelerated in the parallel direction and scattered to larger pitch angles. The relaxation of the electron beam and the continuous heating of the cold electrons contribute to ECH wave saturation and suppress the excitation of electron acoustic waves. When the ratio of plasma to electron cyclotron frequency wpe/wce increases, the ECH wave amplitude increases while the electron acoustic wave amplitude decreases. Our work reveals the importance of ECH and electron acoustic waves in reshaping sub-thermal electron distributions and improves our understanding on the potential effects of wave-particle interactions in trapping ionospheric electron outflows and forming anisotropic (field-aligned) electron distributions in the plasma sheet.</description>

      <title>The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged for planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.</description>
