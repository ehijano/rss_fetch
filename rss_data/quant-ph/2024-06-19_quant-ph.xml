      <title>Hyperdimensional Quantum Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum algorithm for efficiently decoding hypervectors, a crucial process in extracting atomic elements from hypervectors - an essential task in Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) models for interpretable learning and information retrieval. HDC employs high-dimensional vectors and efficient operators to encode and manipulate information, representing complex objects from atomic concepts. When one attempts to decode a hypervector that is the product (binding) of multiple hypervectors, the factorization becomes prohibitively costly with classical optimization-based methods and specialized recurrent networks, an inherent consequence of the binding operation. We propose HDQF, an innovative quantum computing approach, to address this challenge. By exploiting parallels between HDC and quantum computing and capitalizing on quantum algorithms' speedup capabilities, HDQF encodes potential factors as a quantum superposition using qubit states and bipolar vector representation. This yields a quadratic speedup over classical search methods and effectively mitigates Hypervector Factorization capacity issues.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic high-fidelity spin polarization of charged vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has garnered significant attention among defects in two-dimensional materials. This owes, in part, to its deterministic generation, well-characterized atomic structure, and optical polarizability at room temperature. We investigate the latter through extensive measurements probing both the ground and excited state polarization dynamics. We develop a semiclassical model based on these measurements that predicts a near-unity degree of spin polarization, surpassing other solid-state spin defects under ambient conditions. Building upon our model, we include the presence of nuclear spin degrees of freedom adjacent to the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ and perform a comprehensive set of Lindbladian numerics to investigate the hyperfine-induced polarization of the nuclear spins. Our simulations predict a number of important features that emerge as a function of magnetic field which are borne out by experiment.</description>

      <title>Linear response theory for cavity QED materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for linear response theory in cavity QED materials. Our approach leverages the collective coupling between light and matter, drawing parallels with large-N theories in quantum field theory. We derive closed formulas for various responses of both the cavity and the matter. Our theory is validated by recovering established results for the Dicke model and the Quantum Hall Effect. Additionally, we discover novel excitations in quantum magnets, where the cavity binds magnon pairs into localized states.</description>

      <title>Stripping Quantum Decision Diagrams of their Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical representations of quantum states and operations as vectors and matrices are plagued by an exponential growth in memory and runtime requirements for increasing system sizes. Based on their use in classical computing, an alternative data structure known as Decision Diagrams (DDs) has been proposed, which, in many cases, provides both a more compact representation and more efficient computation. In the classical realm, decades of research have been conducted on DDs and numerous variations tailored for specific applications exist. However, DDs for quantum computing are just in their infancy and there is still room for tailoring them to this new technology. In particular, existing representations of DDs require extending all operations in a quantum circuit to the full system size through extension by nodes representing identity matrices. In this work, we make an important step forward for quantum DDs by stripping these identity structures from quantum operations. This significantly reduces the number of nodes required to represent them as well as eases the pressure on key building blocks of their implementation. As a result, we obtain a structure that is more natural for quantum computing and significantly speeds up with computations-with a runtime improvement of up to 70x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED materials: Comparison and validation of two linear response theories at arbitrary light-matter coupling strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for materials collectively coupled to a cavity that is valid in all regimes of light-matter coupling, including symmetry-broken phases. We present and compare two different approaches. First, using a coherent path integral formulation for the partition function to obtain thermal Green functions. This approach relies on a saddle point expansion for the action, that can be truncated in the thermodynamic limit. Second, by formulating the equations of motion for the retarded Green functions and solving them. We use a mean-field decoupling of high-order Green functions in order to obtain a closed, solvable system of equations. Both approaches yield identical results in the calculation of response functions for the cavity and material. These are obtained in terms of the bare cavity and material responses. In combination, the two techniques clarify the validity of a mean-field decoupling in correlated light-matter systems and provide complementary means to compute finite-size corrections to the thermodynamic limit. The theory is formulated for a general model that encompasses most of the systems typically considered in the field of cavity QED materials, within a long-wavelength approximation. Finally, we provide a detailed application of the theory to the Quantum Hall effect and to a collection of magnetic models. We validate our predictions against analytical and finite-size exact-diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Operator-based quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, which links the uncertainties of the position and momentum of a particle, has an important footprint on the quantum behavior of a physical system. Motivated by this principle, we propose that thermodynamic currents associated with work, heat, and internal energy are described by well-defined Hermitian operators; i.e., we associate physical observables to quantum thermodynamic flows. First, we show that, in principle, it is possible to perform single-point measurements to compute average thermodynamic rates. These rates, or currents, differ from their classical counterparts due to the non-commutativity of the corresponding operators. Using the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation, we then obtain various thermodynamic uncertainty relationships between them. In particular, we connect the fluctuations in heat rate and thermodynamic power with those in internal energy. We further illustrate this approach by applying it to quantum batteries, where we derive an energy-power uncertainty relationship and show how measurements affect the fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Constrained dynamics and confinement in the two-dimensional quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the quantum Ising model on two-dimensional square lattices up to $16 \times 16$ spins. In the ordered phase, the model is predicted to exhibit dynamically constrained dynamics, leading to confinement of elementary excitations and slow thermalization. After demonstrating the signatures of confinement, we probe the dynamics of interfaces in the constrained regime through sudden quenches of product states with domains of opposite magnetization. We find that the nature of excitations can be captured by perturbation theory throughout the confining regime, and identify the crossover to the deconfining regime. We systematically explore the effect of the transverse field on the modes propagating along flat interfaces and investigate the crossover from resonant to diffusive melting of a square of flipped spins embedded in a larger lattice.</description>

      <title>Witnessing network steerability of every bipartite entangled state without inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement and nonlocality are key resources for most of the quantum information protocols. It is well-established now that every entangled state is nonlocal with respect to semi-quantum games. However, there is a lack of witnesses that can used to observe any form of nonlocality of every entangled state. In this work, we focus on the swap-steering scenario without inputs and find linear witnesses of network steerability corresponding to any negative partial transpose (NPT) bipartite state and a large class of bipartite states that violate the computable cross-norm (CCN) criterion. Furthermore, by considering that the trusted party can perform tomography of the incoming subsystems, we construct linear inequalities to witness swap-steerability of every bipartite entangled state. Consequently, for every bipartite entangled state one can now observe a form of quantum nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Supervised binary classification of small-scale digits images with a trapped-ion quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the results of benchmarking of a quantum processor based on trapped $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions by performing basic quantum machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we carry out a supervised binary classification of small-scale digits images, which are intentionally chosen so that they can be classified with 100% accuracy, using a quantum-enhanced Support Vector Machine algorithm with up to four qubits. In our work, we specifically consider different types of quantum encodings of the dataset and different levels of transpilation optimizations for the corresponding quantum circuits. For each quantum encoding, we obtain a classifier that is of 100% accuracy on both training and test sets, which demonstrates that the quantum processor can correctly solve the basic classification task considered. As we expect, with the increase of the capabilities quantum processors, they can become a useful tool for machine learning.</description>

      <title>QC-Forest: a Classical-Quantum Algorithm to Provably Speedup Retraining of Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a popular tree-ensemble method for supervised learning, prized for its ease of use and flexibility. Online RF models require to account for new training data to maintain model accuracy. This is particularly important in applications were data is periodically and sequentially generated over time in data streams, such as auto-driving systems, and credit card payments. In this setting, performing periodic model retraining with the old and new data accumulated is beneficial as it fully captures possible drifts in the data distribution over time. However, this is unpractical with state-of-the-art classical algorithms for RF as they scale linearly with the accumulated number of samples. We propose QC-Forest, a classical-quantum algorithm designed to time-efficiently retrain RF models in the streaming setting for multi-class classification and regression, achieving a runtime poly-logarithmic in the total number of accumulated samples. QC-Forest leverages Des-q, a quantum algorithm for single tree construction and retraining proposed by Kumar et al. by expanding to multi-class classification, as the original proposal was limited to binary classes, and introducing an exact classical method to replace an underlying quantum subroutine incurring a finite error, while maintaining the same poly-logarithmic dependence. Finally, we showcase that QC-Forest achieves competitive accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art RF methods on widely used benchmark datasets with up to 80,000 samples, while significantly speeding up the model retrain.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Classes of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECC's) are needed to combat the inherent noise affecting quantum processes. Using ZX calculus, we represent QECC's in a form called a ZX diagram, consisting of a tensor network. In this paper, we present canonical forms for CSS codes and CSS states (which are CSS codes with 0 inputs), and we show the resulting canonical forms for the toric code and certain surface codes. Next, we introduce the notion of prime code diagrams, ZX diagrams of codes that have a single connected component with the property that no sequence of rewrite rules can split such a diagram into two connected components. We also show the Fundamental Theorem of Clifford Codes, proving the existence and uniqueness of the prime decomposition of Clifford codes. Next, we tabulate equivalence classes of ZX diagrams under a different definition of equivalence that allows output permutations and any local operations on the outputs. Possible representatives of these equivalence classes are analyzed. This work expands on previous works in exploring the canonical forms of QECC's in their ZX diagram representations.</description>

      <title>A shortcut to an optimal quantum linear system solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a linear system of equations $A\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{b}$, quantum linear system solvers (QLSSs) approximately prepare a quantum state $|\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$ for which the amplitudes are proportional to the solution vector $\boldsymbol{x}$. Asymptotically optimal QLSSs have query complexity $O(\kappa \log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of $A$, and $\varepsilon$ is the approximation error. However, runtime guarantees for existing optimal and near-optimal QLSSs do not have favorable constant prefactors, in part because they rely on complex or difficult-to-analyze techniques like variable-time amplitude amplification and adiabatic path-following. Here, we give a conceptually simple QLSS that does not use these techniques. If the solution norm $\lVert\boldsymbol{x}\rVert$ is known exactly, our QLSS requires only a single application of kernel reflection (a straightforward extension of the eigenstate filtering (EF) technique of previous work) and the query complexity of the QLSS is $(1+O(\varepsilon))\kappa \ln(2\sqrt{2}/\varepsilon)$. If the norm is unknown, our method allows it to be estimated up to a constant factor using $O(\log\log(\kappa))$ applications of kernel projection (a direct generalization of EF) yielding a straightforward QLSS with near-optimal $O(\kappa \log\log(\kappa)\log\log\log(\kappa)+\kappa\log(1/\varepsilon))$ total complexity. Alternatively, by reintroducing a concept from the adiabatic path-following technique, we show that $O(\kappa)$ complexity can be achieved for norm estimation, yielding an optimal QLSS with $O(\kappa\log(1/\varepsilon))$ complexity while still avoiding the need to invoke the adiabatic theorem. Finally, we compute an explicit upper bound of $56\kappa+1.05\kappa \ln(1/\varepsilon)+o(\kappa)$ for the complexity of our optimal QLSS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports the experimental characterization at the cryogenic temperature of a compact mm-wave broadband single-pole single-throw (SPST) switch in 22nm FDSOI CMOS technology. The switch consists of two n-MOSFETs with a special device option to reduce the substrate parasitic effects, and a third n-MOSFET to improve isolation. Unlike prior wideband mm-wave switches, it does not require any large passive components, allowing a very compact design, low loss and high isolation performance. The cryogenic measurements at 2 K show an insertion loss lower than 2.3 dB, an isolation better than 25.3 dB, and the return loss better than -11.5 dB, over the entire frequency range from DC to 70 GHz.</description>

      <title>Efficient particle-conserving brick-wall quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In variational quantum optimization with particle-conserving quantum circuits, it is often difficult to decide a priori which particle-conserving gates and circuit ansatzes would be most efficient for a given problem. This is important especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors with limited resources. While this may be challenging to answer in general, deciding which particle-conserving gate would be most efficient is easier within a specified circuit ansatz. In this paper, we show how to construct efficient particle-conserving gates using some practical ideas from symmetric tensor networks. We derive different types of particle-conserving gates, including the generalized one. We numerically test the gates under the framework of brick-wall circuits. We show that the general particle-conserving gate with only four real parameters is generally best. In addition, we present an algorithm to extend brick-wall circuit with two-qubit nearest-neighbouring gates to non-nearest-neighbouring gates. We test and compare the efficiency of the circuits with Heisenberg spin chain with and without next-nearest-neighbouring interactions.</description>

      <title>The Local Account of Bell Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the century-long history of quantum theory, Bell's theorem stands out among the most thought-provoking results of its foundations. It reveals a conflict between quantum theory's predictions and those allowed by a general framework aligning with locality and realism. Experimental vindications of the quantum predictions were of Nobel-Prize merit and contributed to an established conclusion that nature is non-local. In stark contrast with this orthodoxy, I show that within the Heisenberg picture of unitary quantum theory, Bell inequalities are violated with local elements of reality interacting locally. Here is how: Upon measuring her particle of the entangled pair, Alice smoothly and locally evolves into two non-interacting versions of herself, each of which witnesses and records a different outcome -- she \emph{foliates}. Everything that suitably interacts with the Alices foliates in turn, creating worlds which, for all practical purposes, are independent and autonomous. At spacelike separation, an analogous process occurs to Bob when he measures his particle, locally differentiating him and his surroundings into two non-interacting instances. To confirm the violation of Bell inequalities, Alice and Bob must further interact to produce a record of the joint outcomes. The record arises from the two local worlds of Alice, and those of Bob, and foliates into four instances that respectively indicate `$00$', `$01$', `$10$' and `$11$'. If at least one input of the CHSH test is `$0$', the total measure of records displaying the same outcome is $\cos^2(\pi/8)$; if not, this measure pertains to the records of different outcomes. This article formalizes and explains this local account of Bell `nonlocality'.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compiling with Reinforcement Learning on a Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To effectively implement quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors is a central task in modern quantum technology. NISQ processors feature tens to a few hundreds of noisy qubits with limited coherence times and gate operations with errors, so NISQ algorithms naturally require employing circuits of short lengths via quantum compilation. Here, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based quantum compiler for a superconducting processor and demonstrate its capability of discovering novel and hardware-amenable circuits with short lengths. We show that for the three-qubit quantum Fourier transformation, a compiled circuit using only seven CZ gates with unity circuit fidelity can be achieved. The compiler is also able to find optimal circuits under device topological constraints, with lengths considerably shorter than those by the conventional method. Our study exemplifies the codesign of the software with hardware for efficient quantum compilation, offering valuable insights for the advancement of RL-based compilers.</description>

      <title>The Duan-Kimble cavity-atom quantum memory loading scheme revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reexamine the well-known Duan-Kimble entanglement scheme, wherein the state of a single-photon qubit is entangled with a quantum memory consisting of a single-atom qubit in a strongly coupled optical cavity, providing the capability to load the photon's state into the memory. We correct a common error appearing in some subsequent papers regarding the validity of the single-photon reflectivity function that characterizes the essential phase shift at the heart of the protocol. Using the validated analytical solution, we introduce an improved scheme-the push-pull configuration-where the photon and cavity are tuned at the midpoint between atomic resonances and show that it can outperform the original on-off configuration in which the photon and cavity are tuned exactly to one of the atomic resonances. The performance metric used is the final memory-state fidelity versus the heralding probability, which determines the memory loading rate. The results should play a role in optimizing future quantum repeater schemes based on the Duan-Kimble protocol.</description>

      <title>Path Percolation in Quantum Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a quantum communication network, links represent entanglement between qubits located at different nodes. Even if two nodes are not directly linked by shared entanglement, communication channels can be established between them via quantum routing protocols. However, in contrast to classical communication networks, each communication event removes all participating links along the communication path, disrupting the quantum network. Here, we propose a simple model, where randomly selected pairs of nodes communicate through shortest paths. Each time such a path is used, all participating links are eliminated, leading to a correlated percolation process that we call ``path percolation.'' We study path percolation both numerically and analytically and present the phase diagram of the steady states as a function of the rate at which new links are being added to the quantum communication network. As a key result, the steady state is found to be independent from the initial network topology when new link are added randomly between disconnected components. We close by discussing extensions of path percolation and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>

      <title>Transversal CNOT gate with multi-cycle error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalable and programmable quantum computer holds the potential to solve computationally intensive tasks that classical computers cannot accomplish within a reasonable time frame, achieving quantum advantage. However, the vulnerability of the current generation of quantum processors to errors poses a significant challenge towards executing complex and deep quantum circuits required for practical problems. Quantum error correction codes such as Stabilizer codes offer a promising path forward for fault-tolerant quantum computing, however their realisation on quantum hardware is an on-going area of research. In particular, fault-tolerant quantum processing must employ logical gates on logical qubits with error suppression with realistically large size codes. This work has implemented a transversal CNOT gate between two logical qubits constructed using the Repetition code with flag qubits, and demonstrated error suppression with increasing code size under multiple rounds of error detection. By performing experiments on IBM quantum devices through cloud access, our results show that despite the potential for error propagation among logical qubits during the transversal CNOT gate operation, increasing the number of physical qubits from 21 to 39 and 57 can suppress errors, which persists over 10 rounds of error detection. Our work establishes the feasibility of employing logical CNOT gates alongside error detection on a superconductor-based processor using current generation quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relations based on state-dependent norm of commutator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two uncertainty relations based on the state-dependent norm of commutators, utilizing generalizations of the B\"ottcher-Wenzel inequality. The first relation is mathematically proven, while the second, tighter relation is strongly supported by numerical evidence. Both relations surpass the conventional Robertson and Schr\"odinger bounds, particularly as the quantum state becomes increasingly mixed. This reveals a previously undetected complementarity of quantum uncertainty, stemming from the non-commutativity of observables. We also compare our results with the Luo-Park uncertainty relation, demonstrating that our bounds can outperform especially for mutually unbiased observables.</description>

      <title>Evolution Dynamics Toward the Limit Cycle of a Quantum Self-Sustained Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum self-sustained oscillator as it evolves toward its limit cycle may be useful in solving related problems like those in quantum synchronization, yet is inadequately studied. Here we investigate the evolution of a quantum Rayleigh-van der Pol (RvdP) oscillator, the simplest form of a self-sustained oscillator exhibiting a quasiharmonic limit cycle, starting from Fock, thermal, and coherent states. We find that the phase-space dynamics significantly differ depending on the initial state -- one evolution toward the limit cycle may take much longer than another and a least-time parameter may be present. We describe the resulting dynamics in terms of the coherence decay and the redistribution of eigenstate occupation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dynamical localization and precision measurement of BEC micromotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) launched with non-zero initial momentum into a periodically kicked optical lattice creates an asymmetrically localized momentum distribution in a moving frame with a small initial current. This asymmetric localization is investigated under two scenarios; (a) when the BEC is in motion in the laboratory frame and, (b) when the optical lattice is in motion in the laboratory frame. The asymmetric features are shown to arise from the early-time dynamics induced by the broken parity symmetry and, asymptotically, freeze as the dynamical localization stabilizes. The micromotion of BEC is measured using the early-time asymmetry. In this context, micromotion refers to the extremely low initial velocity of the BEC along the lattice direction. This originates from the jitter when the hybrid trap potential is turned off. By employing BEC in a kicked and moving optical lattice, the asymmetry in early-time dynamics is measured to precisely characterize and quantify the micromotion phenomena in the quantum system. Micromotion measurement has applications in quantifying systematic shifts and uncertainties in light-pulse interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores hybrid algorithms that combine classical and quantum computing to enhance the performance of classical algorithms. Two approaches are studied: a hybrid search and sample optimization algorithm and a classical algorithm that assesses the cost and performance of quantum algorithms in chemistry. Hybrid algorithms are vital due to limitations in both classical and quantum computing, offering a solution by leveraging the strengths of both. The first algorithm, quantum Metropolis Solver (QMS), adapts a quantum walk to a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for industrial applications, demonstrating advantages over classical counterparts in various sectors. The second algorithm, TFermion, is a classical tool for evaluating the cost of T-type gates in quantum chemistry algorithms, aiding in the comparison and execution of these algorithms on real quantum hardware, and applied to the design of more efficient electric batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of quantum information between many-qubit states is a subject of fundamental importance in quantum science and technology. We consider entanglement swapping in critical quantum spin chains, where the entanglement between the two chains is induced solely by the Bell-state measurements. We employ a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) approach and describe the measurements as conformal boundary conditions in the replicated field theory. We show that the swapped entanglement exhibits a logarithmic scaling, whose coefficient takes a universal value determined by the scaling dimension of the boundary condition changing operator. We apply our framework to the critical spin-1/2 XXZ chain and determine the universal coefficient by the boundary CFT analysis. We also numerically verify these results by the tensor-network calculations. Possible experimental relevance to Rydberg atom arrays is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present a variational quantum adiabatic theorem, which states that, under certain assumptions, the adiabatic dynamics projected onto a variational manifold follow the instantaneous variational ground state. We focus on low-entanglement variational manifolds and target Hamiltonians with classical ground states. Despite the presence of highly entangled intermediate states along the exact quantum annealing path, the variational evolution converges to the target ground state. We demonstrate this approach with several examples that align with our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Harnessing spontaneous emission of correlated photon pairs from ladder-type giant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of correlated multi-photon processes usually depends on the interaction between nonlinear media and atoms. However, the nonlinearity of optical materials is generally weak, making it still very challenging to achieve correlated multi-photon dynamics at the few-photon level. Meanwhile, giant atoms, with their capability for multi-point coupling, which is a novel paradigm in quantum optics, mostly focus on the single photon field. In this work, using the method described in Phys. Rev. Res. 6. 013279 (2024), we reveal that the ladder-type three-level giant atom spontaneously emits strongly correlated photon pairs with high efficiency by designing and optimizing the target function. In addition, by encoding local phases into the optimal coupling sequence, directional two-photon correlated transfer can be achieved. This method does not require a nonlinear waveguide and can be realized in the conventional environment. We show that the photon pairs emitted in both the bidirectional and the chiral case exhibit strong correlation properties in both time and space. Such correlated photon pairs have great potential applications for quantum information processing. For example, numerical results show that our proposal can realize the two-photon mediated cascaded quantum system.</description>

Abstract: We measure the joint temporal intensity of signal and idler photon pairs generated by spontaneous four wave mixing in a silicon nitride microresonator by time-resolved coincidence detection. This technique can be applied to any high-Q optical cavity whose photon lifetime exceeds the duration of the pump pulse. We tailor the temporal correlation of photon pairs by using a resonant interferometric coupler, a device that allows us to independently tune the quality factors of the pump and signal and idler resonances.Temporal post-selection is used to accurately measure the temporal emission of the device, demonstrating a purity of 98.67(1)%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize an analog model of the general relativity and investigate the influence of spatial curvature on quantum properties of stimulated parametric down-conversion process. For this purpose, we use two-mode sphere coherent state as the input beams of the aforementioned process. These states are realization of coherent states of two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, which lies on a two-dimension sphere. We calculate the entanglement of output states of stimulated parametric down conversion process, measured by linear entropy, and show that it depends on the spatial curvature. So, by preparing the suitable two-mode sphere coherent states, it is possible to control the entanglement between the output states in the laboratory. In addition, we consider mean number and Mandel parameter of the output states of the process and also, their cross-correlation function, as the convince measures of non-classical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Bundle Emissions of Quantum Entangled Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing precise control over multiquanta emission is crucial for quantum information processing, especially when integrated with advanced techniques of manipulating quantum states. Here, by spinning the resonator to induce the Sagnac effect, we can obtain nonreciprocal photon-phonon and photon-magnon super-Rabi oscillations under conditions of optically driving resonance transitions. Opening dissipative channels for such super-Rabi oscillations enables the realization of directional bundle emissions of entangled photon-phonon pairs and photon-magnon pairs by transferring pure multiquanta state to bundled multiquanta outside of the system. This nonreciprocal emission is a flexible switch that can be controlled with precision, and simultaneous emissions of different entangled pairs (such as photon-phonon or photon-magnon pairs) can even emerge but in opposite directions by driving the resonator from different directions. This ability to flexibly manipulate the system allows us to achieve directional entangled multiquanta emitters, and has also potential applications for building hybrid quantum networks and on-chip quantum communications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses conventional photon blockade (CPB) and two-photon blockade (2PB) in a three-wave mixing system embedded with a two-level atom in the high-frequency cavity. Analytical conditions for achieving CPB and 2PB are obtained by analyzing the eigenvalues of the system Hamiltonian. Numerical solutions, derived by solving the master equation in a truncated Fock space, are consistent with the analytical conditions. Detailed analysis of system parameters reveals the influence of the embedded atom on achieving different types of photon blockade. Unlike previous schemes, this system can achieve single-photon blockade simultaneously in three photon modes. Additionally, by adjusting the coupling coefficient between the atom and high-frequency mode photons, the system can switch between single-photon blockade and two-photon blockade in the high-frequency mode.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm to simulate Lindblad master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating a family of Markovian master equations that can be realized through a probabilistic application of unitary channels and state preparation. Our approach employs a second-order product formula for the Lindblad master equation, achieved by decomposing the dynamics into dissipative and Hamiltonian components and replacing the dissipative segments with randomly compiled, easily implementable elements. The sampling approach eliminates the need for ancillary qubits to simulate the dissipation process and reduces the gate complexity in terms of the number of jump operators. We provide a rigorous performance analysis of the algorithm. We also extend the algorithm to time-dependent Lindblad equations, generalize the noise model when there is access to limited ancillary systems, and explore applications beyond the Markovian noise model. A new error bound, in terms of the diamond norm, for second-order product formulas for time-dependent Liouvillians is provided that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Robustness of contextuality under different types of noise as quantifiers for parity-oblivious multiplexing tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised contextuality is a well-motivated notion of nonclassicality powering up a myriad of quantum tasks, among which is the celebrated case of a two-party information processing task where classical information is compressed in a quantum channel, the parity-oblivious multiplexing (POM) task. The success rate is the standard quantifier of resourcefulness for this task, while robustness-based quantifiers are as operationally motivated and have known general properties. In this work, we leverage analytical and numerical tools to estimate robustness of contextuality in POM scenarios under different types of noise. We conclude that for the 3-to-1 case the robustness of contextuality to depolarisation, as well as a minimisation of the robustness of contextuality to dephasing over all bases, are good quantifiers for the nonclassical advantage of this scenario. Moreover, we obtain a general relation between robustness of contextuality to depolarisation and the success rate in any $n$-to-1 POM scenario and show how it can be used to bound the number of bits encoded in this task.</description>

      <title>Realizing string-net condensation: Fibonacci anyon braiding for universal gates and sampling chromatic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibonacci string-net condensate, a complex topological state that supports non-Abelian anyon excitations, holds promise for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. However, its realization by a static-lattice Hamiltonian has remained elusive due to the inherent high-order interactions demanded. Here, we introduce a scalable dynamical string-net preparation (DSNP) approach, suitable even for near-term quantum processors, that can dynamically prepare the state through reconfigurable graphs. DSNP enables the creation and manipulation of the Fibonacci string-net condensate (Fib-SNC). Using a superconducting quantum processor, we couple the DSNP approach with a composite error-mitigation strategy on deep circuits to successfully create, measure, and braid Fibonacci anyons in two spatial dimensions (2D) demonstrating their potential for universal quantum computation. To this end, we measure anyon charges for two species of anyons associated with the doubled topological quantum field theory underlying Fid-SNC, with an average experimental accuracy of 94%. We validate that a scalable 2D braiding operation on a logical qubit encoded on three anyons yields the golden ratio $\phi$ with 98% average accuracy and 8% measurement uncertainty. We further sample the Fib-SNC wavefunction to estimate the chromatic polynomial at $\phi+2$ for various graphs. Given the established computational hardness of the chromatic polynomial, the wavefunction amplitude is classically hard to evaluate. Our results establish the first proof of principle that scalable DSNP can open doors to fault-tolerant universal quantum computation and to classically-hard problems.</description>

      <title>Three-outcome multipartite Bell inequalities: applications to dimension witnessing and spin-nematic squeezing in many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a three-outcome permutationally-invariant Bell inequality, which we show to be naturally suited to explore nonlocal correlations in many-body spin-1 systems or SU(3) models. In the specific, we show how to derive from this inequality experimentally practical Bell correlation witnesses based on the measurement of collective spin components. Moreover, we present approaches that allow us to derive scalable Bell dimension witnesses, namely criteria whose violation signals the impossibility of reproducing the observed statistics by single-particle Hilbert spaces of a certain dimension.This enables the certification of genuine three-level correlations that cannot occur in two-level, i.e. qubit, systems. As an example, we show the application of these witnesses in spin-nematic squeezed states, such as the one that can be prepared in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Towards an Automatic Framework for Solving Optimization Problems with Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing objective functions stands to benefit significantly from leveraging quantum computers, promising enhanced solution quality across various application domains in the future. However, harnessing the potential of quantum solvers necessitates formulating problems according to the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, demanding significant expertise in quantum computation and QUBO formulations. This expertise barrier limits access to quantum solutions.
  Fortunately, automating the conversion of conventional optimization problems into QUBO formulations presents a solution for promoting accessibility to quantum solvers. This article addresses the unmet need for a comprehensive automatic framework to assist users in utilizing quantum solvers for optimization tasks while preserving interfaces that closely resemble conventional optimization practices. The framework prompts users to specify variables, optimization criteria, as well as validity constraints and, afterwards, allows them to choose the desired solver. Subsequently, it automatically transforms the problem description into a format compatible with the chosen solver and provides the resulting solution. Additionally, the framework offers instruments for analyzing solution validity and quality.
  Comparative analysis against existing libraries and tools in the literature highlights the comprehensive nature of the proposed framework. Two use cases (the knapsack problem and linear regression) are considered to show the completeness and efficiency of the framework in real-world applications.
  Finally, the proposed framework represents a significant advancement towards automating quantum computing solutions and widening access to quantum optimization for a broader range of users.</description>

      <title>Exploring Gamification in Quantum Computing: The Qubit Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamification of quantum theory can provide new inroads into the subject: by allowing users to experience simulated worlds that manifest obvious quantum behaviors they can potentially build intuition for quantum phenomena. The Qubit Factory is an engineering-style puzzle game based on a gamified quantum circuit simulator that is designed to provide an introduction to qubits and quantum computing, while being approachable to those with no prior background in the area. It introduces an intuitive visual language for representing quantum states, gates and circuits, further enhanced by animations to aid in visualization. The Qubit Factory presents a hierarchy of increasingly difficult tasks for the user to solve, where each task requires the user to construct and run an appropriate classical/quantum circuit built from a small selection of components. Earlier tasks cover the fundamentals of qubits, quantum gates, superpositions and entanglement. Later tasks cover important quantum algorithms and protocols including superdense coding, quantum teleportation, entanglement distillation, classical and quantum error correction, state tomography, the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, quantum repeaters and more.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Geometric Dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of many-body electron systems can carry internal structure, tied to the quantum geometry of the Hilbert space in which they are embedded. This has been shown explicitly for particle-hole-like excitations, which carry a ``quantum geometric dipole'' (QGD) that is essentially an electric dipole moment associated with the state. We demonstrate in this work that this property can be formulated in a generic way, which does not require wavefunctions expressed in terms of single particle-hole states. Our formulation exploits the density matrix associated with a branch of excitations that evolves continuously with its momentum ${\bf K}$, from which one may extract single-particle states allowing a construction of the QGD. We demonstrate the formulation using the single-mode approximation for excited states of two quantum Hall systems: the first for an integrally filled Landau level, and the second for a fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor $\nu=1/m$, with $m$ an odd integer. In both cases we obtain the same result for the QGD, which can be attributed to the translational invariance assumed of the system. Our study demonstrates that the QGD is an intrinsic property of collective modes which is valid beyond approximations one might make for their wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Unusual charge density wave introduced by Janus structure in monolayer vanadium dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental structural feature, the symmetry of materials determines the exotic quantum properties in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with charge density wave (CDW). Breaking the inversion symmetry, the Janus structure, an artificially constructed lattice, provides an opportunity to tune the CDW states and the related properties. However, limited by the difficulties in atomic-level fabrication and material stability, the experimental visualization of the CDW states in 2D TMDs with Janus structure is still rare. Here, using surface selenization of VTe2, we fabricated monolayer Janus VTeSe. With scanning tunneling microscopy, an unusual root13-root13 CDW state with threefold rotational symmetry breaking was observed and characterized. Combined with theoretical calculations, we find this CDW state can be attributed to the charge modulation in the Janus VTeSe, beyond the conventional electron-phonon coupling. Our findings provide a promising platform for studying the CDW states and artificially tuning the electronic properties toward the applications.</description>

      <title>Driven-Dissipative Dynamics of Ultracold Atoms Trapped in an Array of Harmonic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Role of Spin-Orbit Coupling on the Linear Absorption Spectrum and Intersystem Crossing Rate Coefficients of Ruthenium Polypyridyl Dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successful use of molecular dyes for solar energy conversion requires efficient charge injection, which in turn requires the formation of states with sufficiently long lifetimes (e.g. triplets). The molecular structure elements that confer this property can be found empirically, however computational predictions using $\textit{ab initio}$ electronic structure methods are invaluable to identify structure-property relations for dye sensitizers. The primary challenge for simulations to elucidate the electronic and nuclear origins of these properties is a spin-orbit interaction which drives transitions between electronic states. In this work, we present a computational analysis of the spin-orbit corrected linear absorption cross sections and intersystem crossing rate coefficients for a derivative set of phosphonated tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(2+) dye molecules. After sampling the ground state vibrational distributions, the predicted linear absorption cross sections indicate that the mixture between singlet and triplet states plays a crucial role in defining the line shape of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands in these derivatives. Additionally, an analysis of the intersystem crossing rate coefficients suggests that transitions from the singlet into the triplet manifolds are ultrafast with rate coefficients on the order of $10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ for each dye molecule.</description>

      <title>Interacting Mathieu equation, synchronization dynamics and collision-induced velocity exchange in trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large-scale trapped ion systems have been realized in experiments for quantum simulation and quantum computation. They are the simplest systems for dynamical stability and parametric resonance. In this model, the Mathieu equation plays the most fundamental role for us to understand the stability and instability of a single ion. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of trapped ions with the Coulomb interaction based on the Hamiltonian equation. We show that the many-body interaction will not influence the phase diagram for instability. Then, the dynamics of this model in the large damping limit will also be analytically calculated using few trapped ions. Furthermore, we find that in the presence of modulation, synchronization dynamics can be observed, showing an exchange of velocities between distant ions on the left side and on the right side of the trap. These dynamics resemble to that of the exchange of velocities in Newton's cradle for the collision of balls at the same time. These dynamics are independent of their initial conditions and the number of ions. As a unique feature of the interacting Mathieu equation, we hope this behavior, which leads to a quasi-periodic solution, can be measured in current experimental systems. Finally, we have also discussed the effect of anharmonic trapping potential, showing the desynchronization during the collision process. It is hopped that the dynamics in this many-body Mathieu equation with damping may find applications in quantum simulations. This model may also find interesting applications in dynamics systems as a pure mathematical problem, which may be beyond the results in the Floquet theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically the interplay of spontaneous emission and interactions for the multiple-excited quasistationary eigenstates in a finite periodic array of multilevel atoms coupled to the waveguide. We develop an analytical approach to calculate such eigenstates based on the subradiant dimer basis. Our calculations reveal the peculiar multimerization effect driven by the anharmonicity of the atomic potential: while a general eigenstate is an entangled one, there exist eigenstates that are products of dimers, trimers, or tetramers, depending on the size of the system and the fill factor. At half-filling, these product states acquire a periodic structure with all-to-all connections inside each multimer and become the most subradiant ones.</description>

      <title>Lindblad quantum dynamics from correlation functions of classical spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad quantum master equation is one of the central approaches to the physics of open quantum systems. In particular, boundary driving enables the study of transport, where a steady state emerges in the long-time limit, which features a constant current and a characteristic density profile. While the Lindblad equation complements other approaches to transport in closed quantum systems, it has become clear that a connection between closed and open systems exists in certain cases. Here, we build on this connection for magnetization transport in the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with and without integrability-breaking perturbations. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of the open quantum system can be described on the basis of classical correlation functions, as generated by the Hamiltonian equations of motion for real vectors. By comparing to exact numerical simulations of the Lindblad equation, we demonstrate the accuracy of this description for a range of model parameters, but also point out counterexamples. While this agreement is an interesting physical observation, it also suggests that classical mechanics can be used to solve the Lindblad equation for comparatively large system sizes, which lie outside the possibilities of a quantum mechanical treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how work can be extracted from number-state coherence in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate. With careful tuning of parameters, a sequence of thermodynamically reversible steps transforms a Glauber coherent state into a thermal state with the same energy probability distribution. The work extracted during this process arises entirely from the removal of quantum coherence. More generally, we characterise quantum (from coherence) and classical (remaining) contributions to work output, and find that in this system the quantum contribution can be dominant over a broad range of parameters. The proportion of quantum work output can be further enhanced by squeezing the initial coherent state. Due to the many-body nature of the system, the work from coherence can equivalently be understood as work from entanglement.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Discrete Variable and Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution Protocols with Phase Noise in the Thermal-Loss Channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete-variable (DV) quantum key distribution (QKD) based on single-photon detectors and sources have been successfully deployed for long-range secure key distribution. On the other hand, continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) based on coherent detectors and sources is currently lagging behind in terms of loss and noise tolerance. An important discerning factor between DV-QKD and CV-QKD is the effect of phase noise, which is known to be more relevant in CV-QKD. In this article, we investigate the effect of phase noise on DV-QKD and CV-QKD protocols, including the six-state protocol and squeezed-state protocol, in a thermal-loss channel but with the assumed availability of perfect sources and detectors. We find that in the low phase noise regime but high thermal noise regime, CV-QKD can tolerate more loss compared to DV-QKD. We also compare the secret key rate as an additional metric for the performance of QKD. Requirements for this quantity to be high vastly extend the regions at which CV-QKD performs better than DV-QKD. Our analysis addresses the questions of how phase noise affects DV-QKD and CV-QKD and why the former has historically performed better in a thermal-loss channel.</description>

      <title>Entropy Constraints for Ground Energy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the use of von Neumann entropy constraints for obtaining lower bounds on the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. Known methods for obtaining certificates on the ground energy typically use consistency of local observables and are expressed as semidefinite programming relaxations. The local marginals defined by such a relaxation do not necessarily satisfy entropy inequalities that follow from the existence of a global state. Here, we propose to add such entropy constraints that lead to tighter convex relaxations for the ground energy problem. We give analytical and numerical results illustrating the advantages of such entropy constraints. We also show limitations of the entropy constraints we construct: they are implied by doubling the number of sites in the relaxation and as a result they can at best lead to a quadratic improvement in terms of the matrix sizes of the variables. We explain the relation to a method for approximating the free energy known as the Markov Entropy Decomposition method.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric node placement in fiber-based quantum networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restrictions imposed by existing infrastructure can make it hard to ensure an even spacing between the nodes of future fiber-based quantum networks. We here investigate the negative effects of asymmetric node placement by considering separately the placement of midpoint stations required for heralded entanglement generation, as well as of processing-node quantum repeaters in a chain. For midpoint stations, we describe the effect asymmetry has on the time required to perform one entangling attempt, the success probability of such attempts, and the fidelity of the entangled states created. This includes accounting for the effects of chromatic dispersion on photon indistinguishability. For quantum-repeater chains we numerically investigate how uneven spacing between repeater nodes leads to bottlenecks, thereby increasing both the waiting time and the time states are stored in noisy quantum memory. We find that while the time required to perform one entangling attempt may increase linearly with the midpoint's asymmetry, the success probability and fidelity of heralded entanglement generation and the distribution time and error rate for repeater chains all have vanishing first derivatives with respect to the amount of asymmetry. This suggests resilience of quantum-network performance against small amounts of asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Architecture and protocols for all-photonic quantum repeaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The all-photonic quantum repeater scheme, utilizing a type of graph state called the repeater graph state (RGS), promises resilience to photon losses and operational errors, offering a fast Bell pair generation rate limited only by the RGS creation time (rather than enforced round-trip waits). While existing research has predominantly focused on RGS generation and secret key sharing rate analysis, there is a need to extend investigations to encompass broader applications, such as distributed computation and teleportation, the main tasks envisioned for the Quantum Internet. Here we propose a new emitter-photonic qubit building block and an RGS protocol that addresses several key considerations: end node involvement in connection establishment, decoding of logical qubits within the RGS, and computing the Pauli frame corrections at each participating node to ensure the desired correct end-to-end Bell pair state. Our proposed building block significantly reduces the total number of emissive quantum memories required for end nodes and seamlessly integrates all-photonic and memory-based repeaters under the same communication protocol. We also present an algorithm for decoding logical measurement results, employing graphical reasoning based on graph state manipulation rules.</description>

      <title>On the relation between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be considered as a zeta function over F_1. This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute zeta function. First we deal with a zeta function determined by a time evolution matrix of the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of the quantum walk. Then we prove that the zeta function given by the quantum walk is an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the number of edges of the graph. Furthermore we consider an absolute zeta function for the zeta function based on a quantum walk. As an example, we compute an absolute zeta function for the cycle graph and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma function of order 2.</description>

      <title>Noncompletely Positive Quantum Maps Enable Efficient Local Energy Extraction in Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy extraction from quantum batteries by means of completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps leads to the concept of CPTP-local passive states, which identify bipartite states from which no energy can be squeezed out by applying any CPTP map to a particular subsystem. We prove, for arbitrary dimension, that if a state is CPTP-local passive with respect to a Hamiltonian, then an arbitrary number of copies of the same state - including an asymptotically large one - is also CPTP-local passive. We show further that energy can be extracted efficiently from CPTP-local passive states employing NCPTP but still physically realizable maps on the same part of the shared battery on which operation of CPTP maps were useless. Moreover, we provide the maximum extractable energy using local-CPTP operations, and then, we present an explicit class of states and corresponding Hamiltonians, for which the maximum can be outperformed using physical local NCPTP maps. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition for an arbitrary bipartite state to be unable to supply any energy using non-completely positive trace-preserving (NCPTP) operations on one party with respect to an arbitrary but fixed Hamiltonian. We build an analogy between the relative status of CPTP and NCPTP operations for energy extraction in quantum batteries, and the association of distillable entanglement with entanglement cost for asymptotic local manipulations of entanglement. The surpassing of the maximum energy extractable by NCPTP maps for CPTP-passive as well as for CPTP non-passive battery states can act as detectors of non-CPTPness of quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Limited quantum advantage for stellar interferometry via continuous-variable teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stellar interferometry in the continuous-variable (CV) quantum information formalism and use the quantum Fisher information (QFI) to characterize the performance of three key strategies: direct interferometry (DI), local heterodyne measurement, and a CV teleportation-based strategy. In the lossless regime, we show that a squeezing parameter of $r\approx 2$ (18 dB) is required to reach $\approx$ 95\% of the QFI achievable with DI; such a squeezing level is beyond what has been achieved experimentally. In the low-loss regime, the CV teleportation strategy becomes inferior to DI, and the performance gap widens as loss increases. Curiously, in the high-loss regime, a small region of loss exists where the CV teleportation strategy slightly outperforms both DI and local heterodyne, representing a transition in the optimal strategy. We describe this advantage as limited because it occurs for a small region of loss, and the magnitude of the advantage is also small. We argue that practical difficulties further impede achieving any quantum advantage, limiting the merits of a CV teleportation-based strategy for stellar interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms are not two-level systems, and their rich internal structure often leads to complex phenomena in the presence of light. Here, we analyze off-resonant light scattering including the full hyperfine and magnetic structure. We find a set of frequency detunings where the induced atomic dipole is the same irrespective of the Zeeman state, and where two-photon transitions that alter the atomic state turn off. For alkali atoms and alkaline-earth ions, if the hyperfine splitting is dominated by the magnetic dipole moment contribution, these detunings approximately coincide. Therefore, at a given ``magical'' detuning, all Zeeman states in a hyperfine manifold behave almost identically, and can be traced out to good approximation. This feature prevents state decoherence due to light scattering, which impacts quantum optics experiments and quantum information applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss how a kind of hybrid computation, which employs symbolic, numeric, classic, and quantum algorithms, allows us to conduct Hartree-Fock electronic structure computation of molecules. In the proposed algorithm, we replace the Hartree-Fock equations with a set of equations composed of multivariate polynomials. We transform those polynomials to the corresponding Gr\"obner bases, and then we investigate the corresponding quotient ring, wherein the orbital energies, the LCAO coefficients, or the atomic coordinates are represented by the variables in the ring. In this quotient ring, the variables generate the transformation matrices that represent the multiplication with the monomial bases, and the eigenvalues of those matrices compose the roots of the equation. The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm enables us to record those roots in the quantum states, which would be used in the input data for more advanced and more accurate quantum computations.</description>

Abstract: We analyze theoretically the sensitivity of accelerometry and rotation sensing with a point source interferometer employing large momentum transfer (LMT) and present a design of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can measure rotation around and acceleration along each of the three axes. In this design, the launching technique is used to realize the LMT process without the need to physically change directions of the Raman pulses, thus significantly simplifying the apparatus. We also describe an explicit scheme for such an IMU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Continuous Spontaneous Localisation (CSL) model is the most studied among collapse models, which describes the breakdown of the superposition principle for macroscopic systems. Here, we derive an upper bound on the parameters of the model by applying it to the rotational noise measured in a recent short-distance gravity experiment [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 101101 (2020)]. Specifically, considering the noise affecting the rotational motion, we found that despite being a table-top experiment the bound is only one order of magnitude weaker than that from LIGO for the relevant values of the collapse parameter. Further, we analyse possible ways to optimise the shape of the test mass to enhance the collapse noise by several orders of magnitude and eventually derive stronger bounds that can address the unexplored region of the CSL parameters space.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of online (real-time, single-shot) estimation of static or slow-varying parameters along quantum trajectories in quantum dynamical systems. Based on the measurement signal of a continuously-monitored quantum system, we propose a recursive algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimate of unknown parameters using an approach based on stochastic gradient ascent on the log-likelihood function. We formulate the algorithm in both discrete-time and continuous-time and illustrate the performance of the algorithm through simulations of a simple two-level system undergoing homodyne measurement from which we are able to track multiple parameters simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: The effect of boundaries on the bulk properties of quantum many-body systems is an intriguing subject of study. One can define a boundary effect function, which quantifies the change in the ground state as a function of the distance from the boundary. This function serves as an upper bound for the correlation functions and the entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we perform numerical analyses of the boundary effect function for one-dimensional free-fermion models. We find that the upper bound established by the boundary effect fuction is tight for the examined systems, providing a deep insight into how correlations and entanglement are developed in the ground state as the system size grows. As a by-product, we derive a general fidelity formula for fermionic Gaussian states in a self-contained manner, rendering the formula easier to apprehend.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Profiles in Dual-Unitary Clifford Circuits with Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study temporal entanglement in dual-unitary Clifford circuits with probabilistic measurements preserving spatial unitarity. We exactly characterize the temporal entanglement barrier in the measurement-free regime, exhibiting ballistic growth and decay and a volume-law peak. In the presence of measurements, we relate the temporal entanglement to the scrambling properties of the circuit. For "good scramblers" measurements do not qualitatively change the temporal entanglement profile but only result in a reduced entanglement velocity, whereas for "poor scramblers" the initial ballistic growth of temporal entanglement with bath size is modified to diffusive. This difference is understood through a mapping of the underlying operator dynamics to a biased and an unbiased persistent random walk respectively. In the latter case measurements additionally modify the ballistic decay to the perfect dephaser limit, with vanishing temporal entanglement, to an exponential decay, which we describe through a spatial transfer matrix method. This spatial dynamics is shown to be described by a non-Hermitian hopping model, exhibiting a PT-breaking transition at a critical measurement rate $p=1/2$. In all cases the peak value of the temporal entanglement barrier exhibits volume-law scaling for all measurement rates.</description>

Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate is a widely used entangling gate for ion platforms with inherent robustness to trap heating. The gate performance is limited by coherent errors, arising from the Lamb-Dicke (LD) approximation and sideband errors. Here, we provide explicit analytical formulas for errors up to fourth order in the LD parameter, by using the Magnus expansion to match numerical precision. We show that fourth order Magnus expansion terms are unavoidable, being in fact leading order in LD, and are therefore critical to include for typical target gate fidelities. We show how these errors can be partially compensated using analytical renormalization of the drive strength, by calibration of the Lamb-Dicke parameter, and by the use of smooth pulse shaping.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of entangling and non-local operations in a quantum nondemolition (QND) interaction between multimode light with orbital angular momentum and an atomic ensemble. A protocol consists of two QND operations with rotations of quadratures of atomic spin coherence and light between them. This protocol provides a wide range of two-qubit operations, while the multimode nature of the chosen degrees of freedom allows the implementation of parallel operations over multiple two-qubit systems. We have used the formalism of equivalence classes and local invariants to evaluate the properties of two-qubit transformations. It is shown that, when selecting suitable values of the governing parameters, such as the duration of each of the two QND interactions and the rotation angles of the qubits, the protocol allows to realise a deterministic non-local SWAP operation and entangling $\sqrt{SWAP}$ operation with probability 1/3.</description>

Abstract: Multistability cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a monostable master equation. On the other hand, multistability is experimentally-observed in a variety of quantum systems. A master equation having a nonlinear term that gives rise to disentanglement has been recently proposed . The dynamics governed by this master equation is explored for a quantum system made of coupled spins. It is found that the added nonlinear term can give rise to multistability. The spins' response to an externally applied magnetic field is evaluated, and both a phase transition and a dynamical instability are found. These findings, which originate from disentanglement-induced multistability, indirectly support the hypothesis that spontaneous disentanglement occurs in quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs) are extensively employed in experiments involving weak microwave signals for their highly desirable quantum-limited and broadband characteristics. However, TWPAs' broadband nature comes with the disadvantage of admitting the activation of spurious nonlinear processes, such as harmonics generation, that can potentially degrade amplification performance. Here we experimentally investigate a Josephson TWPA device with SNAIL (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive Element)-based unit cells focusing on the amplification behaviour along with the generation of second and third harmonics of the pump. By comparing experimental results with transient numerical simulations, we demonstrate the influence of Josephson junctions' fabrication imperfections on the occurrence of harmonics and on the gain behaviour.</description>

      <title>Statistics-Informed Parameterized Quantum Circuit via Maximum Entropy Principle for Data Science and Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has demonstrated significant potential in solving practical problems, particularly in statistics-focused areas such as data science and finance. However, challenges remain in preparing and learning statistical models on a quantum processor due to issues with trainability and interpretability. In this letter, we utilize the maximum entropy principle to design a statistics-informed parameterized quantum circuit (SI-PQC) for efficiently preparing and training of quantum computational statistical models, including arbitrary distributions and their weighted mixtures. The SI-PQC features a static structure with trainable parameters, enabling in-depth optimized circuit compilation, exponential reductions in resource and time consumption, and improved trainability and interpretability for learning quantum states and classical model parameters simultaneously. As an efficient subroutine for preparing and learning in various quantum algorithms, the SI-PQC addresses the input bottleneck and facilitates the injection of prior knowledge.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable quantum dynamics require automatic differentiation of a complex-valued initial value problem, which numerically integrates a system of ordinary differential equations from a specified initial condition, as well as the eigendecomposition of a matrix. We explored several automatic differentiation frameworks for these tasks, finding that no framework natively supports our application requirements. We therefore demonstrate a need for broader support of complex-valued, differentiable numerical integration in scientific computing libraries.</description>

      <title>Background resilient quantitative phase microscopy using entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quantum-based quantitative phase microscopy technique using a phase gradient approach that is inherently background resistant and does not rely on interferometry or scanning. Here, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of a position-momentum entangled pair with one photon setup for position measurement in the near-field (NF) of the sample and its partner for momentum measurement in the far-field (FF). By virtue of the spatial correlation property inherent to the entanglement, both the position and momentum information of the photons can thus be obtained simultaneously. The phase profile of the sample is then deduced through a phase gradient measurement obtained by measuring the centroid shift of the photons' in the FF momentum plane for each NF position. We show that the technique, while achieving an imaging resolution of 2.76\,$\mu$m, is phase accurate to at least $\lambda/30$ and phase sensitive to $\lambda/100$ at a wavelength of 810\,nm. In addition, through the temporal correlation between the photon pairs, our technique shows resilience to strong dynamic background lights, which can prove difficult to account for in classical phase imaging techniques. We believe this work marks a significant advancement in the capabilities of quantum phase microscopy and quantum imaging in general, it showcases imaging and phase resolutions approaching those attainable with classical phase microscopes. This advancement brings quantum imaging closer to practical real-world applications, heralding new possibilities in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several combinatorial optimization problems can be solved with NISQ devices once that a corresponding quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form is derived. The aim of this work is to drastically reduce the variables needed for these QUBO reformulations in order to unlock the possibility to efficiently obtain optimal solutions for a class of optimization problems with NISQ devices. This is achieved by introducing novel tools that allow an efficient use of slack variables, even for problems with non-linear constraints, without the need to approximate the starting problem. We divide our new techniques in two independent parts, called the iterative quadratic polynomial and the master-satellite methods. Hence, we show how to apply our techniques in case of an NP-hard optimization problem inspired by a real-world financial scenario called Max-Profit Balance Settlement. We follow by submitting several instances of this problem to two D-wave quantum annealers, comparing the performances of our novel approach with the standard methods used in these scenarios. Moreover, this study allows to appreciate several performance differences between the D-wave Advantage and Advantage2 quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Approximate Contraction of Arbitrary Tensor Networks with a Flexible and Efficient Density Matrix Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network contractions are widely used in statistical physics, quantum computing, and computer science. We introduce a method to efficiently approximate tensor network contractions using low-rank approximations, where each intermediate tensor generated during the contractions is approximated as a low-rank binary tree tensor network. The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms previously proposed approximate tensor network contraction algorithms for multiple problems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.10893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scar states are special finite-energy density, but non-thermal states of chaotic Hamiltonians. We argue that all holographic quantum field theories, including $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang--Mills, have scar states. Their presence is tied to the existence of non-topological, horizonless soliton solutions in gravity: oscillons and a novel family of excited boson stars. We demonstrate that these solutions have periodic oscillations in the correlation functions and posses low-entanglement entropy as expected for scar states. Also we find that they can be very easily prepared with Euclidean path integral.</description>

      <title>Variational optimization of the amplitude of neural-network quantum many-body ground states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQSs), variationally optimized by combining traditional methods and deep learning techniques, is a new way to find quantum many-body ground states and gradually becomes a competitor of traditional variational methods. However, there are still some difficulties in the optimization of NQSs, such as local minima, slow convergence, and sign structure optimization. Here, we split a quantum many-body variational wave function into a multiplication of a real-valued amplitude neural network and a sign structure, and focus on the optimization of the amplitude network while keeping the sign structure fixed. The amplitude network is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual blocks, namely a ResNet. Our method is tested on three typical quantum many-body systems. The obtained ground state energies are lower than or comparable to those from traditional variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Surprisingly, for the frustrated Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model, our results are better than those of the complex-valued CNN in the literature, implying that the sign structure of the complex-valued NQS is difficult to be optimized. We will study the optimization of the sign structure of NQSs in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computed Green's Functions using a Cumulant Expansion of the Lanczos Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantum computational method to calculate the many-body Green's function matrix in a spin orbital basis. We apply our approach to finite-sized fermionic Hubbard models and related impurity models within Dynamical Mean Field Theory, and demonstrate the calculation of Green's functions on Quantinuum's H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. Our approach involves a cumulant expansion of the Lanczos method, using Hamiltonian moments as measurable expectation values. This bypasses the need for a large overhead in the number of measurements due to repeated applications of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and instead measures the expectation value of the moments with one set of measurement circuits. From the measured moments, the tridiagonalised Hamiltonian matrix can be computed, which in turn yields the Green's function via continued fractions. While we use a variational algorithm to prepare the ground state in this work, we note that the modularity of our implementation allows for other (non-variational) approaches to be used for the ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fermionic entanglement entropy for the free Dirac field in a bounded spatial region of Minkowski spacetime. In order to make the system ultraviolet finite, a regularization is introduced. An area law is proven in the limiting cases where the volume tends to infinity and/or the regularization length tends to zero. The technical core of the paper is to generalize a theorem of Harold Widom to pseudo-differential operators whose principal symbols develop a specific discontinuity at a single point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain represents an ubiquitous feature in semiconductor heterostructures, and can be engineered by different means in order to improve the properties of various devices, including advanced MOSFETs and spin-based qubits. However, its treatment within the envelope function framework is well established only for the homogeneous case, thanks to the theory of Bir and Pikus. Here, we generalize such theory to the case of inhomogeneous strain. By fully accounting for the relativistic effects and metric aspects of the problem, we derive a complete envelope-function Hamiltonian, including the terms that depend on first and second spatial derivatives of the strain tensor.</description>

      <title>Dichroic cavity mode splitting and lifetimes from interactions with a ferromagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of ferromagnetic metals (FM) on the circularly polarized modes of an electromagnetic cavity and show that broken time-reversal symmetry leads to a dichroic response of the cavity modes. With one spin-split band, the Zeeman coupling between the FM electrons and cavity modes leads to an anticrossing for mode frequencies comparable to the spin splitting. However, this is only the case for one of the circularly polarized modes, while the other is unaffected by the FM, allowing for the determination of the spin-splitting of the FM using polarization-dependent transmission experiments. Moreover, we show that for two spin-split bands, also the lifetimes of the cavity modes display a polarization-dependent response. The change in photon lifetimes can be understood as a suppression due to level attraction with a continuum of Stoner modes with the same wavevector. The reduced lifetime of modes of only one polarization could potentially be used to engineer and control circularly polarized cavities.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal topological charge pumping in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge pumping in generic non-Hermitian settings and show that quantized charge pumping is only guaranteed under a biorthogonal formalism therein, where the charge transport is evaluated using the left and right eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Specifically, for biorthogonal charge pumping in generic one-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we demonstrate how quantized transport is related to the Chern number in the parameter space. When the non-Hermitian model possesses the non-Hermitian skin effect, under which Bloch states in the bulk are deformed and localize toward boundaries, we propose a scenario where the pumped charge is related to the non-Bloch Chern number defined in the parameter space involving the generalized Brillouin zone. We illustrate the validity of our analytic results using concrete examples and, in the context of the biorthogonal charge pumping, discuss in detail a recent experiment where quantized charge pumping was observed in a lossy environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When subjected to quasiperiodic driving protocols, superconducting systems have been found to harbor robust time-quasiperiodic Majorana modes, extending the concept beyond static and Floquet systems. However, the presence of incommensurate driving frequencies results in dense energy spectra, rendering conventional methods of defining topological invariants based on band structure inadequate. In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this invariant in the presence of dense spectra. Our numerical simulations, focusing on a Kitaev chain driven by two incommensurate frequencies, validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>
