      <title>Efficiency versus Robustness under Tail Misspecification: Importance Sampling and Moment-Based VaR Bracketing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation at high confidence levels is inherently a rare-event problem and is particularly sensitive to tail behavior and model misspecification. This paper studies the performance of two simulation-based VaR estimation approaches, importance sampling and discrete moment matching, under controlled tail misspecification. The analysis separates the nominal model used for estimator construction from the true data-generating process used for evaluation, allowing the effects of heavy-tailed returns to be examined in a transparent and reproducible setting. Daily returns of a broad equity market proxy are used to calibrate a nominal Gaussian model, while true returns are generated from Student-t distributions with varying degrees of freedom to represent increasingly heavy tails. Importance sampling is implemented via exponential tilting of the Gaussian model, and VaR is estimated through likelihood-weighted root-finding. Discrete moment matching constructs deterministic lower and upper VaR bounds by enforcing a finite number of moment constraints on a discretized loss distribution. The results demonstrate a clear trade-off between efficiency and robustness. Importance sampling produces low-variance VaR estimates under the nominal model but systematically underestimates the true VaR under heavy-tailed returns, with bias increasing at higher confidence levels and for thicker tails. In contrast, discrete moment matching yields conservative VaR bracketing that remains robust under tail misspecification. These findings highlight that variance reduction alone is insufficient for reliable tail risk estimation when model uncertainty is significant.</description>

      <title>Dynamic reinsurance via martingale transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a dynamic reinsurance problem in which the insurer seeks to control the terminal distribution of its surplus while minimizing the L2-norm of the ceded risk. Using techniques from martingale optimal transport, we show that, under suitable assumptions, the problem admits a tractable solution analogous to the Bass martingale. We first consider the case where the insurer wants to match a given terminal distribution of the surplus process, and then relax this condition by only requiring certain moment or risk-based constraints.</description>

      <title>ProbFM: Probabilistic Time Series Foundation Model with Uncertainty Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.</description>
