      <title>Motivating Innovation with Misspecified Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new principal-agent framework where a principal communicates a roadmap -- a set of plausible outcome models and a prior belief over them -- to guide an agent who is learning the value of innovation. The agent trusts the prior but fears that each model is misspecified (or incorrect). In dynamic contracting, we find an impossibility result: the agent may fall into a breakthrough trap, where early unexplained success can raise his misspecification concerns to the point that no contract can motivate him to continue innovating. We also obtain an upper bound on the frequency of innovative activity that tightens as the degree of misspecification increases, which then causes innovation cycles to emerge endogenously in the long run. In static contracting, we show that diversifying the roadmap increases the principal's profit by reducing the agent's exposure to idiosyncratic epistemic risk.</description>

      <title>Identification in Stochastic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the identified sets of a wide range of stochastic choice models, including random utility, various models of boundedly-rational behavior, and dynamic discrete choice. In each of these settings, we show two distributions over choice rules are observationally equivalent if and only if they can be obtained from one another via a finite sequence of simple swapping transforms. We leverage this to obtain complete descriptions of both the defining inequalities and extreme points of these identified sets. In cases where choice frequencies vary smoothly with some parameters, we provide a novel global-inverse result for practically testing identification.</description>

      <title>Screening Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal screens an agent with an arbitrary set of allocations $X$. The agent's preferences over allocations are comonotonic. A subset of allocations $X^*\subseteq X$ is a surplus-elasticity frontier if (i) any other allocation has a demand curve that is pointwise lower and less elastic than some allocation in $X^*$ and (ii) the allocations in $X^*$ can be ordered in terms of their demand curves such that a higher demand curve is more inelastic. We show that any surplus-elasticity frontier is an optimal menu. Moreover, if the incremental demand curves along the frontier are also ordered by their elasticities, then the frontier is optimal even among stochastic mechanisms. The result is agnostic to type distributions and redistributive welfare weights -- the same frontier remains optimal for a broad class of objectives. As applications, we show how these results immediately yield new insights into optimal bundling, optimal taxation, sequential screening, selling information, and regulating a data-rich monopolist.</description>

      <title>The Welfare Gap of Strategic Storage: Universal Bounds and Price Non-Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the efficiency of battery storage operations in electricity markets by comparing the social welfare gain achieved by a central planner to that of a decentralized profit-maximizing operator. The problem is formulated in a generalized continuous-time stochastic setting, where the battery follows an adaptive, non-anticipating policy subject to periodicity and other constraints. We quantify the efficiency loss by bounding the ratio of the optimal welfare gain to the gain under profit maximization. First, for linear price functions, we prove that this ratio is tightly bounded by $4/3$. We show that this bound is a structural invariant: it is robust to arbitrary stochastic demand processes and accommodates general convex operational constraints. Second, we demonstrate that the efficiency loss can be unbounded for general convex price functions, implying that convexity alone is insufficient to guarantee market efficiency. Finally, to bridge these regimes, we analyze monomial price functions, where the degree controls the curvature. For specific discrete demand scenarios, we demonstrate that the ratio is bounded by $2$, independent of the degree.</description>

      <title>When is it (im)possible to respect all individuals' preferences under uncertainty?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When aggregating Subjective Expected Utility preferences, the Pareto principle leads to an impossibility result unless the individuals have a common belief. This paper examines the source of this impossibility in more detail by considering the aggregation of a general class of incomplete preferences that can represent gradual ambiguity perceptions. Our result shows that the planner cannot avoid ignoring some individuals unless there is a probability distribution that all individuals agree is most plausible. This means that even if individuals have similar ambiguity perceptions, the impossibility persists as long as some individual's most plausible belief differs even slightly from that of others.</description>

      <title>Anchor-proofness in Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work contributes to a foundational question in economic theory: how do individual-level cognitive biases interact with collective choice mechanisms? We study a setting where voters hold intrinsic preference rankings over a set of alternatives but cast approval ballots to determine the collective outcome. The ballots are shaped by an anchoring bias: alternatives are presented sequentially by a social planner, and a voter approves an alternative if and only if it is acceptable and strictly preferred to all alternatives previously encountered. We first analyze which approval-based voting rules are anchor-proof, in the sense that they always select the same winner regardless of the presentation order. We show that this requirement is extremely demanding: only very restrictive rules satisfy it. We then turn to the potential influence of the social planner. On the upside, when the planner has no information about the voters' intrinsic preferences, she cannot manipulate the outcome.</description>

      <title>Competitive Sequential Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two horizontally differentiated firms compete for consumers who are partially informed about their future preferences. The firms screen consumers by offering menus of option contracts. Each consumer enters contracts with both firms and then, after learning his preferences, purchases one product. We characterize the unique equilibrium. Consumption is distorted because each consumer is endogenously locked into one firm. Nevertheless, with sufficiently early contracting, consumer surplus is higher than under spot pricing because competition is stiffer when consumers are less informed, hence less differentiated; this reverses the conclusion in the monopoly case. Exclusive contracting further benefits consumers by intensifying competition.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Social Pressure on Fundamental Choices: Indecisiveness and Deferral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In mainstream neoclassical economics, utility maximization is the only engine of individual action, and the other or the social, if it is modeled for decisions deemed fundamental, it is done as a tacit externality parameter affecting an agent's maximized payoff. And even when hitched to a social reference point, a fully decisive and immediate response is invariably assumed. In this paper, we propose a non-standard articulation of the trade-off between personal utility and social distance, one motivated by experimental evidence from psychology, management science, and economics. Our approach deconstructs non-recurrent consumer choice to two stages: a non-decisive first stage in which a binary relation, called one-many ordering, yields an interval, the consideration set, to which the deferred choice is confined; a decisive second stage in which the distance from the average social choice, and future social expectations, are taken into account in present utility. Finally, we embed this indecisive consumer in an exploratory game-theoretic setting, and show that indecisiveness and choice deferral may cause social loss.</description>

      <title>On the Fairness of Additive Welfarist Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allocating indivisible goods is a ubiquitous task in fair division. We study additive welfarist rules, an important class of rules which choose an allocation that maximizes the sum of some function of the agents' utilities. Prior work has shown that the maximum Nash welfare (MNW) rule is the unique additive welfarist rule that guarantees envy-freeness up to one good (EF1). We strengthen this result by showing that MNW remains the only additive welfarist rule that ensures EF1 for identical-good instances, two-value instances, as well as normalized instances with three or more agents. On the other hand, if the agents' utilities are integers, we demonstrate that several other rules offer the EF1 guarantee, and provide characterizations of these rules for various classes of instances.</description>
