      <title>Intrusion Detection on Resource-Constrained IoT Devices with Hardware-Aware ML and DL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-aware intrusion detection system (IDS) for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks; it targets scenarios where classification is essential for fast, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient threat detection. The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency. These results highlight the practicality of hardware-constrained model design for real-time IDS at the edge.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Traffic Classification under Resource Constraints: Input Structure Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic classification (TC) plays a critical role in cybersecurity, particularly in IoT and embedded contexts, where inspection must often occur locally under tight hardware constraints. We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over 85% accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial fine-tuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding 96% and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC.</description>

      <title>The xApp Store: A Framework for xApp Onboarding and Deployment in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G and beyond mobile telecommunication networks are increasingly embracing software technologies in their operation and control, similar to what has powered the growth of the cloud. This is most recently seen in the radio access network (RAN). In this new approach, the RAN is increasingly controlled by software applications known as xApps, and opens the door to third party development of xApps bringing diversity to the ecosystem, similar to mobile phone apps. This model aligns closely with the controllers in the ITU-T architecture for autonomous networks, and provides a pathway towards autonomous operation in the RAN. Unfortunately, no marketplace to host or supply xApps currently exists.
  This work describes our experiences in leveraging open-source O-RAN implementations to design and develop an xApp store.</description>

      <title>Coalitional Game Framework for Multicast in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which there is a transmitter and a set of users, all of whom want to download a popular file from the transmitter. Using the framework of cooperative game theory, we investigate conditions under which users have incentives to cooperate among themselves to form coalitions for the purpose of receiving the file via multicast from the transmitter. First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations. The problem of coalition formation in the context of multicast addressed in this paper is fundamental, and our analysis provides new insights into the feasibility of stable cooperative multicast strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of cooperation in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Model-enhanced Multiobjective Optimization for Improving Forest Monitoring Efficiency in UAV-enabled Internet-of-Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\%$ and $9.83\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.</description>

      <title>ProtO-RU: An O-RAN Split-7.2 Radio Unit using SDRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ProtO-RU, the first open source, software-defined O-RAN Split-7.2 Radio Unit built using SDRs and commodity CPUs. Unlike proprietary hardware-based commercial O-RUs, ProtO-RU is built on the open-source srsRAN software stack, and it is fully programmable. We demonstrate that ProtO-RU integrates with the srsRAN and OpenAirInterface5G CU/DU stacks, supports both TDD and FDD duplexing modes, and interoperates with commercial 5G UEs. Our evaluation shows that ProtO-RU remains stable under sustained load with multiple UEs and delivers throughput comparable to Split-8 and commercial O-RUs. ProtO-RU opens up new opportunities for RU-level innovations and lowers the barrier of entry for end-to-end O-RAN research.</description>

      <title>Widening the Coverage of Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization in Wi-Fi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise clock synchronization protocols are increasingly used to ensure that all the nodes in a network share the very same time base. They enable several mechanisms aimed at improving determinism at both the application and communication levels, which makes them highly relevant to industrial environments. Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization (RBIS) is a solution specifically conceived for Wi-Fi that exploits existing beacons and can run on commercial devices. In this paper, an evolution of RBIS is presented, we call DOMINO, whose coverage area is much larger than the single Wi-Fi infrastructure network, potentially including the whole plant. In particular, wireless stations that can see more than one access point at the same time behave as boundary clocks and propagate the reference time across overlapping networks.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Rate Adaptation for Moving Equipment in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi is currently considered one of the most promising solutions for interconnecting mobile equipment (e.g., autonomous mobile robots and active exoskeletons) in industrial environments. However, relability requirements imposed by the industrial context, such as ensuring bounded transmission latency, are a major challenge for over-the-air communication. One of the aspects of Wi-Fi technology that greatly affects the probability of a packet reaching its destination is the selection of the appropriate transmission rate. Rate adaptation algorithms are in charge of this operation, but their design and implementation are not regulated by the IEEE 802.11 standard. One of the most popular solutions, available as open source, is Minstrel, which is the default choice for the Linux Kernel. In this paper, Minstrel performance is evaluated for both static and mobility scenarios. Our analysis focuses on metrics of interest for industrial contexts, i.e., latency and packet loss ratio, and serves as a preliminary evaluation for the future development of enhanced rate adaptation algorithms based on centralized digital twins.</description>

      <title>Rural Connectivity Inequalities in Finland and Sweden: Evidence, Measures, and Policy Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent rural-urban disparities in broadband connectivity remain a major policy challenge, even in digitally advanced countries. This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience. The analysis contributes to ongoing debates on how broadband policy in sparsely populated regions can move beyond nominal coverage targets toward genuine inclusion and reliability.</description>

      <title>ISAC-Powered Distributed Matching and Resource Allocation in Multi-band NTN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalability is a major challenge in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite networks due to the massive number of ground users sharing the limited sub-6 GHz spectrum. Using K- and higher bands is a promising alternative to increase the accessible bandwidth, but these bands are subject to significant atmospheric attenuation, notably rainfall, which can lead to degraded performance and link outages. We present an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-powered framework for resilient and efficient operation of multi-band satellite networks. It is based on distributed mechanisms for atmospheric sensing, cell-to-satellite matching, and resource allocation (RA) in a 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) wide-area scenario with quasi-Earth fixed cells and a beam hopping mechanism. Results with a multi-layer multi-band constellation with satellites operating in the S- and K-bands demonstrate the benefits of our framework for ISAC-powered multi-band systems, which achieves 73% higher throughput per user when compared to single S- and K-band systems.</description>

      <title>Network Self-Configuration based on Fine-Tuned Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, manual configuration becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error. While intent-driven self-configuration using large language models has shown significant promise, such models remain computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and often raise privacy concerns because they typically rely on external cloud infrastructure. This work introduces SLM_netconfig, a fine-tuned small language model framework that uses an agent-based architecture and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to translate configuration intents expressed as natural language requirements or questions into syntactically and semantically valid network configurations. The system is trained on a domain-specific dataset generated through a pipeline derived from vendor documentation, ensuring strong alignment with real-world configuration practices. Extensive evaluation shows that SLM_netconfig, when using its question-to-configuration model, achieves higher syntactic accuracy and goal accuracy than LLM-NetCFG while substantially reducing translation latency and producing concise, interpretable configurations. These results demonstrate that fine-tuned small language models, as implemented in SLM_netconfig, can deliver efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving automated configuration generation entirely on-premise, making them a practical and scalable solution for modern autonomous network configuration.</description>

      <title>Differentially-Private Multi-Tier Federated Learning: A Formal Analysis and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) eliminates the transmission of raw data over a network, it is still vulnerable to privacy breaches from the communicated model parameters. Differential privacy (DP) is often employed to address such issues. However, the impact of DP on FL in multi-tier networks -- where hierarchical aggregations couple noise injection decisions at different tiers, and trust models are heterogeneous across subnetworks -- is not well understood. To fill this gap, we develop \underline{M}ulti-Tier \underline{F}ederated Learning with \underline{M}ulti-Tier \underline{D}ifferential \underline{P}rivacy ({\tt M$^2$FDP}), a DP-enhanced FL methodology for jointly optimizing privacy and performance over such networks. One of the key principles of {\tt M$^2$FDP} is to adapt DP noise injection across the established edge/fog computing hierarchy (e.g., edge devices, intermediate nodes, and other tiers up to cloud servers) according to the trust models in different subnetworks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the convergence behavior of {\tt M$^2$FDP} under non-convex problem settings, revealing conditions on parameter tuning under which the training process converges sublinearly to a finite stationarity gap that depends on the network hierarchy, trust model, and target privacy level. We show how these relationships can be employed to develop an adaptive control algorithm for {\tt M$^2$FDP} that tunes properties of local model training to minimize energy, latency, and the stationarity gap while meeting desired convergence and privacy criterion. Subsequent numerical evaluations demonstrate that {\tt M$^2$FDP} obtains substantial improvements in these metrics over baselines for different privacy budgets and system configurations.</description>

      <title>NASP: Network Slice as a Service Platform for 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With 5G's rapid global uptake, demand for agile private networks has exploded. A defining beyond-5G capability is network slicing. 3GPP specifies three core slice categories, massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC), while ETSI's Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) targets human-less operation. Yet existing documents do not spell out end-to-end (E2E) management spanning multiple domains and subnet instances. We introduce the Network Slice-as-a-Service Platform (NASP), designed to work across 3GPP and non-3GPP networks. NASP (i) translates business-level slice requests into concrete physical instances and inter-domain interfaces, (ii) employs a hierarchical orchestrator that aligns distributed management functions, and (iii) exposes clean south-bound APIs toward domain controllers. A prototype was built by unifying guidance from 3GPP, ETSI, and O-RAN, identifying overlaps and gaps among them. We tested NASP with two exemplary deployments, 3GPP and non-3GPP, over four scenarios: mMTC, URLLC, 3GPP-Shared, and non-3GPP. The Communication Service Management Function handled all requests, underlining the platform's versatility. Measurements show that core-network configuration dominates slice-creation time (68 %), and session setup in the URLLC slice is 93 % faster than in the Shared slice. Cost analysis for orchestrating five versus ten concurrent slices reveals a 112 % delta between edge and centralized deployments. These results demonstrate that NASP delivers flexible, standards-aligned E2E slicing while uncovering opportunities to reduce latency and operational cost.</description>

      <title>CNN-Enabled Scheduling for Probabilistic Real-Time Guarantees in Industrial URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demand a fundamental shift in Radio Access Network (RAN) design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI while leveraging existing infrastructure. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture for unified orchestration and management of telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed architecture enables flexible orchestration, meeting requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.</description>
