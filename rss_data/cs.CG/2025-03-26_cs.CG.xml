      <title>When Distances Lie: Euclidean Embeddings in the Presence of Outliers and Distance Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance geometry explores the properties of distance spaces that can be exactly represented as the pairwise Euclidean distances between points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \geq 1$), or equivalently, distance spaces that can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we investigate whether a distance space can be isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$ after applying a limited number of modifications. Specifically, we focus on two types of modifications: outlier deletion (removing points) and distance modification (adjusting distances between points). The central problem, Euclidean Embedding Editing (EEE), asks whether an input distance space on $n$ points can be transformed, using at most $k$ modifications, into a space that is isometrically embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  We present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) and approximation algorithms for this problem. Our first result is an algorithm that solves EEE in time $(dk)^{\mathcal{O}(d+k)} + n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The core subroutine of this algorithm, which is of independent interest, is a polynomial-time method for compressing the input distance space into an equivalent instance of EEE with $\mathcal{O}((dk)^2)$ points.
  For the special but important case of EEE where only outlier deletions are allowed, we improve the parameter dependence of the FPT algorithm and obtain a running time of $\min\{(d+3)^k, 2^{d+k}\} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. Additionally, we provide an FPT-approximation algorithm for this problem, which outputs a set of at most $2 \cdot {\rm OPT}$ outliers in time $2^d \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. This 2-approximation algorithm improves upon the previous $(3+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm by Sidiropoulos, Wang, and Wang [SODA '17]. Furthermore, we complement our algorithms with hardness results motivating our choice of parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Approximating Klee's Measure Problem and a Lower Bound for Union Volume Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Union volume estimation is a classical algorithmic problem. Given a family of objects $O_1,\ldots,O_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, we want to approximate the volume of their union. In the special case where all objects are boxes (also known as hyperrectangles) this is known as Klee's measure problem. The state-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation and Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a total of $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of $O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query whether a given point is contained in $O_i$.
  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned three queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed optimal, i.e., $\Omega(n/\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Our lower bound already holds for estimating the union of equiponderous axis-aligned polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and even if the algorithm is allowed to inspect the coordinates of the points sampled from the polygons, and still holds when a containment query can ask containment of an arbitrary (not sampled) point.
  Guided by the insights of the lower bound, we provide a more efficient approximation algorithm for Klee's measure problem improving the $O(n/\varepsilon^2)$ time to $O((n+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}) \cdot \log^{O(d)}n)$. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the geometry of Klee's measure problem in various ways: (1) Since we have access to the boxes' coordinates, we can split the boxes into classes of boxes of similar shape. (2) Within each class, we show how to sample from the union of all boxes, by using orthogonal range searching. And (3) we exploit that boxes of different classes have small intersection, for most pairs of classes.</description>

      <title>Complexity of chess domination problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study different domination problems of attacking and non-attacking rooks and queens on polyominoes and polycubes of all dimensions. Our main result proves that maximum independent domination is NP-complete for non-attacking queens and for non-attacking rooks on polycubes of dimension three and higher. We also analyze these problems for polyominoes and convex polyominoes, conjecture the complexity classes, and provide a computer tool for investigation. We have also computed new values for classical queen domination problems on chessboards (square polyominoes). For our computations, we have translated the problem into an integer linear programming instance. Finally, using this computational implementation and the game engine Godot, we have developed a video game of minimum domination of queens and rooks on randomly generated polyominoes.</description>

      <title>A Subquadratic Time Approximation Algorithm for Individually Fair k-Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $k$-center problem in the context of individual fairness. Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between $x \in P$ and its $\lceil n/k \rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to optimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point $x$, there is a center within distance $r_x$. We give bicriteria $(\beta,\gamma)$-approximation algorithms that compute clusterings such that every point $x \in P$ has a center within distance $\beta r_x$ and the clustering cost is at most $\gamma$ times the optimal cost. Our main contributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \log n)$ time $(2,2)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized $O(nk\log(n/\delta)+k^2/\varepsilon)$ time $(10,2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, where $\delta$ denotes the failure probability. For the latter, we develop a randomized sampling procedure to compute constant factor approximations for the values $r_x$ for all $x\in P$ in subquadratic time; we believe this procedure to be of independent interest within the context of individual fairness.</description>
