      <title>Microscopic parameters of a type-II superconductor measured by small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A necessary condition for understanding and predicting the properties of any material is knowledge of microscopic parameters which control these properties. In superconductors these parameters are the radius of the orbital motion of electrons bound in Cooper pairs $R_0$ and the radius of the field-induced currents $r_i$ caused by precession of the pairs; one more parameter, associated with $r_i$, is the number density of Cooper pairs $n_{cp}$. In this communication we report on the first measurements of these parameters in a type-II superconductor (niobium) by SANS (small-angle neutron scattering). Other approaches potentially applicable for measuring the microscopic parameters are considered.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Berry phase in chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topology of the order parameter in the intermediate phase between the superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking transitions of a $p_x+ip_y$ superconductor under strain. The application of in-plane strain reduces the underlying crystal symmetry and lifts the degeneracy of the critical temperature between the $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals, resulting in a Dirac cone structure in the thermodynamic phase diagram. When the strain is varied adiabatically along a closed path enclosing the Dirac cone, the order parameter acquires a Berry phase of $\pi$, which originates from a half rotation of the superconducting gap function. This half rotation leaves a topological signature in the superfluid stiffness tensor, making it directly observable through the geometry of vortices and the upper critical field.</description>

      <title>Giant Domain Walls and Intrinsic Heterogeneity in 214 Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate interplay of structural, charge and spin orders in layered cuprates leads to emergent phenomena, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. However, there is growing awareness that both the structure and electronic ordering that underpin them are not fully homogeneous. Here, we employ scanning three-dimensional X-ray diffraction to spatially resolve structural distortions in La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$, a prototypical system that exhibits a strong competition between superconductivity and charge density wave order, across its low-temperature orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition. We uncover two forms of intrinsic microstructural heterogeneity: at 300 K, we reveal remarkably wide tetragonal-like domain wall regions within the nominally orthorhombic crystal structure, and, upon cooling to 100 K, a fine microstructure of orthorhombic-like stripes embedded within the tetragonal matrix emerges. This spatially resolved view directly defines the microstructural architecture of phase coexistence in this system, demonstrating how structural distortions generate intrinsic heterogeneity that shapes the balance between superconductivity and charge density wave order as constrained by the restrictive orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, offering a pathway to control correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Superconducting spintronics with electron symmetry filtering and interfacial spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Anomalous phase shift and superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions via thin films of rare-earth intermetallic magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S) Josephson junctions (JJs) with an anomalous ground state phase shift $\varphi_0 \neq 0,\pi$ ($\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs) enable the implementation of the zero-field Josephson diode effect with the possibility to control the diode efficiency and polarity. It is just as important that in this case $\varphi_0$ provides a coupling between the superconducting phase and the magnetization of the interlayer. Such $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs can be used for superconducting memory and logic circuit applications. Here we present the results of theoretical calculation of the current-phase relationship (CPR), exhibiting the Josephson diode effect and $\varphi_0\neq 0,\pi$, for a JJ through a specific magnetic material. As the interlayer of the JJ we consider an ultra-thin film of intermetallic lanthanide ($Ln$)-based compound $\mathrm{GdIr_2Si_2}$. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) methods and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we study the electronic structure and magnetic properties of the film, construct the effective tight-binding Hamiltonian, perfectly describing its electronic properties, and calculate CPR. The CPRs demonstrate a pronounced $\varphi_0$ of the order of unity and a pronounced Josephson diode effect with the diode efficiency $ \lesssim 0.3$. Moreover, the efficiency can be controlled via rotation of in-plane magnetization in the interlayer. The prospects for utilizing alternative magnetic $Ln$-based materials of the $LnT_2X_2$ family ($T$ is a transition metal and $X$ is a $p$-element from groups III-V) for the implementation in $\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Induced Superconductivity Enhancement under Large Exchange Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a comprehensive free energy analysis, we demonstrate that finite temperature can simultaneously weaken superconductivity and mitigate spin polarization induced depairing, leading to potential non-monotonic temperature-dependent behaviors in superconductors subjected to large exchange fields. Remarkably, superconductivity can be counterintuitively enhanced by temperature when the Zeeman energy exceeds the superconducting order parameter, owing to the competition between thermal and magnetic effects. We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model. A detailed parameter analysis identifies the conditions under which this phenomenon emerges, suggesting that temperature-enhanced superconductivity may be observable in materials such as MgB2 and FeSe through transport and tunneling measurements.</description>

      <title>Boost of critical current density near quantum critical points in FeSe-Based superconductors with two superconducting domes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified two superconducting domes in FeSe-based superconductors. It was discovered that each dome is accompanied by a distinct nematic quantum critical point (QCP): one associated with a pure nematic QCP, and the other with a nematic QCP entangled with antiferromagnetism (AFM). In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe. The mechanisms of vortex pinning and the influence of quantum critical fluctuations have been extensively explored, emphasizing the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations in modulating $J_{\rm{c}}$. Additionally, an increase in $J_{\rm{c}}$ was also noted near FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$, where its origin has been explored and discussed. This finding provides crucial clues about the existence of an ordered phase endpoint beneath the superconducting dome, offering an initial basis for further investigation into the potential presence of a QCP beneath it.</description>

      <title>Depairing critical current density and the vortex-free state in FeSe nanobridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depairing limit and the vortex-free state in a superconductor is crucial for both the study of supercurrent related physics and the application eliminating noise linked to vortex motion. In this work, we report the evidence of depairing limit and the vortex-free state achieved by geometric constraint in FeSe superconductors. A series of narrow bridges with varying widths at the same location of a single crystal were prepared by the \textquotedblleft pickup\textquotedblright method using successive focused ion beam millings. By simply reducing the width of bridge, the magnitude of critical current density ($J_{\rm{c}}$) is enhanced more than one order, evidence the achievement of depairing limit. Moreover, in the bridge with a width smaller than the penetration depth ($\lambda$), $J_{\rm{c}}$ is found to be robust against magnetic field up to 1 kOe. The field-robust $J_{\rm{c}}$ is a strong piece of evidence for vortex-free state, which is created by the enhancement of lower critical fields due to geometric constraint.</description>

      <title>Increase of critical current density in FeSe superconductor by strain effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional $J_c$-enhancement methods like doping and irradiation often introduce extrinsic elements or defects, altering intrinsic properties. Here, we report a significant $J_c$ enhancement in FeSe single crystals through compressive strain applied using a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic substrate with anisotropic thermal contraction during cooling. Under zero field at 2 K, $J_{\text{c}}$ increases by a factor of $\sim$4 from $\sim 2.3 \times 10^{4}$ to $\sim 8.7 \times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$; at 5 T, it achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement, rising from $\sim 1.0 \times 10^{3}$ to $\sim 1.0 \times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Analysis based on the Dew-Hughes model of the $f_{\text{p}}$(h) relationship shows that strain strengthens vortex pinning, and shifts the pinning mechanism from point-like pinning to combined point and surface pinnings. This work offers an effective method to enhance FeSe's current-carrying limitation, deepens understanding of iron-based superconductors' pinning mechanisms, and highlights strain engineering's potential for optimizing superconducting performance.</description>

      <title>Expansion of Momentum Space and Full 2$\pi$ Solid Angle Photoelectron Collection in Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy by Applying Sample Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) directly probes the energy and momentum of electrons in quantum materials, but conventional setups capture only a small fraction of the full 2$\pi$ solid angle. This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$\pi$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range.</description>

      <title>YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ nano-constriction Josephson junctions and SQUIDs fabricated by focused helium-ion-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By focused $30\,\mathrm{keV}$ He ion beam irradiation, epitaxially grown YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) thin films can be driven from the superconducting to the insulating state with increasing irradiation dose. A properly chosen dose suppresses superconductivity down to $4\,\mathrm{K}$, while crystallinity is still preserved. With this approach we create areas of normal-conducting YBCO that can be used to define resistively shunted constriction-type Josephson junctions (cJJs) on the nanometer scale. We also demonstrate that the fabricated cJJs can be incorporated in direct current superconducting quantum interference devices and can be used as detector junctions in THz antennas.</description>

      <title>Compact stationary fluxons in the Josephson junction ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stationary compact fluxon profiles are shown to be exact solutions of the inductively coupled and dc-biased Josephson junction ladder. Such states do not exist in the parallel Josephson junction array which is described by the standard discrete sine-Gordon equation. It is shown that there are compact fluxon and multi-fluxon states which either satisfy the top-bottom antisymmetry or are asymmetric. The anti-symmetric states have zero energy if their topological charge is even and the asymmetric states always have zero energy. Depending on the anisotropy constant the compact fluxons can either coexist with the non-compact states or only compact states are possible. External magnetic field prevents compact state existence.</description>

      <title>Appraising the absolute limits of nanotubes and nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter under high pressure often exhibits attractive properties, which, unfortunately, are typically irretrievable when released to ambient conditions. Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and {\gamma}-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and {\gamma}-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K. Similarly, in order to retrieve the metastable atomic hydrogen or molecular metallic hydrogen at about 250 GPa, it requires only three layers of a nanosphere to contain a volume size of 173 nm^3.</description>

Abstract: The pyrochlore lattice materials can exhibit geometrical frustration, while the related many-body electronic states remain elusive. In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2{\Delta}/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate spin fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. We argue that different superconducting states in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni $3d$ and O $2p$ states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ within the random phase approximation and find a transition between $d$-wave and sign-changing $s$-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity in flatband systems has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics. Alternating twisted multilayer graphene presents a compelling multiband system, with a coexistence of Dirac bands and flat bands, for exploring superconductivity. However, the roles of flat bands and dispersive bands played in determining the superconductivity remain elusive. Here, we focus on the alternating twisted quadralayer graphene to reveal unconventional superconducting behaviors by systematically quantifying individual contributions for both the dispersive bands and the flat bands. The superconductivity is robust, with a strong electrical field tunability, a maximum BKT transition temperature of 1.6 K, and high critical magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. By analyzing the Landau fan diagram at zero electric displacement fields, we disentangle Dirac bands and flat bands, revealing a Coulomb interaction-induced band broadening effect. We further quantify the electric-field-dependent evolution of the critical temperature and coherence length, and estimate the flat-band Fermi velocity and superfluid stiffness via critical current measurements. Our results demonstrate an electric field tunable coupling strength within the superconducting phase, revealing unconventional properties with vanishing Fermi velocity and large superfluid stiffness. These phenomena, attributed to substantial quantum metric contributions mediated by Dirac band hybridization, offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying unconventional flatband superconductivity in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity, Fluctuations, and Gap Filling in Overdoped Cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$, and the gap is found to fill instead of close with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a $d$-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. The Cooper pair momentum is directly controlled by an externally injected supercurrent providing an experimentally accessible tuning parameter for driving and manipulating the topological FF phase. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same topological FF phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding $45\%$ without applied magnetic fields. The $d$-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free architecture. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional superconducting diode effect in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Enhanced Graphene Superconductivity with Record Pauli-Limit Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</description>

      <title>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</description>
