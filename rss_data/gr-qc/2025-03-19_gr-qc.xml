      <title>Can Rotation Solve the Hubble Puzzle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancy between low and high redshift Hubble constant $H_0$ measurements is the highest significance tension within the concordance $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. If not due to unknown systematics, the Hubble puzzle suggests a lack of understanding of the universe's expansion history despite the otherwise spectacular success of the theory. We show that a G\"odel inspired slowly rotating dark-fluid variant of the concordance model resolves this tension with an angular velocity today $\omega_0 \simeq 2\times 10^{-3}$~Gyr\textsuperscript{-1}. Curiously, this is close to the maximal rotation, avoiding closed time-like loops with a tangential velocity less than the speed of light at the horizon.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Between Dark Matter-Black Hole Systems and Naked Singularities via Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) are an important phenomenon commonly observed in the X-ray radiation of black holes and neutron stars, closely related to the dynamics of accretion disks around compact objects and general relativistic effects. The objective of this study is to use the QPO phenomenon to distinguish between dark matter-black hole systems and naked singularities, as well as to investigate the effects of different dark matter models (Cold Dark Matter, CDM, and Scalar Field Dark Matter, SFDM) on the accretion disk dynamics. By introducing a dark matter correction model within the framework of general relativity, we systematically investigate the differences in dragging effects, characteristic frequency distribution, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius between dark matter-black hole systems and naked singularities, while analyzing the potential coupling between QPO frequencies and dark matter distribution. The main results of this study are as follows: $\nu_r$ and $\nu_\theta$ in dark matter-black hole systems can be identified as HFQPOs, while for lower spins ($a &lt; 0.5$), $\nu_\text{nod}$ can be identified as LFQPOs, and for higher spins ($1 &gt; a \geq 0.5$), $\nu_\text{nod}$ falls within the HFQPO observation range. Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM) modulate the accretion disk dynamics at the order of $10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on violation of Lorentz symmetry with clock-comparison redshift experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz symmetry is a cornerstone of both the General relativity and Standard Model and its experimental verification deepens our understanding of nature. This paper focuses on the investigation of Lorentz violations with the context of clock comparison experiments in the framework of Standard Model Extension (SME). Considering matter-gravity coupling sector, we provide a generic frame to study the sensitivities of Lorentz-violating coefficients for three distinct types of clock redshift tests, including the traditional gravitational redshift test, null-redshift test I and null-redshift test II. Each of these tests is sensitivity to different combinations of Lorentz-violating coefficients. By using the current clock comparison results, we estimate the limits of SME coefficients at level of parts in $10^{4}$ down to parts in $10^{7}$. Better sensitivity may be achieved in the clock comparisons by using the state-of-the-art optical clocks. Additionally considering relativistic factors in null-redshift I, the frequency comparison result of E2 and E3 transitions of Yb$^{+}$ can set the limit $c^{e}_{00}=(7.4\pm9.3)\times10^{-9}$ in the electron sector. Our analysis demonstrates that clock-comparison redshift experiments may contribute to explore the vast parameters space on searching for the Lorentz violation.</description>

The approach integrates stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) polarization data from LISA with CMB-S4 B-mode anisotropies, utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian inference, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimations to determine detection feasibility.</description>

      <title>The unification of gravity and the spin-1 field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unifying the massive spin-1 field with gravity requires the implementation of a regular vector field that satisfies the spin-1 Proca equation and is a fundamental part of the spacetime metric. That vector field is one of the pair of vectors in the line element field (\textbf{X},-\textbf{X}), which is paramount to the existence of all Lorentzian metrics and Modified General Relativity (MGR). Symmetrization of the spin-1 Klein-Gordon equation in a curved Lorentzian spacetime introduces the Lie derivative of the metric along the flow of one of the regular vectors in the line element field. The Proca equation in curved spacetime can then be described geometrically in terms of the line element vector, the Lie derivative of the Lorentzian metric, and the Ricci tensor, which unifies gravity and the spin-1 field. Related issues concerning charge conservation and the Lorenz constraint, singularities in a spherically symmetric curved spacetime, and geometrical implications of MGR to quantum theory are discussed. A geometrical unification of gravity with quantum field theory is presented.</description>

      <title>Regularizing the induced GW spectrum with dissipative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite mean free paths of light particles, like photons and neutrinos, lead to dissipative effects and damping of small-scale density fluctuations in the early universe. We study the impact of damping on the spectral density of gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations in the radiation-dominated universe. We show that the most important effects of damping are $(i)$ regularization of the resonant frequency and $(ii)$ a far low-frequency tail with no logarithmic running. The exact location of the break frequency below which the logarithmic running is lost depends on the damping rate. Both effects stem from the effective finite lifetime of the gravitational wave source caused by damping. Interestingly, we find that, for the standard model of particles, the effects of damping are most relevant at around or below the nHz frequencies. Our results showcase the importance of including the damping of primordial fluctuations in future analysis of induced gravitational waves. We provide detailed analytical formulas and approximations for the kernel of induced gravitational waves. Lastly, we discuss possible implications of damping in alleviating the gauge issue of induced gravitational waves and in suppressing the so-called poltergeist mechanism.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of a external weak asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electrical charge as well as the properties of the test particle such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of external and internal parameters of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Probing single-field inflation: predictions, constraints, and theoretical viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a single-field inflationary model, a specific class of the K-essence models where a coupling term exists between canonical Lagrangian and the potential. This coupling term has many effects on key inflationary parameters consisting of the power spectral, the spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the Hubble parameter, the equation of state parameter, and the slow-roll parameter. By solving the equations numerically and deriving analytical results, how this modification affects inflationary dynamics can be analyzed. Our results show that the coupling term, $\alpha$, decreases the inflationary parameters, such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and improves the consistency with observational constraints from Planck and BICEP/Keck at the $68 \%$ and $95 \%$ confidence. These findings indicate that the studied model provides a promising alternative to the early universe dynamics while aligning with recent cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Emerging black hole shadow from collapsing boson star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work devotes to investigate the dynamical emergence of black hole shadow from gravitational lensing in dynamical spacetime by using the collapsing boson star. Two characterized scenarios are adopted with or without considering the time delay of light propagation. As the boson star evolves, new Einstein rings emerge from the lensing center, with their radius gradually increasing, and their number continues to grow infinitely before the light-ring forms. The shadow forms instantaneously at the moment the black hole appears when ignoring the time delay of light propagation. Considering the time delay for light propagation in dynamical spacetime, a more intricate process of the shadow formation is uncovered: it first appears as a minute dot in the lensing center, then gradually grows as the black hole grows, eventually expands the inner region of the light-ring. During the quasi-stable phases of boson star and black hole, the lensing and shadow structures from two scenarios are nearly identical and remain almost unchanged. Our results present the universal dynamic patterns of the lensing and shadow structures, and reveal the potential observed phenomena near the collapsing star and the event horizon of the newly formed black hole.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave Extraction using Independent Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method to extract a set of time-series data using "statistical independency" of each component. We propose applying ICA for extracting gravitational wave (GW) signals. Our idea is to extract a signal that is commonly included in multiple detectors and to find it by shifting the data-set around its arrival time. In this article, we show several tests using injected signals, and show that this method can be applied to events for signal-to-noise over 15. We then demonstrate the method to actual O1-O3 events, and the identification of the arrival time can be estimated more precisely than that was previously reported. This approach does not require templates of waveform, therefore it can be applied for testing general relativity, and also for finding unknown GW.</description>

      <title>Stable Wormholes in Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of Lorentzian traversable wormholes in conformal gravity, constructed via Weyl rescaling of Minkowski spacetime. As a result, these wormholes are solutions of every theory of gravity that is both conformally invariant and admits Minkowski spacetime as a solution. We specifically examine the case of a wormhole possessing a Morris-Thorne shape function, arising as a solution of a scalar-tensor conformally invariant theory of gravity. We show that these solutions represent regular, traversable wormholes that are also stable at the linear perturbation level. We argue that, when the Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken, the broken symmetry phase may lead to a stable ``wormhole phase" alternative to the flat ``Minkowski phase".</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the static radial coordinate-dependent spherically symmetric spacetime in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity for a scalar field source. We begin by setting the static field equations (FEs) to be solved and solve the conservation laws for scalar field potential solutions. We simplify the FEs and then find a general formula for computing the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions applicable for any scalar field potential $V(T)$ and coframe ansatz. We compute new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions by using a power-law coframe ansatz for each scalar potential case arising from the conservation laws. We apply this formula to find new exact teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for several cases of coframe ansatz parameter. The new $F(T)$ solution classes will be relevant for {studying the models close to Born--Infeld and/or scalarized Black Hole (BH) solutions inside the} dark energy (DE) described by a fundamental scalar field such as quintessence, phantom energy or quintom system, to name only those types.</description>

      <title>Microstates of Non-extremal Black Holes: A New Hope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new roadmap for constructing microstates of non-extremal black holes in supergravity. First, we review the non-linear sigma model of five-dimensional supergravity governing stationary solutions with a U(1) isometry and present the first generalized Ernst formulation of this model. We then revisit solution-generating techniques associated to the coset model symmetry, Ernst formalism and inverse scattering method. While some of these techniques have been extensively used to generate non-extremal black holes and black rings in supergravity, we demonstrate how they can be adapted to construct systematically non-BPS smooth horizonless geometries that have the same mass and charges as non-extremal black holes. To illustrate these methods, we construct novel static solutions of this type, including a non-BPS generalization of the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Gibbons-Hawking center, which has served as the fundamental building block of multicenter microstates of BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering via the Born Series: Scalar Tidal Matching to $\mathcal{O}(G^7)$ and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to compute gravitational wave amplitudes within the framework of effective field theory. By reinterpreting the Feynman diagram expansion as a Born series, our method offers several key advantages. It directly yields partial wave amplitudes, streamlining the matching with black hole perturbation theory. Long-distance gravitational interactions are unambiguously factorized from short-distance tidal effects, including dissipation, which are systematically incorporated via an in-in worldline effective action. Crucially, at every order in perturbation theory, integrals are expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms, enabling an end-to-end computation scalable to arbitrary orders. We illustrate the method with new predictions for scalar black hole Love numbers and their Renormalization Group equations to $\mathcal{O}(G^7)$.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. We also show how the expressions for the amplitubes can naturally be understood as a sum over orientations of the underlying graph. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph and demonstrate how the set of all decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>

      <title>On the Explicit Asymptotic Symmetry Breaking of sl(3,R) Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic symmetry algebras (ASA) of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the framework of sl(3,R) symmetry. By explicitly constructing this algebra,
  we explore how the presence of the dilaton field influences the structure of asymptotic symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms at the AdS(2) boundary. For the sl(3,R) model, the
  dilaton field preserves a subset of the complete W(3)-symmetry, restricting the algebra to sl(3,R). These results provide deeper insights into the role of dilaton dynamics
  in holographic dualities, with implications for the thermodynamics and geometry of AdS(2). The findings pave the way for systematically exploring extended gauge symmetries in
  two-dimensional gravity and their relevance to higher-rank Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Rotating AdS Black Holes with Quantum Hair in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we study semiclassical stationary rotating AdS black holes with non-trivial quantum hair in three and five dimensions. We construct these solutions by perturbing the BTZ black hole and the five-dimensional Myers-Perry AdS black hole according to holographic semiclassical equations. In the three-dimensional case, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges as $\sim 1/\lambda^n~(n=1,2)$ along a radial null geodesic as the affine parameter $\lambda$ approaches zero at the Cauchy horizon, depending on the type of perturbation. In the five-dimensional case, most hairy solutions exhibit strong divergences, either in the stress-energy tensor or in the parallelly propagated Riemann components, along the radial null geodesic crossing the Cauchy horizon. Nevertheless, there exists a specific class of semiclassical solutions that retain a $C^0$-regular Cauchy horizon, where perturbations remain bounded. For extremal black holes, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges along a radial null geodesic transverse to the event horizon in both three and five dimensions, even though all components of the perturbed metric vanish in this limit.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators due to their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light-curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles in measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimates, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represent a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machines in BTZ black hole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Constraints on Extended Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use new cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) to test foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model and set constraints on extensions to it. We derive constraints from the ACT DR6 power spectra alone, as well as in combination with legacy data from Planck. To break geometric degeneracies, we include ACT and Planck CMB lensing data and baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI Year-1, and further add supernovae measurements from Pantheon+ for models that affect the late-time expansion history. We verify the near-scale-invariance (running of the spectral index $d n_s/d\ln k = 0.0062 \pm 0.0052$) and adiabaticity of the primordial perturbations. Neutrino properties are consistent with Standard Model predictions: we find no evidence for new light, relativistic species that are free-streaming ($N_{\rm eff} = 2.86 \pm 0.13$, which combined with external BBN data becomes $N_{\rm eff} = 2.89 \pm 0.11$), for non-zero neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.082$ eV at 95% CL), or for neutrino self-interactions. We also find no evidence for self-interacting dark radiation ($N_{\rm idr} &lt; 0.134$), early-universe variation of fundamental constants, early dark energy, primordial magnetic fields, or modified recombination. Our data are consistent with standard BBN, the FIRAS-inferred CMB temperature, a dark matter component that is collisionless and with only a small fraction allowed as axion-like particles, a cosmological constant, and the late-time growth rate predicted by general relativity. We find no statistically significant preference for a departure from the baseline $\Lambda$CDM model. In general, models introduced to increase the Hubble constant or to decrease the amplitude of density fluctuations inferred from the primary CMB are not favored by our data.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration released the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec.=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been a speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without fixed LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

      <title>Toward a computationally-efficient follow-up pipeline for blind continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave (CW) searches for unknown neutron stars (NSs) is limited by their parameter space breadth. To fit within reasonable computing budgets, hierarchical schemes are used to identify interesting candidates using affordable methods. The resulting sensitivity depends on the number of candidates selected to follow-up. In this work, we present a novel framework to evaluate the effectiveness of stochastic CW follow-ups. Our results allow for a significant reduction of the computing cost of pyfstat, a well-established follow-up method. We also simplify the setup of multistage follow-ups by removing the need for parameter-space metrics. The study was conducted on Gaussian and real O3 Advanced LIGO data covering both isolated and binary sources. These results will have a positive impact on the sensitivity of all-sky searches in the forthcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Black Bounce to Transversable Wormhole Analytically Connected to an asymptotically $AdS_5$ Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recent approach from reference [1] to obtain complete and analytic solutions (both brane and bulk) of a Simpson-Visser (SV) geometry within a braneworld framework. The embedded geometry can represent a traversable wormhole (TWH), a one-way wormhole (OOWH), or a regular black hole (RBH). The resulting geometry is regular everywhere, eliminating any singularity or local de-Sitter core at the origin and on the brane location, where the regular geometry is given by the SV geometry. The throat of TWHs or OOWHs can extend into the extra dimension. The event horizon of RBH extends along the extra dimension, prompting speculation on the extension of entropy into this dimension. Although the induced geometry is characterized by tension, acting akin to a positive cosmological constant (thus potentially representing empty space), the induced four-dimensional geometry remains regular. There is no need to introduce additional energy sources on the brane to achieve this regularity. Hence, the brane's geometry, which may depict an RBH, TWH, or OWWH, is influenced by the geometric properties of the bulk</description>

      <title>Interacting Holographic dark energy with matter creation: A dynamical system analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interacting Holographic dark energy (HDE) with different infra-red (IR) cutoffs (Hubble horizon and future event horizon) is investigated in the background dynamics of flat Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) universe where gravitational particle creation effects via different form of particle creation rates (1) $\Gamma=3\beta H$ and (2) $\Gamma=3\alpha H_{0}+3\beta H$ are considered. The created particles are considered to be pressureless Dark Matter (DM) which interacts with the HDE through a phenomenological choice of interaction term $Q=3\gamma H \rho_{m}$. We obtain an analytic solution of the cosmological dynamics with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff when the creation rate is taken as $\Gamma=3 \beta H$. We find that the interacting HDE from the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff can give the late-time acceleration and non-interacting cannot give. On the other hand, employing the Hubble horizon and the future event as IR cutoffs for the model of HDE does not provide the analytic solution when the creation rate is taken as $\Gamma=3\alpha H_{0}+3\beta H$. We then analyze the model separately using the dynamical systems theory. From the analysis, the model (with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff) provides two sets of critical points. One can give a late-time accelerated universe evolving in quintessence, the cosmological constant, or the phantom era. But, it does not show any matter-dominated era. On the other hand, by applying the future event as an IR cutoff, the model provides the complete evolution of the universe. It also exhibits the late-time scaling attractor gives the possible solution of the coincidence problem. Global dynamics of the model are investigated by defining the appropriate Lyapunov function. Finally, the adiabatic sound speeds of all the models have been calculated and plotted numerically to find the stability of the models.</description>

      <title>Evolution of fluctuations in energy at the horizon and in the volume enclosed by it, in an expanding universe</title>

Abstract: This study examines the statistical fluctuations in energy on the Hubble horizon and the Komar energy, which represents the total gravitational energy within the horizon, as the universe expands. Our analysis reveals that these fluctuations generally decrease over time but experience a pronounced spike during the universe's transition into its later accelerated expansion phase. In the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the evolution of these fluctuations shows similar behaviour, eventually stabilising at a constant minimum value. We also find that these fluctuations are holographically connected, provided the universe ends in a de Sitter phase. This holographic connection suggests that in the final de Sitter epoch, the relative fluctuations of the horizon energy and the Komar energy are equivalent, and satisfies, $\sigma_H^2/\left&lt;E_H\right&gt;^2=1/N_{surf}=1/N_{bulk} = \sigma_V^2/\left&lt;E_V\right&gt;^2.$</description>

Abstract: Using the Functional Renormalization Group approach we construct effective quantum spacetime geometries by self-consistently deforming the classical Schwarzschild-de Sitter black-hole solution. This involves studying how quantum corrections, driven by the running of the Newton's and cosmological constants modify the solution across the infrared and ultraviolet regimes. We show that these quantum modifications replace the Schwarzschild singularity with a milder conical one. Moreover, two new features emerge in the ultraviolet regime. First, we identify a phase transition between Anti-de Sitter/de Sitter spacetime occurring when the object's mass exceeds a first critical threshold. Second, we predict the formation of horizons once the object's mass exceeds a second threshold. Both thresholds are of the order of the Planck mass. Finally, we investigate the role of the anomalous dimension in the conformal sector of the theory.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the role of pressure anisotropy and dissipation is crucial for modelling compact objects' internal structure and observable properties. In this work, we reinterpret local pressure anisotropy in relativistic stellar structures as an additional contribution to the energy density. This perspective enables the formulation of anisotropic equations of state for self-gravitating systems by incorporating anisotropy as a fundamental component. We demonstrate that this approach yields more realistic stellar models that satisfy key physical constraints, including mass-radius relationships and stability conditions. Our results are compared with observational data, particularly the inferred compactness of pulsars PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, showing that both anisotropic and isotropic models can describe these objects. Additionally, we examine the influence of dissipation -- such as temperature gradients -- on radial pressure, demonstrating that it can be modelled similarly to anisotropy. This interpretation allows the transformation of dissipative anisotropic models into equivalent non-dissipative isotropic configurations.</description>

      <title>Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mimetic type extension of the Weyl geometric gravity theory, by assuming that the metric of the space-time manifold can be parameterized in terms of a scalar field, called the mimetic field. The action of the model is obtained by starting from a conformally invariant gravitational action, constructed, in Weyl geometry, from the square of the Weyl scalar, the strength of the Weyl vector, and an effective matter term, respectively. after linearizing the action in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, we include the mimetic field, constructed from the same auxiliary scalar field used to linearize the action, via a Lagrange multiplier. The conformal invariance of the action is maintained by imposing the trace condition on the effective matter energy-momentum tensor, built up from the ordinary matter Lagrangian, and some specific functions of the Weyl vector, and the scalar field, respectively, thus making the matter sector of the action conformally invariant. We investigate the cosmological implications of the Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity by considering the dynamics of an isotropic and homogeneous FRW Universe. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are derived, and their solutions are obtained numerically for a dust filled Universe. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered model with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, and with the results of the $\Lambda$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the present model give a good description of the observational data, and they reproduce almost exactly the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Hence, Mimetic Weyl geometric gravity can be considered a viable alternative to the standard approaches to cosmology, and to the gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Bound Orbits and Gravitational Wave Radiation Around the Hairy Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hairy black hole model provides a new theoretical framework for exploring phenomena in strong gravitational fields. This paper systematically investigates the influence of the hair parameter $\beta$ on the timelike geodesics of the regular hairy black hole, including the radius of the event horizon, the properties of bound orbits, and the characteristics of gravitational wave radiation over a single period. The study reveals that $\beta$ has a significant impact on the event horizon but only a minor effect on the innermost stable circular orbit(ISCO), the marginally bound orbit(MBO), and periodic orbits. Moreover, the trajectories of the periodic orbits are nearly identical to those of the Schwarzschild black hole. In addition, the parameter $\beta$ was constrained by simulating the precession observational data of the S2 star orbiting the supermassive black hole Sgr A*. The results indicate that the correction effects of $\beta$ comply with existing observational constraints, without providing stricter limitations. Furthermore, by considering periodic orbits as transitional orbits in the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, it is found that the presence of $\beta$ introduces subtle effects on the amplitude, phase, and period of the gravitational wave signal for a single orbit. Although these effects appear minor within a single cycle, they may accumulate into significant effects over long-term evolution. In the future, space-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to further investigate the properties of the hair parameter, enhancing our understanding of the spacetime structure and dynamical behavior of black holes.</description>

      <title>Impact of the relativistic Cowling approximation on shear and interface modes of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate shear and interface modes excited in neutron stars with an elastic crust in the full general relativistic framework and compare them to the results obtained within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We observe that the Cowling approximation has virtually no impact on the frequencies or the eigenfunctions of the shear modes; in contrast, the interface modes that arise due to the discontinuities of the shear modulus experience a considerable shift in frequency when applying the Cowling approximation . Furthermore, we extend a scheme based on the properties of the phase of amplitude ratios, which allows us to estimate the damping times of slowly damped modes; our extension can provide an estimation of the damping time even if the features of the amplitude ratio are incomplete or if some of them violate the underlying linearity assumption. The proposed scheme is also computationally less expensive and numerically more robust and we provide accurate estimates as well as lower bounds for damping times of shear and interface modes. We estimate the damping times also via the quadrupole formula and find that it provides good order-of-magnitude estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity reduction of binary neutron star initial data with the entropy based flux limiting scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of high-resolution shock-capturing schemes is vital in producing highly accurate gravitational waveforms from neutron star binaries. The entropy based flux limiting (EFL) scheme is able to perform fast converging binary neutron star merger simulations reaching up to fourth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase. In these results the EFL method was used only in the dynamical evolution of initial data constructed with the Lorene library. Here, we extend the use of the EFL method to the construction of eccentricity reduced initial data for neutron star binaries and present several new BNS simulations resulting from such initial data and show for the first time up to optimal fifth-order convergence in the gravitational waveform phase.</description>

      <title>Sky localization of gravitational waves from eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbital eccentricity in compact binary mergers can be used to improve their sky localization using gravitational wave observations. Existing algorithms that conduct the localizations are not optimized for eccentric sources. We use a semi-Bayesian technique to carry out localizations of simulated sources recovered using a matched-filter search. Through these simulations, we find that if a non-negligible eccentricity is obtained during the detection, an eccentricity-optimized algorithm can significantly improve the localization areas compared to the existing methods. We also lay out the foundation for an eccentric early-warning system using the matched-filter search. The potential impact on the early-warning localization is investigated. We indicate a few possible cases of improvements while accounting for eccentricity toward any detectable eccentric neutron star binaries in the forthcoming observing scenarios of ground-based detectors. Improved localizations can be useful in effectually utilizing the capabilities of the follow-up facilities.</description>

      <title>Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its application for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, the criticality, the heat capacity, the zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

Abstract: We express the $q$-th Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass of an immersed submanifold of Euclidean space as a linear combination of two terms: the total $(2q)$-th mean curvature and the integral, over the entire manifold, of the inner product between the $(2q+1)$-th mean curvature vector and the position vector of the immersion. As a consequence, we obtain, for each $q$, a geometric inequality that holds whenever the positive mass theorem (for the $q$-th Gauss-Bonnet-Chern mass) holds.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature. Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embeddings of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Constructing noncommutative black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>
