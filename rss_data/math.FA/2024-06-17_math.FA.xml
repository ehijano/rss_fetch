      <title>Wiener-Hopf indices of unimodular functions on the imaginary axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the Wiener-Hopf indices of unimodular rational matrix functions on the imaginary axis. These indices play a role in the Fredholm theory for Wiener-Hopf integral operators. Our main result gives formulas for the Wiener-Hopf indices in terms of the matrices appearing in realizations of the factors in a Douglas-Shapiro-Shields factorization of the unimodular function. Two approaches to this problem are presented: one direct approach using operator theoretic methods, and a second approach using the Cayley transform which allows to use results for an analogous problem regarding unimodular functions on the unit circle and corresponding Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Compactness in Lorentz sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are going to discuss compactness in Lorentz sequence spaces. Firstly, it will be shown how to define such a space, check whether a sequence belongs to it and calculate its norm. Equipped with this knowledge, we will proceed to propose usable compactness criteria for Lorentz sequence spaces, employing the concept of seminorms.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Dunford--Pettis sets and V$^*$-sets in Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we show that one cannot differentiate between reciprocal Dunford--Pettis sets and V$^*$-sets in a Banach lattice. That is, for a bounded subset $K$ of a Banach lattice $E$, $K$ is a V$^*$-set if and only if $K$ is a reciprocal Dunford--Pettis set, or equivalently, if and only if every disjoint sequence in the solid hull of $K$ is weakly null (i.e. $K$ is disjointly weakly compact).</description>

      <title>Uniformly continuous semigroups of sublinear transition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work I investigate uniformly continuous semigroups of sublinear transition operators on the Banach space of bounded real-valued functions on some countable set. I show how the family of exponentials of a bounded sublinear rate operator is such a semigroup, and how any such semigroup must be a family of exponentials generated by a bounded sublinear rate operator.</description>

      <title>Anomalies for conformal nets associated with lattices and $T$-kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ an even lattice and $T_{L}=\mathbb{R}^{n}/L$ the associated torus. Associated with $L$ we construct $T_{L}$--kernel on a hyperfinite factor type $\mathcal{A}_{L}$, i.e. a monomorphism $T_{L}\to\mathsf{Out}(\mathcal{A}_{L})$, and compute Sutherland's obstruction class in $H^{3}_{\mathrm{Borel}}(T_{L},\mathbb{T})\cong H^{4}(BT_{L} ,\mathbb{Z})$, which is an invariant of the $T_{L}$--kernel and an obstruction to the existence of a twisted crossed product by $T_{L}$. As a Corollary, we obtain that for any $n$-torus $T$ any class in $H^{3}_{\mathrm{Borel}}(T,\mathbb{T})$ arises as an obstruction for a $T$-kernel on the hyperfinite type III${}_{1}$ factor $R$. The construction is an analogue of the construction of Vaughan Jones for finite groups on the hyperfinite type II${}_{1}$ factor but is also motivated by and has applications to conformal nets. Namely, there is an associated local extension $\mathcal{A}_{L}\supseteq \mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ of conformal nets and the $T_{L}$--kernel corresponds to a family of $T_{L^\ast}$--twisted sectors representations whose anomaly (obstruction) can be identified with the inner product on $L$ seen as a class in $H^{4}(BT_{L},\mathbb{Z})\cong \operatorname{Sym}^{2}(L,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of multi-faced independences: a combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine a set of necessary conditions on a partition-indexed family of complex numbers to be the "highest coefficients" of a positive and symmetric multi-faced universal product; i.e. the product associated with a multi-faced version of noncommutative stochastic independence, such as bifreeness. The highest coefficients of a universal product are the weights of the moment-cumulant relation for its associated independence. We show that these conditions are almost sufficient, in the sense that whenever the conditions are satisfied, one can associate a (automatically unique) symmetric universal product with the prescribed highest coefficients. Furthermore, we give a quite explicit description of such families of coefficients, thereby producing a list of candidates that must contain all positive symmetric universal products. We discover in this way four (three up to trivial face-swapping) previously unknown moment-cumulant relations that give rise to symmetric universal products; to decide whether they are positive, and thus give rise to independences which can be used in an operator algebraic framework, remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Widths and rigidity of unconditional sets and random vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any unconditional set in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that is invariant under cyclic shifts of coordinates is rigid in $\ell_q^N$, $1\le q\le 2$, i.e. it can not be well approximated by linear spaces of dimension essentially smaller than $N$. We apply the approach of E.D.~Gluskin to the setting of averaged Kolmogorov widths of unconditional random vectors or vectors of independent mean zero random variables, and prove their rigidity. These results are obtained using a general lower bound for the averaged Kolmogorov width via weak moments of biorthogonal random vector. This paper continues the study of the rigidity initiated by the first author.
  We also provide several corollaries including lower bounds for Kolmogorov widths of mixed norm balls.</description>

      <title>On Sequences with at Most a Finite Number of Zero Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the existence of algebraic and topological structures in the set of sequences that contain only a finite number of zero coordinates. Inspired by the work of Daniel Cariello and Juan B. Seoane-Sep\'ulveda, our research reveals new insights and complements their notable results beyond the classical \( \ell_p \) spaces for \( p \) in the interval from 1 to infinity, including the intriguing case where \( p \) is between 0 and 1.
  Our exploration employs notions such as S-lineability, pointwise lineability, and (alpha, beta)-spaceability. This investigation allowed us to verify, for instance, that the set \( F \setminus Z(F) \), where \( F \) is a closed subspace of \( \ell_p \) containing \( c_0 \), is (alpha, c)-spaceable if and only if alpha is finite.</description>

      <title>Beurling and Model subspaces invariant under a universal operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the Beurling and Model subspaces of the Hardy-Hilbert space $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ invariant under the composition operator $C_{\phi_a}f=f\circ\phi_a$, where $\phi_a(z) = az + 1 - a$ for $a \in (0,1)$ is an affine self-map of the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. These operators have universal translates (in the sense of Rota) and have attracted attention recently due to their connection with the Invariant Subspace Problem (ISP) and the classical Ces\`aro operator.</description>

      <title>Causal evolution of probability measures and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the notion of a causal time-evolution of a conserved nonlocal physical quantity in a globally hyperbolic spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. The role of the `global time' is played by a chosen Cauchy temporal function $\mathcal{T}$, whereas the instantaneous configurations of the nonlocal quantity are modeled by probability measures $\mu_t$ supported on the corresponding time slices $\mathcal{T}^{-1}(t)$. We show that the causality of such an evolution can be expressed in three equivalent ways: (i) via the causal precedence relation $\preceq$ extended to probability measures, (ii) with the help of a probability measure $\sigma$ on the space of future-directed continuous causal curves endowed with the compact-open topology and (iii) through a causal vector field $X$ of $L^\infty_{\textrm{loc}}$-regularity, with which the map $t \mapsto \mu_t$ satisfies the continuity equation in the distributional sense. In the course of the proof we find that the compact-open topology is sensitive to the differential properties of the causal curves, being equal to the topology induced from a suitable $H^1_{\textrm{loc}}$-Sobolev space. This enables us to construct $X$ as a vector field in a sense `tangent' to $\sigma$. In addition, we discuss the general covariance of descriptions (i)-(iii), unraveling the geometrical, observer-independent notions behind them.</description>
