      <title>Classes of functions in the set of circulant matrices and their characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce new classes of functions that extend the known classes of functions of complex variable, such as entire functions, meromorphic functions, rational functions and polynomial functions and take values in the set of circulant matrices with complex entries. For these new classes of functions, we extend the recently obtained characterization theorems in [Li, B. Q. Two elementary properties of entire functions and their applications. Amer. Math. Monthly 122(2) (2015), 169--172] and [Li, B. Q. A characterization of rational functions. Amer. Math. Monthly. 132(3) (2025), 269--271] to an algebraic structure of circulant matrices that includes several complex variables. Our characterization theorems lead to the generalization of the variant of the fundamental theorem of algebra established recently in [Abramov, V. M. Extension of the fundamental theorem of algebra for polynomial matrix equation with circulant matrices. Amer. Math. Monthly. DOI: 10.1080/00029890.2024.2440298].</description>

      <title>Study of Bounded Variation on the H-L Nontangential Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a proof of sharp boundedness of the discrete 1-dimensional Hardy-Littlewood nontangential maximal operator, when the parameter is in the range $[\frac{1}{3},+\infty)$. This generalizes a theorem by Bober, Carneiro, Hughes and Pierce, where they prove the same result for the uncentered version of the maximal operator. We also use analogous ideas to give an alternative proof for the continuous version of the theorem, by Ramos.</description>

      <title>Universal geometries underpinning linear second order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep relationship [arXiv:2503.17816v1] between real linear second order ordinary differential equations $u''\left(x\right)+h\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)=0$, with differentiable $h(x)$, and two dimensional hyperbolic geometry is generalized in a multitude of ways. First, I present an equivalent relationship in which the hyperbolic geometry is replaced by a two dimensional (anti-)de Sitter geometry. I show that this equation everywhere admits a pair of linearly independent solutions locally expressed in terms of an arbitrary non-vertical geodesic curve in this geometry. I also show that every solution of a corresponding Ricatti equation $ \Theta'\left(x\right)+\Theta^2\left(x\right)+h(x)=0$ obtained through $u'\left(x\right)=\Theta\left(x\right)u\left(x\right)$ itself is a geodesic curve in the two dimensional (anti-)de Sitter geometry.
  Next, after promoting $h(x)$ to a holomorphic function $h(z)$, I express two linearly independent solutions of $u''\left(z\right)+h\left(z\right)u\left(z\right)=0$ in virtually the same way as for the real scenario and hyperbolic geometry. In this case, the curves used to build the solutions are geodesic in a two dimensional complex Riemannian geometry of a sphere. Analogous results for the complex Ricatti equation follow. This geometric interpretation is independent of the function $h(z)$, while the holomorphic metric assumes the same functional form as the hyperbolic metric discovered in [arXiv:2503.17816v1].
  Finally, I show that the equation in question is in an equivalent relationship with four dimensional pseudo Riemannian K\"ahler-Norden geometry. The added value of working with real geometry turns out to be that certain two dimensional submanifold of the K\"ahler-Norden manifold render the hyperbolic and the (anti-)de Sitter scenario, both relevant for the real equation.</description>

      <title>Derivative polynomials and infinite series for squigonometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All squigonometric functions admit derivatives that can be expressed as polynomials of the squine and cosquine. We introduce a general framework that allows us to determine these polynomials recursively. We also provide an explicit formula for all coefficients of these polynomials. This also allows us to provide an explicit expression for the MacLaurin series coefficients of all squigonometric functions. We further discuss some methods that can compute the squigonometric functions up to any given tolerance over all of the real line.</description>

      <title>A Herglotz-Nevanlinna function from the optimal discrete $p$-Hardy weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently proved by Fischer, Keller, and Pogorzelski in [Integr. Equ. Oper. Theory, 95(24), 2023] that the classical discrete $p$-Hardy inequality admits an improvement, and the optimal $p$-Hardy weight $\omega_{p}$ was determined therein. We prove that $\omega_{p}$ directly corresponds to a Herglotz-Nevanlinna function, establish an integral representation for this function, and consequently confirm a slight modification of a conjecture on its absolute monotonicity from the aforementioned article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover an explicit construction of non-degenerate $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n},n\geq 3$, using a variant of ellipsoidal coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The branching set of these examples is a codimension-$2$ ellipsoid. Moreover, the graph of the related $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-harmonic one form in $T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$, can be obtained as a certain limit of a specific sequence of Lawlor's necks in $\mathbb{C}^{n}=T^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Extrapolation and Its Applications to Characterizing Parabolic BMO Spaces via Parabolic Fractional Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the parabolic version of the celebrated Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem. As applications, we obtain new characterizations of parabolic BMO-type spaces in terms of various commutators of parabolic fractional operators with time lag. The key tools to achieve these include to establish the appropriate form in the parabolic setting of the parabolic Rubio de Francia iteration algorithm, the Cauchy integral trick, and a modified Fourier series expansion argument adapted to the parabolic geometry. The novelty of these results lies in the fact that, for the first time, we not only introduce a new class of commutators associated with parabolic fractional integral operators with time lag, but also utilize them to provide a characterization of the parabolic BMO-type space in the high-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Roots of real-valued zero mean maps: Compositions of linear functionals and equivariant maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit the Carath\'eodory-type result that any point in the convex hull of a closed convex curve in $\mathbb R^{2d}$ is a convex combination of at most $d+1$ points along the curve and extremal results for gaps between zeros of trigonometric polynomials as Borsuk--Ulam-type results for $\mathbb Z/p$-equivariant maps from the circle. We develop a geometric-topological framework that gives structural results for the distribution of zeros of certain zero mean maps on the circle and the $n$-torus. Given an equivariant map $\gamma$ from a compact metric space $X$ to $\mathbb R^d$ and a set $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $X$, this framework provides general criteria that guarantee the existence of an $A \in \mathcal F$ such that all compositions of linear functionals with $\gamma$ have a zero on $A$. In particular, this seems to be a fruitful perspective to generalize results about common zeros of functions in a Chebyshev space. As a consequence we derive higher precision integration formulas and bounds for the largest geodesic ball in the $n$-torus where multivariate trigonometric polynomials may stay positive in terms of the size of their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of smooth solutions to the subcritical EPDiff equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the EPDiff equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the integer-order homogeneous Sobolev inertia operator $A=(-\Delta)^k$. We prove that for arbitrary radial initial data and a sign condition on the initial momentum, the corresponding radial velocity solution has $C^1$ norm that blows up in finite time whenever $0\le k&lt;n/2+1.$ Our approach is to use Lagrangian coordinates to formulate EPDiff as an ODE on a Banach space, enabling us to use a comparison estimate with the Liouville equation. Along the way we derive the Green function in terms of hypergeometric functions and discuss their properties. This is a step toward proving the general conjecture that the EPDiff equation is globally well-posed for any Sobolev inertia operator of any real order $k$ if and only if $k\ge n/2+1$.</description>

      <title>Realizing trees of hypergraphs in thin sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a continuous function, smooth away from the diagonal, such that, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, the associated generalized Radon transforms \begin{equation} \label{Radon} R_t^{\phi}f(x)=\int_{\phi(x,y)=t} f(y) \psi(y) d\sigma_{x,t}(y) \end{equation} map $L^2({\mathbb R}^d) \to H^{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^d)$ for all $t&gt;0$. Let $E$ be a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ for some $d \ge 2$, and suppose that the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $&gt;d-\alpha$. Then any tree graph $T$ on $k+1$ ($k \ge 1$) vertices is realizable in $E$, in the sense that there exist distinct $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1} \in E$ and $t&gt;0$ such that the $\phi$-distance $\phi(x^i, x^j)$ is equal to $t$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to the edges of the graph $T$.
  We also extend this notion to hyper-graphs where points $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1}$ are connected by a hyper-edge if $\phi(x^i,x^j)=t_{ij}$ for a set of pairs $(i,j)$ selected in accordance with a graph $H$, and $\{t_{ij}\}$ is a pre-assigned collection of positive distances. A chain of hyper-edges is a sequence $$\{(x^1_1, \dots, x^{k+1}_1), (x^1_2, \dots, x^{k+1}_2), \dots, (x^1_n,\dots, x^{k+1}_n)\},$$ where $(x^1_i, \dots, x^{k+1}_i)$ and $(x^1_{i+1}, \dots, x^{k+1}_{i+1})$, $1 \leq i \leq n$, share one and only one vertex $x^J_i$, with $J$ pre-assigned. A hyper-graph tree is defined analogously. The key estimate behind these arguments is a variant of (\ref{Radon}) where the average over the level set of $\phi(x,\cdot)$ is replaced by the average over an intersection of such surfaces. In the process, we develop a general graph theoretic paradigm that reduces a variety of point configuration questions to operator theoretic estimates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic neighborhood embedding and the gradient flow of relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction, widely used in science, maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space. We investigate a basic mathematical model underlying the techniques of stochastic neighborhood embedding (SNE) and its popular variant t-SNE. Distances between points in high dimensions are used to define a probability distribution on pairs of points, measuring how similar the points are. The aim is to map these points to low dimensions in an optimal way so that similar points are closer together. This is carried out by minimizing the relative entropy between two probability distributions.
  We consider the gradient flow of the relative entropy and analyze its long-time behavior. This is a self-contained mathematical problem about the behavior of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We find optimal bounds for the diameter of the evolving sets as time tends to infinity. In particular, the diameter may blow up for the t-SNE version, but remains bounded for SNE.</description>

      <title>Degenerate parabolic equations in divergence form: fundamental solution and Gaussian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider second order degenerate parabolic equations with complex, measurable, and time-dependent coefficients. The degenerate ellipticity is dictated by a spatial $A_2$-weight. We prove that having a generalized fundamental solution with upper Gaussian bounds is equivalent to Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates for local weak solutions. In the special case of real coefficients, Moser's $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimates are known, which provide an easier proof of Gaussian upper bounds, and a known Harnack inequality is then used to derive Gaussian lower bounds.</description>
