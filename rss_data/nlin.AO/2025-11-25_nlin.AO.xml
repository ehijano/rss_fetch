      <title>Collective Turns in Spinless Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a minimal aggregation-based model, we address the efficient information transfer observed in natural flocks during collective turns. Specifically, we demonstrate that this feature can arise solely from the non-reciprocal nature of local interactions. Through a perturbative analysis, moreover, we find that velocity fluctuations (in the continuum) can be described by a Born approximation. We then show that a wave propagating across the flock undergoes scattering. Our model provides testable predictions and can be extended to study other physical contexts exhibiting polar order.</description>

      <title>Phase reduction of reaction-diffusion systems with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a phase reduction method for reaction-diffusion systems with a discrete delay. On the basis of the recent developments in the phase reduction theory for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a bilinear form tailored to spatially extended systems involving a discrete delay. By solving the adjoint equation associated with the bilinear form, we obtain the phase sensitivity function, which quantifies the shift of the phase in response to a given perturbation. The theory is verified numerically with the use of the Schnakenberg system with a discrete delay in one spatial dimension. We further demonstrate the utility of the theory by optimizing the interaction between a pair of the Schnakenberg systems, with the use of the phase equation, for maximizing the stability of in-phase synchronization. This study serves as a step towards establishing a theory for analyzing oscillatory systems that involve both spatial degrees of freedom and delay.</description>

      <title>Failure of LMC statistical complexity in identifying structural order in the XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying complexity in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge, and many proposed measures fail to capture the structural features that intuitive or theoretical considerations would demand. Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load dynamics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics have not been affected by the mass vaccination policies in Italy.</description>

      <title>Evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games: Dynamical and information-theoretical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>When Does Population Diversity Matter? A Unified Framework for Binary-Choice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for binary-choice dynamics in which agents update their states using two mechanisms selected based on individual preference drawn from an arbitrary distribution. We compare annealed dynamics, where preferences change over time, and quenched dynamics, where they remain fixed. Our framework bridges gaps between existing models and provides a systematic approach to assess when individual-level diversity affects collective dynamics and when it can be effectively ignored. We identify a constraint on transition probabilities that makes annealed and quenched dynamics equivalent. We show that when this condition is satisfied, the quenched dynamics reduces to a one-dimensional system, ruling out oscillatory behavior that may otherwise emerge.</description>
