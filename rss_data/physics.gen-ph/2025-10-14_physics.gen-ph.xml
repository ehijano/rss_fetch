      <title>Closed-Form Canonical-Scalar Black Hole with de Sitter Core and Schwarzschild-(A)dS Exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.02078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular (non-singular) black holes with de Sitter cores are often constructed by prescribing effective mass functions or anisotropic vacuum fluids, or by invoking phantom scalars that violate energy conditions. Constructions with canonical self-interacting scalars in asymptotically flat spacetimes and inverse reconstruction schemes do exist, but they rarely produce a fully closed-form potential that smoothly matches a de Sitter core to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS exterior. Here we present a fully analytic, static, spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system with a minimally coupled canonical scalar. Working in a two-function metric gauge and adopting a simple monotone kink profile that interpolates between two vacuum energies, we reconstruct the scalar potential directly from the field equations; for zero mass parameter it reduces to a quintic polynomial in a natural interpolation variable. The resulting configuration is everywhere regular, fixes the redshift algebraically, requires neither thin shells nor modified gravity, and realizes a de Sitter core matched to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS exterior with explicitly characterizable horizons. This compact closed-form model furnishes a convenient analytic benchmark for studies of horizon structure, thermodynamics, stability, and AdS applications within a canonical matter sector.</description>

      <title>Anchored Motion: Mechanical Impedance and the Physics of Faster-Than-the-Wind Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-documented yet counterintuitive fact that propeller-driven vehicles can travel directly downwind faster than the wind itself. The effect is not paradoxical once one recognizes that the vehicle is not pushed by the air alone but operates as a coupled mechanical system that extracts energy from the velocity difference between two media -- the moving air and the stationary ground or water. The ground provides the indispensable mechanical impedance, serving as an anchor that allows the drivetrain to convert relative motion into thrust. Through the analogies of a gearbox, a lever, and a sliding-boat thought experiment, this work shows that faster-than-the-wind travel arises naturally from the exchange of energy between coupled media and the presence of a fixed reference that sustains that exchange.</description>
