      <title>Polynomial decay of correlations of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a construction of a smooth realization of a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of a Riemannian surface, and show that it admits a unique SRB measure with polynomial decay of correlations, large deviations, and the central limit theorem. The construction begins with a linear pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism whose singularities are fixed points. Near the singularities, the trajectories are slowed down, and then the map is conjugated with a homeomorphism that pushes mass away from the origin. The resulting map is a $C^{2+\epsilon}$ diffeomorphism topologically conjugate to the original pseudo-Anosov map. To prove that this map has polynomial decay of correlations, our main technique is to use the fact that this map has a Young tower, and study the decay of the tail of the first return time to the base of the tower.</description>

      <title>Infinite unrestricted sumsets in subsets of abelian groups with large density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(G,+)$ be a countable abelian group such that the subgroup $\{g+g\colon g\in G\}$ has finite index and the doubling map $g\mapsto g+g$ has finite kernel. We establish lower bounds on the upper density of a set $A\subset G$ with respect to an appropriate F{\o}lner sequence, so that $A$ contains a sumset of the form $\{t+b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2\in B\}$ or $\{b_1+b_2\colon b_1,b_2\in B\}$, for some infinite $B\subset G$ and some $t\in G$. Both assumptions on $G$ are necessary for our results to be true. We also characterize the F{\o}lner sequences for which this is possible. Finally, we show that our lower bounds are optimal in a strong sense.</description>

      <title>Localization for Random Schr\"odinger Operators Defined by Block Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with random potentials obtained via a block code applied to an i.i.d. sequence of random variables. It is shown that, almost surely, these operators exhibit spectral and dynamical localization, the latter away from a finite set of exceptional energies. We make no assumptions beyond non-triviality, neither on the regularity of the underlying random variables, nor on the linearity, the monotonicity, or even the continuity of the block code. Central to our proof is a reduction to the non-stationary Anderson model via Fubini.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for random matrix products and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain natural families of topologies, we study continuity and stability of statistical properties of random walks on linear groups over local fields. We extend large deviation results known in the Archimedean case to non-Archimedean local fields and also demonstrate certain large deviation estimates for heavy tailed distributions unknown even in the Archimedean case. A key technical result, which may be of independent interest, establishes lower semi-continuity for the gap between the first and second Lyapunov exponents. As applications, we are able to obtain a key technical step towards a localization proof for heavy tailed Anderson models (the full proof appearing in a companion article), and show continuity/stability (taking the geometric data as input) of various statistical data associated to hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Optimal selection of the most informative nodes for a noisy DeGroot model with stubborn agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the optimal subset of individuals to observe in order to obtain the best estimate of the average opinion of a society is a crucial problem in a wide range of applications, including policy-making, strategic business decisions, and the analysis of sociological trends. We consider the opinion vector X to be updated according to a DeGroot opinion dynamical model with stubborn agents, subject to perturbations from external random noise, which can be interpreted as transmission errors. The objective function of the optimization problem is the variance reduction achieved by observing the equilibrium opinions of a subset K of agents. We demonstrate that, under this specific setting, the objective function exhibits the property of submodularity. This allows us to effectively design a Greedy Algorithm to solve the problem, significantly reducing its computational complexity. Simple examples are provided to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of continued fraction convergents in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_m)$ with an application to local discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the sequence of continued fraction convergents $p_n/q_n$ to a random irrational number. We study the distribution of the sequences $p_n \pmod{m}$ and $q_n \pmod{m}$ with a fixed modulus $m$, and more generally, the distribution of the $2 \times 2$ matrix with entries $p_{n-1}, p_n, q_{n-1}, q_n \pmod{m}$. Improving the strong law of large numbers due to Sz\"usz, Moeckel, Jager and Liardet, we establish the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm, as well as the weak and the almost sure invariance principles. As an application, we find the limit distribution of the maximum and the minimum of the Birkhoff sum for the irrational rotation with the indicator of an interval as test function. We also compute the normalizing constant in a classical limit law for the same Birkhoff sum due to Kesten, and dispel a misconception about its dependence on the test interval.</description>

      <title>Classification of connection graphs of global attractors for $S^1$-equivariant parabolic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15581v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the characterization of global attractors $A_f$ for semiflows generated by scalar one-dimensional semilinear parabolic equations of the form $u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x)$, defined on the circle $x\in S^1$, for a class of reversible nonlinearities. Given two reversible nonlinearities, $f_0$ and $f_1$, with the same lap signature, we prove the existence of a reversible homotopy $f_\tau, 0\le\tau\le 1$, which preserves all heteroclinic connections. Consequently, we obtain a classification of the connection graphs of global attractors in the class of reversible nonlinearities. We also describe bifurcation diagrams which reduce a global attractor $A_1$ to the trivial global attractor $A_0=\{0\}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps and Fourier decay for self-conformal measures in the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a $C^\omega (\mathbb{C})$ self-conformal IFS on the plane, satisfying some mild non-linearity and irreducibility conditions. We prove a uniform spectral gap estimate for the transfer operator corresponding to the derivative cocycle and every given self-conformal measure. Building on this result, we establish polynomial Fourier decay for any such measure. Our technique is based on a refinement of a method of Oh-Winter (2017) where we do not require separation from the IFS or the Federer property for the underlying measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any sequence of integers satisfying necessary Dold's congruences is realized as the sequence of fixed point indices of the iterates of an orientation-reversing homeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ for $m\geq 3$. As an element of the construction of the above homeomorphism, we consider the class of boundary-preserving homeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}$ and give the answer to [Problem 10.2, Topol. Methods Nonlinear Anal. 50 (2017), 643 - 667] providing a complete description of the forms of fixed point indices for this class of maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine Bhargava's geometry-of-numbers methods with the dynamical point-counting methods of Eskin--McMullen and Benoist--Oh to develop a new technique for counting integral points on symmetric varieties lying within fundamental domains for coregular representations. As applications, we study the distribution of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group in thin families of cubic number fields, as well as the distribution of the $2$-Selmer groups in thin families of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. For example, our results suggest that the existence of a generator of the ring of integers with small norm has an increasing effect on the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group, relative to the Cohen--Lenstra predictions.</description>

      <title>Smooth linear eigenvalue statistics on random covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces -- A central limit theorem and almost sure RMT statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth linear spectral statistics of twisted Laplacians on random $n$-covers of a fixed compact hyperbolic surface $X$. We consider two aspects of such statistics. The first is the fluctuations of such statistics in a small energy window around a fixed energy level when averaged over the space of all degree $n$ covers of $X$. The second is the energy variance of a typical surface.
  In the first case, we show a central limit theorem. Specifically, we show that the distribution of such fluctuations tends to a Gaussian with variance given by the corresponding quantity for the Gaussian Orthogonal/Unitary Ensemble (GOE/GUE). In the second case, we show that the energy variance of a typical random $n$-cover is that of the GOE/GUE. In both cases, we consider a double limit where first we let $n$, the covering degree, go to $\infty$ then let $L\to \infty$ where $1/L$ is the window length.</description>

      <title>A systematic path to non-Markovian dynamics II: Probabilistic response of nonlinear multidimensional systems to Gaussian colored noise excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.</description>

Abstract: We address a conjecture of Mirzakhani about the statistical behavior of certain expanding families of ``twist tori'' in the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces, showing that they equidistribute to a certain Lebesgue-class measure along almost all sequences. We also identify a number of other expanding families of twist tori whose limiting distributions are mutually singular to Lebesgue.</description>
