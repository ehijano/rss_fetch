      <title>Computing ground states of Bose-Einstein condensation by normalized deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a normalized deep neural network (norm-DNN) for computing ground states of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) via the minimization of the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional under unitary mass normalization. Compared with the traditional deep neural network for solving partial differential equations, two additional layers are added in training our norm-DNN for solving this kind of unitary constraint minimization problems: (i) a normalization layer is introduced to enforce the unitary mass normalization, and (ii) a shift layer is added to guide the training to non-negative ground state. The proposed norm-DNN gives rise to an efficient unsupervised approach for learning ground states of BEC. Systematical investigations are first carried out through extensive numerical experiments for computing ground states of BEC in one dimension. Extensions to high dimensions and multi-component are then studied in details. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of norm-DNN for learning ground states of BEC. Finally, we extend the norm-DNN for computing the first excited states of BEC and discuss parameter generalization issues as well as compare with some existing machine learning methods for computing ground states of BEC in the literature.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, information and non-equilibrium phase transitions in long-range open quantum Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium phase transitions of open quantum systems generically exhibit diverging classical but not quantum correlations. Still entanglement -- characterizing the latter correlations -- can be sensitive to the phase transition. Furthermore, mutual information, bounding the total correlations, should exhibit critical scaling at the transition. In this work, we study these quantities in the steady state of open quantum Ising chains with power-law interactions (with the exponent $0\le \alpha \le 3$) where spins are subject to spontaneous emission. The bulk of this paper is dedicated to a detailed analytical as well as numerical analysis of the infinite-range model ($\alpha=0$), a model that is closely related to the paradigmatic open Dicke model. Our main findings are that the entanglement, while being finite, peaks, exhibits a kink and takes a universal value at the transition, while the mutual information exhibits critical scaling not only at the transition but well into the ordered phase, underscoring a hidden criticality that is not captured by (two-point) correlations. We consider three distinct entanglement measures: logarithmic negativity; quantum Fisher information; and, spin squeezing. Specifically, we show that the collective spin operator that maximizes the quantum Fisher information can be identified with the \textit{gapless} mode of the phase transition, while the squeezed direction is that of the \textit{gapped} mode. Finally, we investigate power-law interacting models using matrix product states where we find comparable bounds on squeezing even when no phase transition is expected (for larger $\alpha$), thus the connection to the phase transition does not appear to hold for shorter-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of photons in degenerate plasmas: a field-theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, many practical results are often derived using classical or semiclassical approximations, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing novel couplings absent in classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both the kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity field, which are important in degenerate conditions.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent localization of spin-orbit and Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the spin-orbit (SO) and Rabi couplings on the localization of the spin-1/2 condensate trapped in a one-dimensional random potential. Our studies reveal that the spin-dependent couplings create distinct localization regimes, resulting in various relations between localization and spin-related properties. First, we examine the localization in the linear condensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the localized state from the "basin-like" to the "void" region of the potential. For a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a re-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a higher SO coupling. Further, we analyze the competing role of inter-species and intra-species interactions on the localization of the condensate. We find the appearance of spin-dependent localization as the interactions increase beyond threshold values for a sufficiently strong disorder. Our findings on controlling spin-dependent localization may be useful for future ultracold atomic experiments and corresponding spin-related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation to equilibrium in Bose-Hubbard rings is numerically investigated in the time domain. We show that for small mean site populations in the Mott insulator regime, characterized by strong onsite interaction as compared to hopping, equipartition starting from nonequilibrium initial states is significantly faster in these bosonic quantum many-body systems than in their classical counterparts, given by discrete Gross-Pitaevskii lattices. We attribute this phenomenon of thermalization enhancement to a genuine quantum transport mechanism akin to tunneling, allowing for pathways that are more efficient than chaotic diffusion across the ergodic domain of the classical systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Higgs and Goldstone modes in U(1) symmetry-broken Rydberg atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs and Goldstone modes manifest as fluctuations in the order parameter of system, offering insights into its phase transitions and symmetry properties. Exploring the dynamics of these collective excitations in a Rydberg atoms system advances various branches of condensed matter, particle physics, and cosmology. Here, we report an experimental signature of Higgs and Goldstone modes in a U(1) symmetry-broken Rydberg atomic gases. By constructing two probe fields to excite atoms, we observe the distinct phase and amplitude fluctuations of Rydberg atoms collective excitations under the particle-hole symmetry. Due to the van der Waals interactions between the Rydberg atoms, we detect a symmetric variance spectrum divided by the divergent regime and phase boundary, capturing the full dynamics of the additional Higgs and Goldstone modes. Studying the Higgs and Goldstone modes in Rydberg atoms allows us to explore fundamental aspects of quantum phase transitions and symmetry breaking phenomena, while leveraging the unique properties of these highly interacting systems to uncover new physics and potential applications in quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Vortex bound states in dimerized $\pi$-flux optical lattices: characterization, state preparation and current measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models display bound states for repulsive interactions that smoothly connect to high-energy two-particle states of doubly occupied sites, namely doublons, for strong onsite interactions. In this work, we show that a distinct type of repulsively bound states, namely vortex bound states of two bosons, appear in dimerized square lattices pierced by a uniform $\pi$-flux for moderate interactions. By focusing on a ladder geometry as an illustrative example, we characterize their properties, including chirality-changing decay channels induced by flux detuning, and we develop protocols to perform state preparation in optical lattices via adiabatic sequences or recently developed current imprinting methods. Finally, we show how to measure currents and thus chirality by quenching the system onto isolated pairs of nearest-neighbor sites and then sampling the corresponding dynamics. These results can also provide an experimentally realistic strategy for state preparation and probing of chiral gapped many-body phases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled mean-field Bose gas at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas with repulsive mean-field interparticle interactions. We analyze the phase diagram of the system varying the temperature $T&gt;0$, the chemical potentials, as well as interparticle and spin-orbit interaction couplings. Our results indicate that, for Rashba- and Weyl-type spin-orbit couplings, condensates featuring ordering wavevector $\vec{Q}\neq \vec{0}$ are fragile with respect to thermal fluctuations and, at $T&gt;0$, the only stable thermodynamic phases involving the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are those of uniform type with $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$. On the other hand, presence of the spin-orbit coupling stabilizes the $\vec{Q}=\vec{0}$ BEC state at any dimensionality $d&gt;1$ and modifies either the order or the universality class of the corresponding phase transition. We emphasize the singular nature of the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interaction coupling $v$, sizable shifts of the phase boundaries upon varying $v$, as well as the role of the relative magnitudes of the interparticle interaction couplings for the character of the condensation transition.</description>

      <title>Transport of magnetically sensitive atoms in a magnetic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. However, creating a quantum gas microscope with these atoms presents challenges, primarily because of the need to transfer the atoms from the main cooling chamber to another chamber with large optical access. Stray magnetic fields complicate this transfer by exerting forces on the atoms. Using thulium atoms as an example, the study demonstrates that stray magnetic fields can be measured directly using the atoms themselves, allowing for these fields to be accounted for during the transfer process. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of the transfer, allowing to transfer over 1/3 of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 56 cm away.</description>

      <title>Ring-exchange physics in a chain of three-level ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of ring exchange interactions, bosons in a ladder-like lattice may form the bosonic analogon of a correlated metal, known as the d-wave Bose liquid (DBL). In this Letter, we show that a chain of trapped ions with three internal levels can be used to mimic a ladder-like system constrained to a maximum occupation of one boson per rung. The setup enables tunable ring exchange interactions, giving rise to a transition between a polarized regime with all bosons confined to one leg and the DBL regime. The latter state is characterized by a splitting of the peak in the momentum distribution and an oscillating pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Scattering Theory of Chiral Edge Modes in Topological Magnon Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological magnon insulators exhibit robust edge modes with chiral properties similar to quantum Hall edge states. However, due to their strong localization at the edges, interactions between these chiral edge magnons can be significant, as we show in a model of coupled magnon-conserving spin chains in an electric field gradient. The chiral edge modes remain edge-localized and do not scatter into the bulk, and we characterize their scattering phase: for strongly-localized edge modes we observe significant deviation from the bare scattering phase. This renormalization of edge scattering can be attributed to bound bulk modes resonating with the chiral edge magnons, in the spirit of Feshbach resonances in atomic physics. We argue a real-time measurement protocol using spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to study their scattering dynamics. Our result show that interaction among magnons can be encoded in an effective edge model of reduced dimensionality, where the interactions with the bulk renormalize the effective couplings. This work paves the way to develop a many-body effective theory for chiral edge magnons.</description>

      <title>Boundary-driven many-body phase transitions in a non-Hermitian disordered fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the boundary sensitivity of a non-Hermitian interacting system in the presence of a random disorder potential. A non-zero boundary parameter results in real-complex spectral phase transitions with non-reciprocal (or unidirectional) hopping at weak disorder. While the many-body localization at strong disorder washes away spectral transitions leading to dynamical stability and real eigenvalue spectrum. We show that the boundary-driven spectral transitions of the non-Hermitian chain are accompanied by the corresponding changes in the level statistics and nearest level-spacing distributions. The intriguing features of non-reciprocity and boundary sensitivity are further revealed using the averaged inverse participation ratios. Finally, we find distinct behaviour in the quench dynamics of local particle density, population imbalance, and entanglement entropy of charge-density-wave ordered state that corroborate the spectral and localization transitions. Our results provide a route to understanding disordered many-body systems under a generalized boundary.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum caustics in the dynamics of interacting particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have predicted the existence of caustics in many-body quantum dynamics, where they manifest as extended regions of enhanced probability density that obey temporal and spatial scaling relations. Focusing on the transverse-field Ising model, we investigate the dynamics initiated by a local quench in a spin chain, resulting in outward-propagating excitations that create a distinct caustic pattern. We calculate the scaling of the first two maxima of the interference fringes dressing the caustic, finding a universal exponent of 2/3, associated with an Airy function catastrophe. We demonstrate that this property is universal in the entire paramagnetic phase of the model, and starts varying at the quantum phase transition (QPT). This robust scaling persists even under perturbations that break the integrability of the model. We additionally explore the effect of boundary conditions and find that open boundaries introduce significant edge effects, leading to complex interference patterns. Despite these edge-induced dynamics, the overall power-law scaling exponent remains robust. These findings highlight the potential of quantum caustics as a powerful diagnostic tool for QPTs, demonstrating resilience against integrability-breaking perturbations and boundary condition variations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic coupling through flux branching of adjacent type-I and -II superconductors in a neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner and outer cores of neutron stars are believed to contain type-I and -II proton superconductors, respectively. The type-I superconductor exists in an intermediate state, comprising macroscopic flux-free and flux-containing regions, while the type-II superconductor is flux-free, except for microscopic, quantized flux tubes. Here, we show that the inner and outer cores are coupled magnetically, when the macroscopic flux tubes subdivide dendritically into quantized flux tubes, a phenomenon called flux branching. An important implication is that up to $\sim 10^{12} (r_1/10^6 \, {\rm cm}) \, {\rm erg}$ of energy are required to separate a quantized flux tube from its progenitor macroscopic flux tube, where $r_1$ is the length of the macroscopic flux tube. Approximating the normal-superconducting boundary as sharp, we calculate the magnetic coupling energy between a quantized and macroscopic flux tube due to flux branching as a function of, $f_1$, the radius of the type-I inner core divided by the radius of the type-II outer core. Strong coupling delays magnetic field decay in the type-II superconductor. For an idealised inner core containing only a type-I proton superconductor and poloidal flux, and in the absence of ambipolar diffusion and diamagnetic screening, the low magnetic moments ($\lesssim 10^{27} \, {\rm G \, cm^3}$) of recycled pulsars imply $f_1 \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced phase transitions at topological quantum criticality of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological phases at quantum criticality attract much attention recently. Here we numerically study the interaction-induced phase transitions at around the topological quantum critical points of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. This extended SSH model shows topological phase transitions between the topologically trivial and nontrivial critical phases when interaction is absent. So long as the interaction terms are turned on, the topologically nontrivial (trivial) critical phases are driven into topologically nontrivial (trivial) insulator phases with finite energy gaps. Particularly, we find the trivial insulator phase is further driven to the nontrivial insulator phase, through interaction-induced topological phase transition, although interaction generally is harmful to nontrivial topology. The stability of trivial insulator phase against interaction tends to vanish at the multicritical point that separates the trivial and nontrivial critical phases. Our work provides a concrete example for manifesting the impact of interaction on topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Geometric Floquet theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. This allows us to introduce a unique gauge-invariant formulation, decomposing the dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical Kato operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a unique Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain; we show that the geometric contribution to the evolution accounts for inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy gap in discrete time crystals or edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the Kato operator elucidates the origin of both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates; this enables the direct application of shortcuts-to-adiabaticity techniques to Floquet engineering, turning it into an explicit algorithmic procedure. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>The interaction-sensitive states of a trapped two-component ideal Fermi gas and application to the virial expansion of the unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.06543v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a two-component ideal Fermi gas in an isotropic harmonic potential. Some eigenstates have a wavefunction that vanishes when two distinguishable fermions are at the same location, and would be unaffected by s-wave contact interactions between the two components. We determine the other, interaction-sensitive eigenstates, using a Faddeev ansatz. This problem is nontrivial, due to degeneracies and to the existence of unphysical Faddeev solutions. As an application we present a new conjecture for the fourth-order cluster or virial coefficient of the unitary Fermi gas, in good agreement with the numerical results of Blume and coworkers.</description>

      <title>Incommensurable matter-wave jets in quasi-1D geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

      <title>Shell-shaped quantum droplet in a three-component ultracold Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is a typical quantum system in curved geometry. Here we propose a new type of shell-shaped BEC with self-bound character, thereby liberating it from stringent conditions such as microgravity or fine-tuned trap. Specifically, we consider a three-component (1,2,3) ultracold Bose gas where (1,2) and (2,3) both form quantum droplets. The two droplets are mutually immiscible due to strong 1-3 repulsion, while still linked by component-2 to form a globally self-bound object. The outer droplet then naturally develops a shell structure without any trapping potential. It is shown that the shell structure can significantly modify the equilibrium density of the core, and lead to unique collective excitations highlighting the core-shell correlation. All results have been demonstrated in a realistic $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K-$^{41}$K mixture. By extending quantum droplets from flat to curved geometries, this work paves the way for future exploring the interplay of quantum fluctuations and non-trivial real-space topologies in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay and nucleation dynamics in neutral atom systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states of quantum many-body systems with confinement offer a means to simulate false vacuum phenomenology, including non-equilibrium dynamical processes like decay by nucleation, in truncated limits. Recent work has examined the decay process in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the metastable and ground states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the metastable state from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Long-lived oscillations of metastable states in neutral atom systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. The phenomenology of metastable states has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of metastable and ground states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of short-range meson repulsion. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <title>Multifold Majorana corner modes arising from multiple pairs of helical edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators with a pair of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity have been shown to support second-order topological superconductors with Majorana corner modes. As the Majorana corner modes are originated from the helical edge states of the quantum spin Hall insulators, whether quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states and proximity-induced superconductivity can give rise to second-order topological superconductors with multifold Majorana corner modes is an interesting question to address. In this work, we consider a quantum spin Hall insulator with two pairs of helical edge states. We find robust twofold Majorana corner modes can be achieved when the helical edge states are gapped by a combined action of a magnetic exchange field and an $s$-wave pairing, or an $s+p$ mixed-parity pairing. The stability of two Majorana zero modes per corner under the action of magnetic exchange fields is attributed to the protection from the chiral symmetry. Our study reveals that heterostructures composed of superconductors and quantum spin Hall insulators with multiple pairs of helical edge states could serve as a platform to pursue multifold Majorana corner modes.</description>
