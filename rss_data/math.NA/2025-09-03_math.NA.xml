      <title>A quasi-Trefftz space for a second order time-harmonic Maxwell's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Trefftz methods are a family of Discontinuous Galerkin methods relying on equation-dependent function spaces. This work is the first study of the notion of local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz space for a system of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). These discrete spaces are introduced here for electro-magnetic wave propagation in inhomogeneous media, governed by a second order formulation of Maxwell's equation with variable coefficients. Thanks to an adequate Helmholtz decomposition for spaces of homogeneous polynomial vector fields, the outcome is the explicit dimension of the proposed quasi-Trefftz space as well as a procedure to construct quasi-Trefftz functions.</description>

      <title>WoSNN: Stochastic Solver for PDEs with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental step in various scientific and engineering studies. As a classic stochastic solver, the Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) method is a well-established and efficient algorithm that provides accurate local estimates for PDEs. In this paper, by integrating machine learning techniques with WoS and space discretization approaches, we develop a novel stochastic solver, WoS-NN. This new method solves elliptic problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, facilitating precise and rapid global solutions and gradient approximations. The method inherits excellent characteristics from the original WoS method, such as being meshless and robust to irregular regions. By integrating neural networks, WoS-NN also gives instant local predictions after training without re-sampling, which is especially suitable for intense requests on a static region. A typical experimental result demonstrates that the proposed WoS-NN method provides accurate field estimations, reducing errors by around $75\%$ while using only $8\%$ of path samples compared to the conventional WoS method, which saves abundant computational time and resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence Extraction of Upwind Discontinuous Galerkin Method Solving the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the superconvergence of the upwind discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for both the steady-state and time-dependent radiative transfer equation (RTE), and apply the Smooth-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filters to enhance the accuracy order. Direct application of SIAC filters on low-dimensional macroscopic moments, often the quantities of practical interest, can effectively improve the approximation accuracy with marginal computational overhead.
  Using piecewise $k$-th order polynomials for the approximation and assuming constant cross sections, we prove $(2k+2)$-th order superconvergence for the steady-state problem at Radau points on each element and $(2k+1/2)$-th order superconvergence for the global $L^2$ and negative-order Sobolev norms for the time-dependent problem.
  Numerical experiments confirm the efficacy of the filtering, demonstrating post-filter convergence orders of $2k+2$ for steady-state and $2k+1$ for time-dependent problems. More significantly, the SIAC filter delivers substantial gains in computational efficiency. For a time-dependent problem, we observed an approximately $2.22 \times$ accuracy improvement and a $19.94 \times$ reduction in computational time. For the steady-state problems, the filter achieved a $4$--$9 \times$ acceleration without any loss of accuracy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on explicit numerical approximations for nonlinear hybrid stochastic functional differential equations with infinite delay. Precisely, explicit truncated Euler-Maruyama schemes are proposed, $2p$th $(p \ge 1)$ moment boundedness and strong convergence of the numerical solutions are obtained. Under slightly stronger conditions, the $1/2$ order convergence rate is established. Furthermore, the exponential stability, including moment and almost sure exponential stability, is examined. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>A Mixed Precision Eigensolver Based on the Jacobi Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic method for computing the spectral decomposition of a real symmetric matrix, the Jacobi algorithm, can be accelerated by using mixed precision arithmetic. The Jacobi algorithm is aiming to reduce the off-diagonal entries iteratively using Givens rotations. We investigate how to use the low precision to speed up this algorithm based on the approximate spectral decomposition in low precision.
  We first study two different index choosing techniques, classical and cyclic-by-row, for the Jacobi algorithm. Numerical testing suggests that cyclic-by-row is more efficient. Then we discuss two different methods of orthogonalizing an almost orthogonal matrix: the QR factorization and the polar decomposition. For polar decomposition, we speed up the Newton iteration by using the one-step Schulz iteration. Based on numerical testing, using the polar decomposition approach (Newton--Schulz iteration) is not only faster but also more accurate than using the QR factorization.
  A mixed precision algorithm for computing the spectral decomposition of a real symmetric matrix at double precision is provided. In doing so we compute the approximate eigenvector matrix $Q_\ell$ of $A$ in single precision using $\texttt{eig}$ and $\texttt{single}$ in MATLAB. We then use the Newton--Schulz iteration to orthogonalize the eigenvector matrix $Q_\ell$ into an orthogonal matrix $Q_d$ in double precision. Finally, we apply the cyclic-by-row Jacobi algorithm on $Q_d^TAQ_d$ and obtain the spectral decomposition of $A$. At this stage, we will see, from the testings, the cyclic-by-row Jacobi algorithm only need less than 10 iterations to converge by utilizing the quadratic convergence. The new mixed precision algorithm requires roughly 30\% of the time used by the Jacobi algorithm on its own.</description>

      <title>On discrete Sobolev inequalities for nonconforming finite elements under a semi-regular mesh condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a discrete $ L^q-L^p$ Sobolev inequality tailored for the Crouzeix--Raviart and discontinuous Crouzeix--Raviart finite element spaces on anisotropic meshes in both two and three dimensions. Subject to a semi-regular mesh condition, this discrete Sobolev inequality is applicable to all pairs $(q,p)$ that align with the local Sobolev embedding, including scenarios where $q \leq p$. Importantly, the constant is influenced solely by the domain and the semi-regular parameter, ensuring robustness against variations in aspect ratios and interior angles of the mesh. The proof employs an anisotropy-sensitive trace inequality that leverages the element height, a two-step affine/Piola mapping approach, the stability of the Raviart--Thomas interpolation, and a discrete integration-by-parts identity augmented with weighted jump/trace terms on faces. This Sobolev inequality serves as a mesh-robust foundation for the stability and error analysis of nonconforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods on highly anisotropic meshes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to investigating the adaptive Euler-Maruyama (EM) schemes for the approximation of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with common noise. When the drift and diffusion coefficients both satisfy the superlinear growth conditions, the $L^p$ convergence rates in finite and infinite horizons are revealed, which reacts to the particle number and step size. Subsequently, there is an illustration of the theory results by means of two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Stabilization techniques for immersogeometric analysis of plate and shell problems in explicit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element plate and shell formulations are ubiquitous in structural analysis for modeling all kinds of slender structures, both for static and dynamic analyses. The latter are particularly challenging as the high order nature of the underlying partial differential equations and the slenderness of the structures all impose a stringent constraint on the critical time step in explicit dynamics. Unfortunately, badly cut elements in immersed finite element discretizations further aggravate the issue. While lumping the mass matrix often increases the critical time step, it might also trigger spurious oscillations in the approximate solution thereby compromising the numerical solution. In this article, we extend our previous work in \cite{voet2025stabilization} to allow stable immersogeometric analysis of plate and shell problems with lumped mass matrices. This technique is based on polynomial extensions and restores a level of accuracy comparable to boundary-fitted discretizations.</description>

      <title>Numerical solution of 2D boundary value problems on merged Voronoi-Delaunay meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational technologies for the approximate solution of multidimensional boundary value problems often rely on irregular computational meshes and finite-volume approximations. In this framework, the discrete problem represents the corresponding conservation law for control volumes associated with the nodes of the mesh. This approach is most naturally and consistently implemented using Delaunay triangulations together with Voronoi diagrams as control volumes. In this paper, we employ meshes with nodes located both at the vertices of Delaunay triangulations and at the generators of Voronoi partitions. The cells of the merged Voronoi-Delaunay mesh are orthodiagonal quadrilaterals. On such meshes, scalar and vector functions, as well as invariant gradient and divergence operators of vector calculus, can be conveniently approximated. We illustrate the capabilities of this approach by solving a steady-state diffusion-reaction problem in an anisotropic medium.</description>

      <title>A level-set based finite difference method for the ground state Bose-Einstein condensates in smooth bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a level-set based finite difference method to calculate the ground states of Bose Einstein condensates in domains with curved boundaries. Our method draws on the variational and level set approaches, benefiting from both of their long-standing success. More specifically, we use the normalized gradient flow, where the spatial discretization is based on the simple Cartesian grid with fictitious values in the outer vicinity of the domains. We develop a PDE-based extension technique that systematically and automatically constructs ghost point values with third-order accuracy near irregular boundaries, effectively circumventing the computational complexity of interpolation in these regions. Another novel aspect of our work is the application of the PDE-based extension technique to a nodal basis function, resulting in an explicit ghost value mapping that can be seamlessly incorporated into implicit time-stepping methods where the extended function values are treated as unknowns at the next time step. We present numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including its application to domains with corners and to problems involving higher-order interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast iterative method for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fast and robust iterative scheme for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Monge-Amp\`ere equation is a nonlinear and degenerate equation, with applications in optimal transport, geometric optics, and differential geometry. The proposed method linearises the equation and uses a fixed-point iteration (L-scheme), solving a Poisson problem in each step with a weighted residual as the right-hand side. This algorithm is robust against discretisation, nonlinearities, and degeneracies. For a weight greater than the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, contraction in $H^2$ and $L^\infty$ is proven for both classical and generalised solutions, respectively. The method's performance can be enhanced by using preconditioners or Green's functions. Test cases demonstrate that the scheme outperforms Newton's method in speed and stability.</description>

      <title>An Inexact Low-Rank Source Iteration for Steady-State Radiative Transfer Equation with Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an inexact low-rank source iteration with diffusion synthetic acceleration (SI-DSA) for solving the multidimensional steady-state radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the second-order formulation. The angular flux is represented in either a low-rank matrix or hierarchical Tucker tensor (HTT) format, enabling substantial reductions in computational resources. Each SI step is solved using a preconditioned low-rank conjugate gradient (CG) method with a diffusion preconditioner. To further improve efficiency, we introduce an adaptive inexact strategy that dynamically relaxes the inner CG tolerance during early SI iterations. The method exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretized operators to perform all matrix-vector operations in low-rank form. Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including diffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees of freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case, the low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\times$ over its full-rank counterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated and multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our knowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for multidimensional steady-state RTE.</description>

      <title>On the numerical computation of $R_0$ in periodic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to approximate the basic reproduction number $R_0$ as spectral radius of the Next-Generation Operator in time-periodic population models by characterizing the latter via evolution semigroups. Once birth/infection and transition operators are identified, we discretize them via either Fourier or Chebyshev collocation methods. Then $R_0$ is obtained by solving a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem. The order of convergence of the approximating reproduction numbers to the true one is shown to depend on the regularity of the model coefficients, and spectral accuracy is proved. We validate the theoretical results by discussing applications to epidemiology, viz. a large-size multi-group epidemic model with periodic contact rates, and a vector-borne disease model with seasonal vector recruitment. We illustrate how the method facilitates implementation compared to existing approaches and how it can be easily adapted to also compute type-reproduction numbers.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for strong discrete maximum principles in finite element solutions of linear and semilinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for proving global strong discrete maximum principles for finite element discretizations of linear and semilinear elliptic equations for cases when the common, matrix-based sufficient conditions are not satisfied. The basic argument consists of extending the strong form of discrete maximum principle from macroelements to the entire domain via a connectivity argument. The method is applied to discretizations of elliptic equations with certain pathological meshes, and to semilinear elliptic equations.</description>

      <title>Deep Tangent Bundle (DTB) method: a Deep Neural Network approach to compute solutions of PDES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a numerical framework, the Deep Tangent Bundle (DTB) method, that is suitable for computing solutions of evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) in high dimensions. The main idea is to use the tangent bundle of an adaptively updated deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the vector field in the spatial variables while applying the traditional schemes for time discretization. The DTB method takes advantage of the expression power of DNNs and the simplicity of the tangent bundle approximation. It does not involve nonconvex optimization. Several numerical examples demonstrate that the DTB is simple, flexible, and efficient for various PDEs of higher dimensions.</description>

The proposed method employs hybrid coefficient to provide accurate macroscopic information while preserving essential microscopic details within specified local defects. Both the macroscopic and microscopic errors have been improved compared to existing results, eliminating the factor of $\Delta t^{-1/2}$ when the diffusion coefficient is time-independent. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures both global and local solution behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Numerical Method for Harmonic Maps Between High-genus Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by geometry processing for surfaces with non-trivial topology, we study discrete harmonic maps between closed surfaces of genus at least two. Harmonic maps provide a natural framework for comparing surfaces by minimizing distortion. Unlike conformal or isometric maps-which may not exist between surfaces with different geometries-harmonic maps always exist within a fixed homotopy class and yield optimal homeomorphisms when the target surface has negative curvature. We develop a structure-preserving algorithm to compute harmonic maps from a triangulated surface to a reference hyperbolic surface. The method minimizes Dirichlet energy over geodesic realizations of the surface graph into the target hyperbolic surface in the homotopy class of a homeomorphism. A central feature of our framework is the use of canonical edge weights derived from the hyperbolic metric, which generalize the classical cotangent weights from the Euclidean setting. These weights preserve injectivity and ensure that isometries remain harmonic in the discrete theory, reflecting their classical behavior.</description>

      <title>Linear, decoupled, second-order and structure-preserving scheme for Carreau fluid equations coupled with steric Poisson-Nernst-Planck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, to study ionic steric effects, we present a linear, decoupled, second-order accurate in time and structure-preserving scheme with finite element approximations for Carreau fluid equations coupled with steric Poisson-Nernst-Planck (SPNP) model. The logarithmic transformation for the ion concentration is used to preserve positivity property. To deal with the nonlinear coupling terms in fluid equation, a nonlocal auxiliary variable with respect to the free energy of SPNP equations and its associated ordinary differential equation are introduced. The obtained system is equivalent to the original system. The fully discrete scheme is proved to be mass conservative, positivity-preserving for ion concentration and energy dissipative at discrete level. Some numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate its stability and accuracy. Moreover, the ionic steric effects are numerically investigated.</description>

      <title>Linear, decoupled, positivity preserving, positive-definiteness preserving and energy stable schemes for the diffusive Oldroyd-B coupled with PNP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a first-order finite element scheme for the viscoelastic electrohydrodynamic model. The model incorporates the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations to describe the transport of ions and the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to capture the behavior of viscoelastic fluids. To preserve the positive-definiteness of the conformation tensor and the positivity of ion concentrations, we employ both logarithmic transformations. The decoupled scheme is achieved by introducing a nonlocal auxiliary variable and using the splitting technique. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to be mass conservative and energy stable at the fully discrete level. To validate the theoretical analysis, we present numerical examples that demonstrate the convergence rates and the robust performance of the schemes. The results confirm that the proposed methods accurately handle the high Weissenberg number problem (HWNP) at moderately high Weissenberg numbers. Finally, the flow structure influenced by the elastic effect within the electro-convection phenomena has been studied.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal error estimates for the approximation of stable stationary states of the elastic energy of inextensible curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish local existence and a quasi-optimal error estimate for piecewise cubic minimizers to the bending energy under a discretized inextensibility constraint. In previous research a discretization is used where the inextensibility constraint is only enforced at the nodes of the discretization. We show why this discretization leads to suboptimal convergence rates and we improve on it by also enforcing the constraint in the midpoints of each subinterval. We then use the inverse function theorem to prove existence and an error estimate for stationary states of the bending energy that yields quasi-optimal convergence. We use numerical simulations to verify the theoretical results experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of the optimal approximation of circular arcs by parametric polynomial curves is considered. The optimality relates to the curvature error. Parametric polynomial curves of low degree are used and a geometric continuity is prescribed at the boundary points of the circular arc. Analysis is done for cases of parabolic $G^0$, cubic $G^1$ and quartic $G^2$ interpolation. The comparison of the approximation of circular arcs based on curvature with the approximation based on radial error is provided.</description>

      <title>A geometrically robust unfitted boundary algebraic equation method based on discrete potentials and local basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unfitted boundary algebraic equation (BAE) method for solving elliptic partial differential equations in complex geometries. The method employs lattice Green's functions on infinite regular grids combined with discrete potential theory to construct single and double layer potentials, which is a discrete analog to boundary integral method. Local basis functions on cut cells accommodate arbitrary boundary conditions and seamlessly integrate with the boundary algebraic equations. The difference potentials framework enables efficient treatment of nonhomogeneous terms and fast computation of layer potentials via FFT-based solvers. We establish theoretical stability and convergence through a novel interpolation operator framework. Key advantages of the developed method include: dimension reduction, geometric flexibility, mesh-independent conditioning, small-cut stability, and uniform treatment of smooth and non-smooth geometries. Numerical experiments validate accuracy and robustness across ellipses and diamonds with varying aspect ratios and sharp corners, and an application of potential flows in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Global convergence of adaptive least-squares finite element methods for nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zarantonello fixed-point iteration is an established linearization scheme for quasilinear PDEs with strongly monotone and Lipschitz continuous nonlinearity. This paper presents a weighted least-squares minimization for the computation of the update of this scheme. The resulting formulation allows for a conforming finite element discretization of the primal and dual variable of the PDE with arbitrary polynomial degree. The least-squares functional provides a built-in a posteriori discretization error estimator in each linearization step motivating an adaptive Uzawa-type algorithm with an outer linearization loop and an inner adaptive mesh-refinement loop. We prove R-linear convergence of the linearization iterates for arbitrary initial guesses. Particular focus is on the role of the weights in the least-squares functional of the linearized problem and their influence on the robustness of the Zarantonello damping parameter. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This user manual is intended to provide a detailed description on model-based optimization for imaging inverse problem. Theseproblems can be particularly complex and challenging, especially for individuals without prior exposure to convex optimization orinverse problem theory, like myself. In light of this, I am writing this manual to clarify and systematically organize the mathematicalrationale underlying imaging inverse problems. This manual might not be accurate in mathmatical notion but more focus on the logicalthinking on how to solve and proceed to solve the problems. If you want to think deep about something, try to raise questions! Thismanual is seaprated into four sections, aiming to answer the following four questions: (1) What is inverse imaging problem? (2) Why optimization is used to solve the inverse imaging problem? (3) How to solve the optimization problem? (4) How to implement the optimization algorithm in real imaging system?</description>

      <title>An efficient spline-based scheme on Shishkin-type meshes for solving singularly perturbed coupled systems with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a weakly coupled system of singularly perturbed linear reaction-diffusion equations with Robin boundary conditions, where the leading terms are multiplied by small positive parameters that may differ in magnitude. The solution to this system exhibits overlapping and interacting boundary layers. To appropriately resolve these layers, we employ a standard Shishkin mesh and propose a novel modification of Bakhvalov-Shishkin mesh. A cubic spline approximation is applied at the boundary conditions, while a central difference scheme is used at the interior points. The problem is then solved on both meshes. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieves almost second-order convergence upto a logarithmic factor on the Shishkin mesh and exact second-order convergence on the modified Bakhvalov-Shishkin mesh. We present numerical results to validate the accuracy of our findings.</description>

      <title>A Million-Point Fast Trajectory Optimization Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One might argue that solving a trajectory optimization problem over a million grid points is preposterous. How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper. The computational mathematics that deliver these advancements are: (i) a Birkhoff-theoretic discretization of optimal control problems, (ii) matrix-free linear algebra leveraging Krylov-subspace methods, and (iii) a near-perfect Birkhoff preconditioner that helps achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ iteration speed with respect to the grid size,~$N$. A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains on surfaces. In this paper the conjugate function method is generalized and refined to achieve the same level of accuracy on simply and multiply connected planar domains and Riemann surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the accurate and efficient construction of the conjugate problem for multiply connected domains. The method relies on high-order finite element methods which allow for highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry containing strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments with error estimates.</description>

      <title>CLINN: Conservation Law Informed Neural Network for Approximating Discontinuous Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) faces significant challenges when approximating solutions to conservation laws, particularly in ensuring conservation and accurately resolving discontinuities. To address these limitations, we propose Conservation Law-informed Neural Network (CLINN), a novel framework that incorporates the boundedness constraint, implicit solution form, and Rankine-Hugoniot condition of scalar conservation laws into the loss function, thereby enforcing exact conservation properties. Furthermore, we integrate a residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) strategy to dynamically prioritize training near discontinuities, substantially improving the network's ability to capture sharp gradients. Numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark problems, including the inviscid Burgers equation, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic flow model, and the Buckley-Leverett problem. Results demonstrate that CLINN achieves superior accuracy in resolving solution profiles and discontinuity locations while reducing numeral oscillations. Compared to conventional PINN, CLINN yields a maximum reduction of 99.2% in mean squared error (MSE).</description>

      <title>High-Order Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws Using Young Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop high-order numerical schemes to solve random hyperbolic conservation laws using linear programming. The proposed schemes are high-order extensions of the existing first-order scheme introduced in [{\sc S. Chu, M. Herty, M. Luk\'a\v{c}ov\'a-Medvi{\softd}ov\'a, and Y. Zhou}, solving random hyperbolic conservation laws using linear programming], where a novel structure-preserving numerical method using a concept of generalized, measure-valued solutions to solve random hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is proposed, yielding a linear partial differential equation concerning the Young measure and allowing the computation of approximations based on linear programming problems. The second-order extension is obtained using piecewise linear reconstructions of the one-sided point values of the unknowns. The fifth-order scheme is developed using the finite-difference alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework. These extensions significantly improve the resolution of discontinuities, as demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments on both random (Burgers equation, isentropic Euler equations) and deterministic (discontinuous flux, pressureless gas dynamics, Burgers equation with non-atomic support) hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Achieving wavenumber robustness in domain decomposition for heterogeneous Helmholtz equation: an overview of spectral coarse spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving time-harmonic wave propagation problems in the frequency domain within heterogeneous media poses significant mathematical and computational challenges, particularly in the high-frequency regime. Among the available numerical approaches, domain decomposition methods are widely regarded as effective due to their suitability for parallel computing and their capacity to maintain robustness with respect to physical parameters, such as the wavenumber. These methods can achieve near-constant time-to-solution as the wavenumber increases, though often at the expense of a computationally intensive coarse correction step. This work focuses on identifying the best algorithms and numerical strategies for benchmark problems modelled by the Helmholtz equation. Specifically, we examine and compare several coarse spaces which are part of different families, e.g. GenEO (Generalised Eigenvalue Overlap) type coarse spaces and harmonic coarse spaces, that underpin two-level domain decomposition methods. By leveraging spectral information and multiscale approaches, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of these coarse spaces depends on the specific problem and numerical configuration, highlighting the trade-offs between computational cost, robustness, and practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an Unfitted Space-Time Finite Element method for the scalar transport equation posed on moving domains. We consider the case of the domain boundary being transported by the same velocity field as the scalar concentration inside the physical domain. A standard continuous Galerkin Finite element space is considered on a fixed background mesh, as well as tensor product Space-Time elements, which can be discontinuous along time slice boundaries. For the computational geometry, we opt for a spatially second-order accurate approximation variant in the mathematical analysis. In particular, we establish stability in a problem-specific norm and prove a priori error bounds of high order. Numerical examples illustrate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Paving the way to a $\operatorname{T}$-coercive method for the wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a first step toward introducing a space-time transformation operator $\operatorname{T}$ that establishes $\operatorname{T}$-coercivity for the weak variational formulation of the wave equation in space and time on bounded Lipschitz domains. As a model problem, we study the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $u'' + \mu u = f$ for $\mu&gt;0$, which is linked to the wave equation via a Fourier expansion in space. For its weak formulation, we introduce a transformation operator $\operatorname{T}_\mu$ that establishes $\operatorname{T}_\mu$-coercivity of the bilinear form yielding an unconditionally stable Galerkin-Bubnov formulation with error estimates independent of $\mu$. The novelty of the current approach is the explicit dependence of the transformation on $\mu$ which, when extended to the framework of partial differential equations, yields an operator acting in both time and space. We pay particular attention to keeping the trial space as a standard Sobolev space, simplifying the error analysis, while only the test space is modified. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Correction of weighted and shifted seven-step BDF for parabolic equations with nonsmooth data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the seven-step backward difference formula (BDF) is unstable for the parabolic equations, since it is not even zero-stable. However, a linear combination of two non zero-stable schemes, namely the seven-step BDF and its shifted counterpart, can yield $A(\alpha)$ stable. Based on this observation, the authors [Akrivis, Chen, and Yu, IMA J. Numer. Anal., DOI:10.1093/imanum/drae089] propose the weighted and shifted seven-step BDF methods for the parabolic equations, which stability regions are larger than the standard BDF. Nonetheless, this approach is not directly applicable for the parabolic equations with nonsmooth data, which may suffer from severe order reduction. This motivates us to design proper correction time-stepping schemes to restore the desired $k$th-order convergence rate of the $k$-step weighted and shifted BDF ($k\leq 7$) convolution quadrature for the parabolic problems. We prove that the desired $k$th-order convergence can be recovered even if the source term is discontinuous and the initial value is nonsmooth data. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage PDE-based image processing techniques for noisy MRI scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising and image segmentation play essential roles in image processing. Partial differential equations (PDE)-based methods have proven to show reliable results when incorporated in both denoising and segmentation of images. In our work, we discuss a multi-stage PDE-based image processing approach. It relies upon the nonlinear diffusion for noise removal and clustering and region growing for segmentation. In the first stage of the approach, the raw image is computed from noisy measurement data. The second stage aims to filter out the noise using anisotropic diffusion. We couple these stages into one optimisation problem which allows us to incorporate a diffusion coefficient based on a presegmented image. The third stage performs the final segmentation of the image. We demonstrate our approach on both images for which the ground truth is known and on MR measurements made by an experimental, inexpensive scanner.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) Framework for Non-linear Finite Element/Meshfree Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) tailored for nonlinear finite element and meshfree analysis. Building upon the structured foundation of HiDeNN, which includes the evaluation of shape function derivatives, adaptivity, and material derivatives, C-HiDeNN introduces a convolution operator to enhance the HiDeNN approximation. A distinctive feature of C-HiDeNN is its expanded set of optimization parameters, such as the polynomial order 'p,' dilation parameter 'a,' patch size 's,' and nodal position 'X'. These parameters function as the weights and biases within the C-HiDeNN patch. In addition, C-HiDeNN can be prescribed in regions where high resolution is desired to adaptively improve prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we provide numerical examples in the context of nonlinear finite element and meshfree analysis. The results show that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to the standard Finite Element Method (FEM) while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

Abstract: We consider boundary value problems with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives of order $s\in (1, 2)$ with non-constant diffusion and reaction coefficients. A variational formulation is derived and analyzed leading to the well-posedness of the continuous problem and its Finite Element discretization. Then, the Reduced Basis Method through a greedy algorithm for parametric diffusion and reaction coefficients is analyzed. Its convergence properties, and in particular the decay of the Kolmogorov $n$-width, are seen to depend on the fractional order $s$. Finally, numerical results confirming our findings are presented.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical approach to characterize high-frequency three-dimensional wave propagation through clamp-on flowmeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation analysis at high frequencies is essential for applications involving ultrasound waves, such as clamp-on ultrasonic flowmeters. However, it is extremely challenging to perform a 3D transient analysis of a clamp-on flowmeter using standard tools such as finite element analysis (FEA) due to the enormous associated computational cost. In this study, we separate the clamp-on flowmeter into different domains and analyze them separately. Wave propagation in the fluid domain is analyzed via FEA at low frequencies (100 kHz, 200 kHz, and 500 kHz) and using ray tracing at high frequencies (1 MHz). The behavior in the solid domain (wedges and pipe wall) is analytically characterized via geometric projection. All these individual analyses provide us with different scaling factors with which the waves in the respective domains scale when 3D effects are considered. The complete clamp-on system is then analyzed in 2D via the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to obtain the response at the receiver. The receiving signal is then scaled using the aforementioned scaling factors to accurately capture the wave propagation behavior of the clamp-on system in 3D. The output signal from the 2D analysis then becomes much clearer so that the fluid signal can be identified straightforwardly, which would be nearly impossible otherwise.</description>

      <title>Large time-step discretisation of adiabatic quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a general framework for preparing eigenstates of Hamiltonians on quantum devices. However, its digital implementation requires an efficient Hamiltonian simulation subroutine, which may introduce extra computational overhead or complicated quantum control logic. In this work, we show that the time step sizes in time discretization can be much larger than expected, and the overall complexity is greatly reduced. Remarkably, regardless of the general convergence order of the numerical method, we can choose a uniform time step size independent of tolerated error and evolution time for sufficiently accurate simulation. Furthermore, with the boundary cancellation condition where the continuous diabatic errors are exponentially suppressed, we provide strong evidence on an exponential convergence of even first-order Trotter with uniform time step size. We apply our analysis to the example of adiabatic unstructured search and show several preferable features of the Trotterized adiabatic approach: it can match the Grover lower bound, it does not require a priori knowledge on the number of marked states, and its performance can be asymptotically comparable with that of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Kernel manifolds: nonlinear-augmentation dimensionality reduction using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper generalizes recent advances on quadratic manifold (QM) dimensionality reduction by developing kernel methods-based nonlinear-augmentation dimensionality reduction. QMs, and more generally feature map-based nonlinear corrections, augment linear dimensionality reduction with a nonlinear correction term in the reconstruction map to overcome approximation accuracy limitations of purely linear approaches. While feature map-based approaches typically learn a least-squares optimal polynomial correction term, we generalize this approach by learning an optimal nonlinear correction from a user-defined reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our approach allows one to impose arbitrary nonlinear structure on the correction term, including polynomial structure, and includes feature map and radial basis function-based corrections as special cases. Furthermore, our method has relatively low training cost and has monotonically decreasing error as the latent space dimension increases. We compare our approach to proper orthogonal decomposition and several recent QM approaches on data from several example problems.</description>

      <title>The Nondecreasing Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article the notion of the nondecreasing (ND) rank of a matrix or tensor is introduced. A tensor has an ND rank of r if it can be represented as a sum of r outer products of vectors, with each vector satisfying a monotonicity constraint. It is shown that for certain poset orderings finding an ND factorization of rank $r$ is equivalent to finding a nonnegative rank-r factorization of a transformed tensor. However, not every tensor that is monotonic has a finite ND rank. Theory is developed describing the properties of the ND rank, including typical, maximum, and border ND ranks. Highlighted also are the special settings where a matrix or tensor has an ND rank of one or two. As a means of finding low ND rank approximations to a data tensor we introduce a variant of the hierarchical alternating least squares algorithm. Low ND rank factorizations are found and interpreted for two datasets concerning the weight of pigs and a mental health survey during the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of optimization problems characterized by a weighted finite-sum objective function subject to box constraints is considered. We propose a novel stochastic optimization method, named AS-BOX (\text{A}ddi\-ti\-onal \text{S}ampling for \text{BOX} constraints), that combines projected gradient directions with adaptive variable sample size strategies and nonmonotone line search. The method dynamically adjusts the batch size based on progress with respect to the additional sampling function and on structural consistency of the projected direction, enabling practical adaptivity of AS-BOX, while ensuring theoretical support. We establish almost sure convergence under standard assumptions and provide complexity bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and competitiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock exchange potential is fundamental for capturing quantum mechanical exchange effects but faces critical challenges in large-scale applications due to its nonlocal and computationally intensive nature. This study introduces a generalized framework for constructing approximate Fock exchange operators in Hartree-Fock theory, addressing the computational bottlenecks caused by the nonlocal nature. By employing low-rank decomposition and incorporating adjustable variables, the proposed method ensures high accuracy for occupied orbitals while maintaining Hermiticity and structural consistency with the exact Fock exchange operator. Meanwhile, a two-level nested self-consistent field iteration strategy is developed to decouple the exchange operator stabilization (outer loop) and electron density refinement (inner loop), significantly reducing computational costs. Numerical experiments on several molecules demonstrate that the approximate exchange operators achieve near-identical energies compared to that of the exact exchange operator and the NWChem references, with substantial improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Active-Set Identification in Noisy and Stochastic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying active constraints from a point near an optimal solution is important both theoretically and practically in constrained continuous optimization, as it can help identify optimal Lagrange multipliers and essentially reduces an inequality-constrained problem to an equality-constrained one. Traditional active-set identification guarantees have been proved under assumptions of smoothness and constraint qualifications, and assume exact function and derivative values. This work extends these results to settings when both objective and constraint function and derivative values have deterministic or stochastic noise. Two strategies are proposed that, under mild conditions, are proved to identify the active set of a local minimizer correctly when a point is close enough to the local minimizer and the noise is sufficiently small. Guarantees are also stated for the use of active-set identification strategies within a stochastic algorithm. We demonstrate our findings with two simple illustrative examples and a more realistic constrained neural-network training task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise constant control approximation provides a practical framework for designing numerical schemes of continuous-time control problems. We analyze the accuracy of such approximations for extended mean field control (MFC) problems, where the dynamics and costs depend on the joint distribution of states and controls. For linear-convex extended MFC problems, we show that the optimal control is $1/2$-H\"older continuous in time. Using this regularity, we prove that the optimal cost of the continuous-time problem can be approximated by piecewise constant controls with order $1/2$, while the optimal control itself can be approximated with order $1/4$. For general extended MFC problems, we further show that, under sufficient regularity of the value functions, the value functions converge with an improved first-order rate, matching the best-known rate for classical control problems without mean field interaction, and consistent with the numerical observations for MFC of Cucker-Smale models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Universal Approximation Theorems: Algorithmic Uniform Approximation by Neural Networks Trained with Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its core, machine learning seeks to train models that reliably generalize beyond noisy observations; however, the theoretical vacuum in which state-of-the-art universal approximation theorems (UATs) operate isolates them from this goal, as they assume noiseless data and allow network parameters to be chosen freely, independent of algorithmic realism. This paper bridges that gap by introducing an architecture-specific randomized training algorithm that constructs a uniform approximator from $N$ noisy training samples on the $d$-dimensional cube $[0,1]^d$. Our trained neural networks attain the minimax-optimal quantity of \textit{trainable} (non-random) parameters, subject to logarithmic factors which vanish under the idealized noiseless sampling assumed in classical UATs.
  Additionally, our trained models replicate key behaviours of real-world neural networks, absent in standard UAT constructions, by: (1) exhibiting sub-linear parametric complexity when fine-tuning on structurally related and favourable out-of-distribution tasks, (2) exactly interpolating the training data, and (3) maintaining reasonable Lipschitz regularity (after the initial clustering attention layer). These properties bring state-of-the-art UATs closer to practical machine learning, shifting the central open question from algorithmic implementability with noisy samples to whether stochastic gradient descent can achieve comparable guarantees.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-Guided Design of Interpolation Schedules in Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This observation motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift fields rather than statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, our optimized schedules achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla" DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla" DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks -- advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations -- show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency. Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.</description>

      <title>Notes on Simplifying the Construction of Barabanov Norms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To answer the question about the growth rate of matrix products, the concepts of joint and generalized spectral radius were introduced in the 1960s. A common tool for finding the joint/generalized spectral radius is the so-called extremal norms and, in particular, the Barabanov norm. The goal of this paper is to try to combine the advantages of different approaches based on the concept of extremality in order to obtain results that are simpler for everyday use. It is shown how the Dranishnikov-Konyagin theorem on the existence of a special invariant body for a set of matrices can be used to construct a Barabanov norm. A modified max-relaxation algorithm for constructing Barabanov norms, which follows from this theorem, is described. Additional techniques are also described that simplify the construction of Barabanov norms under the assumption that</description>

      <title>Bryne: sustainable prototyping of finite element models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source simulation frameworks are evolving rapidly to provide accessible tools for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Modern finite element (FEM) software such as FEniCS, Firedrake, or dune-fem alleviates the need for modelers to recode the discretization and linear solver backend for each application and enables rapid prototyping of solvers. However, while it has become easier to build prototype FEM models, creating a solver reusable beyond its specific initial simulation setup remains difficult. Moreover, simulation setups typically cover an ample input parameter space, and tracking complex metadata on research project time scales has become a challenge. This implies the need to supplement model development with a coding-intensive complementary workstream, seldom developed for sustainable reuse. To address these issues, we introduce our open-source Python package Bryne. Bryne is an object-oriented framework for FEM solvers built with the dune-fem Python API. In this article, we describe how it helps to evolve rapid-prototyping solver development into sustainable simulation building. First, we show how to translate a minimal dune-fem solver into a Bryne FEM model to build human-readable, metadata-enriched simulations. Bryne then offers a simulation driver and model coupling interfaces to combine implemented solvers in operator-split multiphysics simulations. The resulting reproducibility-enabled infrastructure allows users to tackle complex simulation setups without sacrificing backend flexibility. We demonstrate the workflow on a convection-coupled phase-change simulation, where a discontinuous Galerkin flow solver is coupled with a solver for solidification phase change.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Approximation Rates for Deep Super ReLU Networks on Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10766v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces deep super ReLU networks (DSRNs) as a method for approximating functions in Sobolev spaces measured by Sobolev norms $W^{m,p}$ for $m\in\mathbb{N}$ with $m\ge 2$ and $1\le p\le +\infty$. Standard ReLU deep neural networks (ReLU DNNs) cannot achieve this goal. DSRNs consist primarily of ReLU DNNs, and several layers of the square of ReLU added at the end to smooth the networks output. This approach retains the advantages of ReLU DNNs, leading to the straightforward training. The paper also proves the optimality of DSRNs by estimating the VC-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs, and obtains the generalization error in Sobolev spaces via an estimate of the pseudo-dimension of higher-order derivatives of DNNs.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Approximation of the Fractional Porous Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a finite element method for the numerical solution of a fractional porous medium equation on a bounded open Lipschitz polytopal domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $d = 2$ or $3$. The pressure in the model is defined as the solution of a fractional Poisson equation, involving the fractional Neumann Laplacian in terms of its spectral definition. We perform a rigorous passage to the limit as the spatial and temporal discretization parameters tend to zero and show that a subsequence of the sequence of finite element approximations defined by the proposed numerical method converges to a bounded and nonnegative weak solution of the initial-boundary-value problem under consideration. This result can be therefore viewed as a constructive proof of the existence of a nonnegative, energy-dissipative, weak solution to the initial-boundary-value problem for the fractional porous medium equation under consideration, based on the Neumann Laplacian. The convergence proof relies on results concerning the finite element approximation of the spectral fractional Laplacian and compactness techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations, together with properties of the equation, which are shown to be inherited by the numerical method. We also prove that the total energy associated with the problem under consideration exhibits exponential decay in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops and discusses a residual-based a posteriori error estimator for parabolic surface partial differential equations on closed stationary surfaces. The full discretization uses the surface finite element method in space and the backward Euler method in time. The proposed error indicator bounds the error quantities globally in space from above and below, and globally in time from above and locally from below. Based on the derived error indicator, a space-time adaptive algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments illustrate and complement the theory.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of a finite-volume scheme for a stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to address the convergence study of a time and space approximation scheme for an Allen-Cahn problem with constraint and perturbed by a multiplicative noise of It\^o type. The problem is set in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d=2$ or $3$) and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are considered. The employed strategy consists in building a numerical scheme on a regularized version \`a la Moreau-Yosida of the constrained problem, and passing to the limit simultaneously with respect to the regularization parameter and the time and space steps, denoted respectively by $\epsilon$, $\Delta t$ and $h$. Combining a semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama time discretization with a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme for the spatial variable, one is able to prove, under the assumption $\Delta t=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2+\theta})$ for a positive $\theta$, the convergence of such a $(\epsilon, \Delta t, h)$ scheme towards the unique weak solution of the initial problem, \textit{ a priori} strongly in $L^2(\Omega;L^2(0,T;L^2(\Lambda)))$ and \textit{a posteriori} also strongly in $L^{p}(0,T; L^2(\Omega\times \Lambda))$ for any finite $p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa of a Quadratic Matrix Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on parameters and a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa over the set of permissible parameter values is discussed, with applications in damping optimization and brake squeal reductions in mind. An approach is introduced that is based on nonsmooth and global optimization (or smooth optimization techniques such as BFGS if there are many parameters) equipped with a globally convergent criss-cross algorithm to compute the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa objective when the matrix polynomial is of small size. For the setting when the matrix polynomial is large, a subspace framework is introduced, and it is argued formally that it solves the minimization problem globally. The subspace framework restricts the parameter-dependent matrix polynomial to small subspaces, and thus solves the minimization problem for such restricted small matrix polynomials. It then expands the subspaces using the minimizers for the restricted polynomials. The proposed approach makes the global minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa possible for a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on a few parameters and for sizes up to at least a few hundreds. This is illustrated on several examples originating from damping optimization.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for Schr{\"o}dinger operators discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish guaranteed and practically computable a posteriori error bounds for source problems and eigenvalue problems involving linear Schr{\"o}dinger operators with atom-centered potentials discretized with linear combinations of atomic orbitals. We show that the energy norm of the discretization error can be estimated by the dual energy norm of the residual, that further decomposes into atomic contributions, characterizing the error localized on atoms. Moreover, we show that the practical computation of the dual norms of atomic residuals involves diagonalizing radial Schr{\"o}dinger operators which can easily be precomputed in practice. We provide numerical illustrations of the performance of such a posteriori analysis on several test cases, showing that the error bounds accurately estimate the error, and that the localized error components allow for optimized adaptive basis sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many classical and modern finite element spaces are derived by dividing each computational cell into finer pieces. Such \emph{macroelements} frequently enable the enforcement of mathematically desirable properties such as divergence-free conditions or $C^1$ continuity in a simpler or more efficient manner than elements without the subdivision. Although a few modern software projects provide one-off support for particular macroelements, a general approach facilitating broad-based support has, until now, been lacking. In this work, we describe a major addition to the FIAT project to support a wide range of different macroelements. These enhancements have been integrated into the Firedrake code stack. We provide numerical evaluation of the new macroelement facility.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an unfitted Nitsche finite element method with a new ghost-penalty stabilization based on local projection of the solution gradient. The proposed ghost-penalty operator is straightforward to implement, ensures algebraic stability, provides an implicit extension of the solution beyond the physical domain, and stabilizes the numerical method for problems dominated by transport phenomena. This paper presents both a sharp interface version of the method and an alternative diffuse interface formulation designed to avoid integration over implicitly defined embedded surfaces. A complete numerical analysis of the sharp interface version is provided. The results of several numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis and illustrate the performance of both variants of the method.</description>

Abstract: Obtaining the inverse of a large symmetric positive definite matrix $\mathcal{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is a continual challenge across many mathematical disciplines. The computational complexity associated with direct methods can be prohibitively expensive, making it infeasible to compute the inverse. In this paper, we present a novel iterative algorithm (IBMI), which is designed to approximate the inverse of a large, dense, symmetric positive definite matrix. The matrix is first partitioned into blocks, and an iterative process using block matrix inversion is repeated until the matrix approximation reaches a satisfactory level of accuracy. We demonstrate that the two-block, non-overlapping approach converges for any positive definite matrix, while numerical results provide strong evidence that the multi-block, overlapping approach also converges for such matrices.</description>

Abstract: We prove optimal error bounds for a second order in time finite element approximation of curve shortening flow in possibly higher codimension. In addition, we introduce a second order in time method for curve diffusion. Both schemes are based on variational formulations of strictly parabolic systems of partial differential equations that feature a tangential velocity which under discretization is beneficial for the mesh quality. In each time step only two linear systems need to be solved. Numerical experiments demonstrate second order convergence as well as asymptotic equidistribution.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose the Residual-Weighted Physics-Informed Neural Network (RW-PINN), a new method designed to enhance the accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based algorithms. We construct a deep learning framework with two residual-weighting schemes to solve reaction diffusion equations and evaluate its performance on both forward and inverse problems. The approach computes weights proportional to the PDE residuals, rescales them, and incorporates these scaled residuals into the loss function, leading to more stable training. Furthermore, we establish generalized error bounds that account for training and quadrature errors, and we analyze the convergence and stability of the method. The proposed algorithms are validated through numerical experiments on nonlinear equations, supported by statistical error analysis. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we implemented PINN-based forward and inverse frameworks for the nonlinear equations and conducted a comparative analysis with the proposed RW-PINN approach.</description>

      <title>A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</description>

      <title>Local Feature Filtering for Scalable and Well-Conditioned Domain-Decomposed Random Feature Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random Feature Methods (RFMs) and their variants such as extreme learning machine finite-basis physics-informed neural networks (ELM-FBPINNs) offer a scalable approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using localized, overlapping and randomly initialized neural network basis functions to approximate the PDE solution and training them to minimize PDE residuals through solving structured least-squares problems. This combination leverages the approximation power of randomized neural networks and the parallelism of domain decomposition. However, the resulting least-squares systems are often severely ill-conditioned, due to local redundancy among random basis functions, which significantly affects the convergence of standard solvers. In this work, we introduce a block rank-revealing QR (RRQR) filtering and preconditioning strategy that operates directly on the structured least-squares problem. First, local RRQR factorizations identify and remove redundant basis functions while preserving numerically informative ones, reducing problem size, and improving conditioning. Second, we use these factorizations to construct a right preconditioner for the global problem which preserves block-sparsity and numerical stability. Third, we derive deterministic bounds of the condition number of the preconditioned system, with probabilistic refinements for small overlaps. We validate our approach on challenging, multi-scale PDE problems in 1D, 2D, and (2+1)D, demonstrating reductions in condition numbers by up to eleven orders of magnitude, LSQR convergence speedups by factors of 10-1000, and higher accuracy than both unpreconditioned and additive Schwarz-preconditioned baselines, all at significantly lower memory and computational cost. These results establish RRQR-based preconditioning as a scalable, accurate, and efficient enhancement for RFM-based PDE solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing obstacle in the use of machine-learnt surrogates with larger PDE systems is the onset of instabilities when solved numerically. Efforts towards ameliorating these have mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy of the surrogates or imbuing them with additional structure, and have garnered limited success. In this article, we study a prototype problem and draw insights that can help with more complex systems. In particular, we focus on a viscous Burgers'-ML system and, after identifying the cause of the instabilities, prescribe strategies to stabilize the coupled system. To improve the accuracy of the stabilized system, we next explore methods based on the Mori--Zwanzig formalism.</description>

      <title>An approximation theory for Markov chain compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the compression of reversible Markov chains with rigorous error control. Given a subset of selected states, we construct reduced dynamics that can be lifted to an approximation of the full dynamics, and we prove simple spectral and nuclear norm bounds on the recovery error in terms of a suitably interpreted Nystr\"{o}m approximation error. We introduce two compression schemes: a projective compression based on committor functions and a structure-preserving compression defined in terms of an induced Markov chain over the selected states. The Nystr\"{o}m error appearing in our bounds can be controlled using recent results on column subset selection by nuclear maximization. Numerical experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Second-order unconditionally stable time-filtered scheme for Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the time filtering technique to develop several innovative semi-discrete schemes in time for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system. These schemes achieve second-order temporal accuracy while maintaining unconditional energy stability. Our approach begins with the discretization of the CHNS system using the first-order semi-implicit method. Subsequently, by applying time filtering techniques, we improve the temporal accuracy from first-order to second-order. This improvement requires only minor modifications to the original first-order semi-implicit scheme, thereby enabling higher accuracy to be achieved at minimal cost. Moreover, we rigorously establish the unconditional energy stability of the proposed schemes through theoretical analysis. Additionally, we extend our work to develop semi-discrete schemes that incorporate variable and adaptive time-stepping strategies, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of simulations. Numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Structure Preserving Finite Volume Schemes on Voronoi Grids: Curl Involution, Asymptotic Limit and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new curl-free and thermodynamically compatible finite volume scheme on Voronoi grids to solve compressible heat conducting flows written in first-order hyperbolic form. The approach is based on the definition of compatible discrete curl-grad operators, exploiting the triangular nature of the dual mesh. We design a cell solver reminiscent of the nodal solvers used in Lagrangian schemes to discretize the evolution equation for the thermal impulse vector, and we demonstrate that the resulting numerical scheme ensures energy conservation, local non-negative entropy production, as well as asymptotic consistency with the classical Fourier law in the stiff relaxation limit. A novel technique is proposed to transfer residuals from the dual to the primal mesh as subfluxes, which eventually yields the construction of entropy compatible semi-discrete methods. The scheme and its properties are validated on a set of numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>Basis construction for polynomial spline spaces over arbitrary T-meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first method for constructing bases for polynomial spline spaces over an arbitrary T-meshes (PT-splines for short). We construct spline basis functions for an arbitrary T-mesh by first converting the T-mesh into a diagonalizable one via edge extension, ensuring a stable dimension of the spline space. Basis functions over the diagoalizable T-mesh are constructed according to the three components in the dimension formula corresponding to cross-cuts, rays, and T $l$-edges in the diagonalizable T-mesh, and each component is assigned some local tensor product B-splines as the basis functions. We prove this set of functions constitutes a basis for the diagonalizable T-mesh. To remove redundant edges from extension, we introduce a technique, termed Extended Edge Elimination (EEE) to construct a basis for an arbitrary T-mesh while reducing structural constraints and unnecessary refinements. The resulting PT-spline basis ensures linear independence and completeness, supported by a dedicated construction algorithm. A comparison with LR B-splines, which may lack linear independence and are limited to LR-meshes, highlights the PT-spline's versatility across any T-mesh. Examples are also provided to demonstrate that dimensional instability in spline spaces is related with basis function degradation and that PT-splines are advantageous over HB-splines for certain hierarchical T-meshes.</description>

      <title>A well-balanced gas-kinetic scheme with adaptive mesh refinement for shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a well-balanced gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) with space-time adaptive mesh refinement (STAMR) for the shallow water equations (SWE). While well-balanced GKS have been established on Cartesian and triangular meshes, the proposed STAMR framework utilizes arbitrary quadrilateral meshes with hanging nodes, introducing additional challenges for maintaining well-balanced properties. In addition to spatial adaptivity, temporal adaptivity is incorporated by assigning adaptive time steps to cells at different refinement levels, further enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, the numerical flux in the GKS adaptively transitions between equilibrium fluxes for smooth flows and non-equilibrium fluxes for discontinuities, providing the proposed GKS-based STAMR method with strong robustness, high accuracy, and high resolution. Standard benchmark tests and real-world case studies validate the effectiveness of the GKS-based STAMR and demonstrate its potential for interface capturing and the simulation of complex flows.</description>

      <title>Basis Construction for Spline Spaces over Arbitrary Partitions from a Dimensional Stable Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing $C^r$ basis functions for polynomial spline spaces of degree $d$ over arbitrary planar polygonal partitions, overturning the belief that basis functions cannot be constructed on dimensionally unstable meshes. We provide a comprehensive comparison of basis construction methods, classifying them as explicit, semi-explicit, and implicit. Our method, a semi-explicit construction using Extended Edge Elimination conditions, uniquely resolves all theoretical challenges in spline spaces by ensuring a complete basis. For the first time, we construct basis functions for the spline space over the Morgan-Scott partition, previously unachieved, and elucidate dimensional instability through this construction.</description>

      <title>Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that these methods respectively achieve a sample and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{\theta+2, 2\theta\}})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. For $\theta=1$, these complexities reduce to $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-3})$ and $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-4})$ respectively, which match, up to a logarithmic factor, the best-known complexities achieved by existing methods for finding an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point of unconstrained smooth stochastic optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a mesh-independent, data-driven library, chebgreen, to mathematically model one-dimensional systems, possessing an associated control parameter, and whose governing partial differential equation is unknown. The proposed method learns an Empirical Green's Function for the associated, but hidden, boundary value problem, in the form of a Rational Neural Network from which we subsequently construct a bivariate representation in a Chebyshev basis. We uncover the Green's function, at an unseen control parameter value, by interpolating the left and right singular functions within a suitable library, expressed as points on a manifold of Quasimatrices, while the associated singular values are interpolated with Lagrange polynomials.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE) of 2D Black Box Classifier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately estimating decision boundaries in black box systems is critical when ensuring safety, quality, and feasibility in real-world applications. However, existing methods iteratively refine boundary estimates by sampling in regions of uncertainty, without providing guarantees on the closeness to the decision boundary and also result in unnecessary exploration that is especially disadvantageous when evaluations are costly. This paper presents $\varepsilon$-Neighborhood Decision-Boundary Governed Estimation (EDGE), a sample efficient and function-agnostic algorithm that leverages the intermediate value theorem to estimate the location of the decision boundary of a black box binary classifier within a user-specified $\varepsilon$-neighborhood. To demonstrate applicability, a case study is presented of an electric grid stability problem with uncertain renewable power injection. Evaluations are conducted on three test functions, where it is seen that the EDGE algorithm demonstrates superior sample efficiency and better boundary approximation than adaptive sampling techniques and grid-based searches.</description>

      <title>Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</description>

      <title>Singular values of sparse random rectangular matrices: Emergence of outliers at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the random bipartite Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph $\mathbb{G}(n, m, p)$, where each edge with one vertex in $V_{1}=[n]$ and the other vertex in $V_{2} =[m]$ is connected with probability $p$, and $n=\lfloor \gamma m\rfloor$ for a constant aspect ratio $\gamma \geq 1$. It is well known that the empirical spectral measure of its centered and normalized adjacency matrix converges to the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur (MP) distribution. However, largest and smallest singular values may not converge to the right and left edges, respectively, especially when $p = o(1)$. Notably, it was proved by Dumitriu and Zhu (2024) that there are almost surely no singular value outside the compact support of the MP law when $np = \omega(\log(n))$. In this paper, we consider the critical sparsity regime where $p = b\log(n)/\sqrt{mn}$ for some constant $b&gt;0$. We quantitatively characterize the emergence of outlier singular values as follows. For explicit $b_{*}$ and $b^{*}$ as functions of $\gamma$, we prove that when $b &gt; b_{*}$, there is no outlier outside the bulk; when $b^{*}&lt; b &lt; b_{*}$, outliers are present only outside the right edge of the MP law; and when $b &lt; b^{*}$, outliers are present on both sides, all with high probability. Moreover, the locations of those outliers are precisely characterized by a function depending on the largest and smallest degree vertices of the random graph. We estimate the number of outliers as well. Our results follow the path forged by Alt, Ducatez and Knowles (2021), and can be extended to sparse random rectangular matrices with bounded entries.</description>
