      <title>On the Hull-White model with volatility smile for Valuation Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine Diffusion dynamics are frequently used for Valuation Adjustments (xVA) calculations due to their analytic tractability. However, these models cannot capture the market-implied skew and smile, which are relevant when computing xVA metrics. Hence, additional degrees of freedom are required to capture these market features. In this paper, we address this through an SDE with state-dependent coefficients. The SDE is consistent with the convex combination of a finite number of different AD dynamics. We combine Hull-White one-factor models where one model parameter is varied. We use the Randomized AD (RAnD) technique to parameterize the combination of dynamics. We refer to our SDE with state-dependent coefficients and the RAnD parametrization of the original models as the rHW model. The rHW model allows for efficient semi-analytic calibration to European swaptions through the analytic tractability of the Hull-White dynamics. We use a regression-based Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate exposures. In this setting, we demonstrate the significant effect of skew and smile on exposures and xVAs of linear and early-exercise interest rate derivatives.</description>

      <title>Robust Utility Optimization via a GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust utility optimization enables an investor to deal with market uncertainty in a structured way, with the goal of maximizing the worst-case outcome. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.</description>
