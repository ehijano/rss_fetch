      <title>Einstein Against Singularities: Analysis versus Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein identified singularities in spacetimes, such as at the Schwarzschild radius, where later relativists only find a coordinate system assigning multiple values to a single spacetime event. These differing judgments derive from differences in mathematical methods. Later relativists employ geometrical structures to correct anomalies in the coordinate systems used in analytic expressions. Einstein took the analytic expressions to be primary and the geometrical structures as mere heuristics that could be overruled if physical assumptions required it. Einstein's non-geometric methods had a firm base in the history of mathematical methods. They continued the non-geometric orientation of Christoffel, Ricci and LeviCivita. Einstein's insistence that singularities must be eliminated marked a departure from earlier tolerance of singularities. It was founded upon his longterm project of eliminating arbitrariness from fundamental physical theories. However, Einstein was willing to theorize with singularities only temporarily if they were the least arbitrary approach then available.</description>

      <title>A neo-Kantian explanation of the applicability of mathematics to physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various 'optimistic' attempts have been made to reasonably explain the undeniable effectiveness of mathematics in its application to physics. They range over retrospective, historical accounts of mathematical applicability based on pragmatic considerations, on the one side, and prospective accounts based on indispensability considerations, on the other. In view of some objections that I will raise against these accounts, I would like to propose a third alternative based on Ernst Cassirer's neo-Kantian view which can overcome these objections and embrace both pragmatic and indispensability considerations. According to this view, mathematics and physics are seen as different modes of a basic process of cognitive synthesis that are essentially applied to each other according to a priori principles of theory development inherently incorporated into scientists' minds. As emphasised by Cassirer, these principles have a constitutive role (i.e., they explain the relevant phenomena across scientific change) and a regulative role (i.e., they incorporate the ideal of unity, permanence and generality at each stage of knowledge), both of which have been captured through a functional (i.e., structural) understanding of concepts. As a particular case study, these principles shall be instantiated by invariance groups responsible for the effectiveness of applying Lie group theory to physics.</description>
