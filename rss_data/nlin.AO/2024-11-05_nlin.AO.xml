      <title>A Mexican hat dance: clustering in Ricker-potential particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics and spontaneous organization of coupled particles is a classic problem in modeling and applied mathematics. Here we examine the behavior of particles coupled by the Ricker potential, exhibiting finite local repulsion transitioning to distal attraction, leading to an energy-minimizing ``preferred distance''. When compressed by a background potential well of varying severity, these particles exhibit intricate self-organization into ``stacks" with varying sizes and positions. We examine bifurcations of these high-dimensional arrangements, yielding tantalizing glimpses into a rich dynamical zoo of behavior.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Enhancements through Delay Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems, such as biological networks, frequently display intricate rhythmic behaviors emerging from simple, small-amplitude dynamics in individual components. This study investigates how significant oscillatory signals can arise from a minimal system comprising just two interacting units, each exhibiting simple, non-oscillatory dynamics with weak individual outputs. Contrary to the assumption that large-scale oscillations require numerous units, our model demonstrates that two units, when coupled with a time delay, can produce robust and finite oscillations. Through delayed feedback, these coupled units generate amplified oscillatory packets with large amplitudes, a phenomenon relevant to various fields. Our findings emphasize the potential of this minimalistic mechanism in producing complex rhythmic outputs essential for oscillatory signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal patterns in a 2D lattice of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons induced by high-amplitude pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical results for the effects of influence by high-amplitude periodic pulse series on a network of nonlocally coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with 2D geometry of the topology. We consider the case when the pulse amplitude is larger than the amplitude of oscillations in the autonomous network for a wide range of pulse frequencies. An initial regime in the network is a spiral wave chimera. We show that the effects of external influence strongly depend on a balance between the pulse frequency and frequencies of the spectral peaks of the autonomous network. Except for the destructive role of the pulses, when they lead to loss of stability of the initial regime, we have also revealed a constructive role. We have found for the first time the emergence of a new type of multi-front spiral waves, when the wavefront represents a set of several close fronts, and the wave dynamics are significantly different from common spiral waves: neurons oscillate independently to the wave rotation, the rotation velocity is in many times less than for the common spiral wave, etc. We have also discovered several types of cluster spatiotemporal structures induced by the pulses.</description>

      <title>Condensation effects in kinetic models for consensus dynamics: finite-time blow-up and regularity aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the main properties of the solution of a Fokker-Planck equation characterized by a variable diffusion coefficient and a polynomial superlinear drift, modeling the formation of consensus in a large interacting system of individuals. The Fokker-Planck equation is derived from the kinetic description of the dynamics of a quantum particle system, and in presence of a high nonlinearity in the drift operator, mimicking the effects of the mass in the alignment forces, allows for steady states similar to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The analysis shows that the regularity of the solution is strongly linked to the degree of nonlinearity in the drift, and that finite-time blow-up of the solution can occur when the degree of nonlinearity is sufficiently high. However, the presence of diffusion prevents the solution from forming condensation after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer for Minimizing XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer (CoVeGA), an analog computing platform designed to overcome energy barriers in XY Hamiltonians through a higher-dimensional representation. Traditional gain-based solvers utilizing optical or photonic hardware typically represent each XY spin with a single complex field. These solvers often struggle with large energy barriers in complex landscapes, leading to relaxation into excited states. CoVeGA addresses these limitations by employing two complex fields to represent each XY spin and dynamically evolving the energy landscape through time-dependent annealing. Operating in a higher-dimensional space, CoVeGA bridges energy barriers in this expanded space during the continuous phase evolution, thus avoiding entrapment in local minima. We introduce several graph structures that pose challenges for XY minimization and use them to benchmark CoVeGA against single-dimension XY solvers, highlighting the benefits of higher-dimensional operation.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of generalized Langevin equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world systems exhibit ``noisy'' evolution in time; interpreting their finitely-sampled behavior as arising from continuous-time processes (in the It\^o or Stratonovich sense) has led to significant success in modeling and analysis in a wide variety of fields. Yet such interpretation hinges on a fundamental linear separation of randomness from determinism in the underlying dynamics. Here we propose some theoretical systems which resist easy and self-consistent interpretation into this well-defined class of equations, requiring an expansion of the interpretive framework. We argue that a wider class of stochastic differential equations, where evolution depends nonlinearly on a random or effectively-random quantity, may be consistently interpreted and in fact exhibit finite-time stochastic behavior in line with an equivalent It\^o process, at which point many existing numerical and analytical techniques may be used. We put forward a method for this conversion, and demonstrate its use on both a toy system and on a system of direct physical relevance: the velocity of a meso-scale particle suspended in a turbulent fluid. This work enables the theoretical and numerical examination of a wide class of mathematical models which might otherwise be oversimplified due to a lack of appropriate tools.</description>

      <title>The evolution of complexity and the transition to biochemical life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While modern physics and biology satisfactorily explain the passage from the Big Bang to the formation of Earth and the first cells to present-day life, respectively, the origins of biochemical life still remain an open question. Since life, as we know it, requires extremely long genetic polymers, any answer to the question must explain how an evolving system of polymers of ever-increasing length could come about on a planet that otherwise consisted only of small molecular building blocks. In this work, we show that, under realistic constraints, an abstract polymer model can exhibit dynamics such that attractors in the polymer population space with a higher average polymer length are also more probable. We generalize from the model and formalize the notions of complexity and evolution for chemical reaction networks with multiple attractors. The complexity of a species is defined as the minimum number of reactions needed to produce it from a set of building blocks, which in turn is used to define a measure of complexity for an attractor. A transition between attractors is considered to be a progressive evolution if the attractor with the higher probability also has a higher complexity. In an environment where only monomers are readily available, the attractor with a higher average polymer length is more complex. Thus, our abstract polymer model can exhibit progressive evolution for a range of thermodynamically plausible rate constants. We also formalize criteria for open-ended and historically-contingent evolution and explain the role of autocatalysis in obtaining them. Our work provides a basis for searching for prebiotically plausible scenarios in which long polymers can emerge and yield populations with even longer polymers.</description>

      <title>Collective motion from quantum entanglement in visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent development in purely perception based models of collective motion using perception vectors, we suggest a quantum-inspired model of collective behaviour. We investigate the alignment of self-propelled agents by introducing quantum entanglement in the perceptual states of neighboring agents within each agent's vision cone. In this framework, we propose that the force acting on active agents is proportional to the quantum expectation value of perception operator encoding perceptual dynamics that drives alignment within the flock. Additionally, we introduce two quantum mechanical measures-perception strength and perceptual energy-to characterize collective behavior. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of the entangled state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into swarm intelligence and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from entangled perceptual states.</description>
