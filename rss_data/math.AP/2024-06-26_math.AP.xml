      <title>Continuum modeling for opinion formation on a network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Abelson's model for opinion dynamics, where individuals interact if they are connected via a fixed network. Our aim is to develop a continuous description for these dynamics that captures well the global dynamics when the number of individuals grows to infinity. We aim at having a simple continuum description on which computations and comparison with the discrete dynamics are feasible. The difficulty lies in the network of connections being described through the labeling of the individuals: this makes the system not amenable to standard mean-field limits. We overcome this difficulty by introducing an evolving label-free network description. We compare the discrete model considered, and the continuum model proposed in the case of consensus dynamics, and carry out simulations for a system with three communities. Moreover, we propose extensions of the model to incorporate phenomena like creation and destruction of connections (dynamical networks), noise, and directional networks.</description>

      <title>Regularity for solutions of non-uniformly elliptic equations in non-divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Aleksandrov--Bakelman--Pucci estimate for non-uniformly elliptic equations in non-divergence form. Moreover, we investigate local behaviors of solutions of such equations by developing local boundedness and weak Harnack inequality. Here we impose an integrability assumption on ellipticity representing degeneracy or singularity, instead of specifying the particular structure of ellipticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves that the 3-D Navier-Stokes system has a unique global solution under an assumpution on the initial data. That allow the data to be arbitrarily large in the scale invariant space \dot{B}_{\infty,\infty}^{-1}, which contains all the known spaces in which there is a global solution for small data. Moreover, this result provides various examples of arbitrarily large initial data giving rise to global solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence result for a nonlinear mixed boundary value problem for the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence of solutions in parabolic Schauder space of a nonlinear mixed boundary value problem for the heat equation in a perforated domain. From a given regular open set $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ we remove a cavity $\omega\subseteq \Omega$. On the exterior boundary of $\Omega\setminus\overline{\omega}$ we prescribe a Neumann boundary condition, while on the interior boundary we set a nonlinear Robin-type condition. Under suitable assumptions on the data and by means of Leray Schauder Fixed-Point Theorem, we prove the existence of (at least) one solution $u \in C_{0}^{\frac{1+\alpha}{2}; 1+\alpha}([0,T] \times (\overline{\Omega} \setminus \omega))$.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for fractional $p(x, .)$-Laplacian Dirichlet problems with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence of solutions of the following nonhomogeneous fractional $p(x,.)$-Laplacian Dirichlet problem: \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} \Big(-\Delta_{p(x,.)}\Big)^s u (x)&amp;=f(x, u) &amp;\text { in }&amp; \Omega, u &amp;=g &amp;\text { in }&amp; \mathbb{R}^N \setminus\Omega, \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $\Big(-\Delta_{p(x,.)}\Big)^s$ is the fractional $p(x,.)$-Laplacian, $f$ is a Carath\'eodory function with suitable growth condition and $g$ is a given boundary data. The proof of our main existence results relies on the study of the fractional $p(x, \cdot)$-Poisson equation with a nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and the theory of fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponents, together with Schauder's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for a degenerate three species reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a reaction-diffusion system for three species. The nonlinearity in the system comes from an underlying chemical reaction. Our main objective is to understand the long time behaviour of solutions to this reaction-diffusion system when there are degeneracies. More precisely, we treat cases when one of the diffusion coefficients vanishes while the other two diffusion coefficients stay positive. We prove convergence to equilibrium type results. In all our results, the constants appearing in the decay estimates are explicit.</description>

      <title>Dependence on parameters of solutions for a generalized poly-Laplacian system on weighted graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mainly investigate the continuous dependence on parameters of nontrivial solutions for a generalized poly-Laplacian system on the weighted finite graph $G=(V, E)$. We firstly present an existence result of mountain pass type nontrivial solutions when the nonlinear term $F$ satisfies the super-$(p, q)$ linear growth condition which is a simple generalization of those results in [28]. Then we mainly show that the mountain pass type nontrivial solutions of the poly-Laplacian system are uniformly bounded for parameters and the concrete upper and lower bounds are given, and are continuously dependent on parameters. Similarly, we also present the existence result, the concrete upper and lower bounds, uniqueness, and dependence on parameters for the locally minimum type nontrivial solutions. Subsequently, we present an example on optimal control as an application of our results. Finally, we give a nonexistence result and some results for the corresponding scalar equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove stochastic homogenization for a class of non-convex and non-coercive first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in a finite-range of dependence environment for Hamiltonians that can be expressed by a max-min formula. We make use of the representation of the solution as a value function of a differential game to implement a game-theoretic approach to the homogenization problem.</description>

      <title>Ground states of a nonlocal variational problem and Thomas-Fermi limit for the Choquard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonnegative optimizers of a Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality $$\iint_{\mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u(x)|^p\,|u(y)|^p}{|x - y|^{N-\alpha}} dx\, dy\le C\Big(\int_{{\mathbb R}^N}|u|^2 dx\Big)^{p\theta} \Big(\int_{{\mathbb R}^N}|u|^q dx\Big)^{2p(1-\theta)/q},$$ that involves the nonlocal Riesz energy with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;N$, $p&gt;\frac{N+\alpha}{N}$, $q&gt;\frac{2Np}{N+\alpha}$ and $\theta=\frac{(N+\alpha)q-2Np}{Np(q-2)}$. For $p=2$, the equivalent problem has been studied in connection with the Keller-Segel diffusion-aggregation models in the past few decades. The general case $p\neq 2$ considered here appears in the study of Thomas-Fermi limit regime for the Choquard equations with local repulsion. We establish optimal ranges of parameters for the validity of the above interpolation inequality, discuss the existence and qualitative properties of the nonnegative maximizers, and in some special cases estimate the optimal constant. For $p=2$ it is known that the maximizers are H\"older continuous and compactly supported on a ball. We show that for $p&lt;2$ the maximizers are smooth functions supported on $\mathbb{R}^N$, while for $p&gt;2$ the maximizers consist of a characteristic function of a ball and a nonconstant nonincreasing H\"older continuous function supported on the same ball. We use these qualitative properties of the maximizers to establish the validity of the Thomas-Fermi approximations for the Choquard equations with local repulsion. The results are verified numerically with extensive examples.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$-estimates, controllability and local-well posedness for backward SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear backward parabolic SPDEs and present new a priori estimates for their weak solutions. Inspired by the seminal work of Y. Hu, J. Ma and J. Yong from 2002 on strong solutions, we establish $L^p$-estimates requiring minimal assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients, the terminal data, and the external force. To this end, we derive a new It\^{o}'s formula for the $L^p$-norm of the solution, extending the classical result in the $L^2$-setting. This formula is then used to improve further the regularity of the first component of the solution up to $L^\infty$. Additionally, we present applications such as the controllability of backward SPDEs with $L^p$-controls and a local existence result for a semilinear equation without imposing any growth condition on the nonlinear term.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Fluctuation Expansions for Nonlinear Stochastic Heat Equations in Singular Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order fluctuation expansions for stochastic heat equations (SHE) with nonlinear, non-conservative and conservative noise are obtained. These Edgeworth-type expansions describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions in suitable joint scaling regimes of small noise intensity and diverging singularity. The results include both the case of the SHE with regular and irregular diffusion coefficients. In particular, this includes the correlated Dawson-Watanabe and Dean-Kawasaki SPDEs, as well as SPDEs corresponding to the Fleming-Viot and symmetric simple exclusion processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the Einstein constraint equations for a first-order causal viscous relativistic hydrodynamic theory in the case of a conformal fluid. For such a theory, a direct application of the conformal method does not lead to a decoupling of the equations, even for constant-mean curvature initial data. We combine the conformal method applied to a background perfect fluid theory with a perturbative argument in order to obtain the result.</description>

      <title>112 years of listening to Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1910, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz delved into the enigmatic Laplace eigenvalue equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, pondering to what extent the geometry in which one solves the equation can be recovered from knowledge of the eigenvalues. This equation, foundational in physics, puzzled scholars for decades due to its complexities when seeking a solution in an arbitrarily shaped bounded domain. Lorentz, inspired by physical and musical analogies, conjectured a fundamental relationship between eigenvalues, domain volume, and dimensionality. While his conjecture initially seemed insurmountable, Hermann Weyl's groundbreaking proof in 1912 illuminated the deep connection between eigenvalues and geometric properties. Over the ensuing 112 years, mathematicians and physicists have continued to listen to Riemannian manifolds, deciphering the intricate interplay between eigenvalues and geometry. From Weyl's law to Milnor's example of isospectral non-isometric flat tori, and Mark Kac's influential work, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, uncovering spectral invariants and advancing our understanding of geometric properties discernible through eigenvalues. This article offers a comprehensive survey of these developments, catering to both novices and experts alike. By elucidating key proofs and exploring diverse research niches, we trace the evolution of eigenvalue studies, culminating in a glimpse of the future directions this rich field may take.</description>

Abstract: We derive homogenized bending shell theories starting from three dimensional nonlinear elasticity. The original three dimensional model contains three small parameters: the two homogenization scales $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^2$ of the material properties and the thickness $h$ of the shell. Depending on the asymptotic ratio of these three parameters, we obtain different asymptotic theories.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions for Two-Phase Complex Fluids with Quadratic Anchoring in Soft Matter Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a diffuse interface model describing the complex rheology and the interfacial dynamics during phase separation in a polar liquid-crystalline emulsion. More precisely, the physical systems comprises a two-phase mixture consisting in a polar liquid crystal immersed in a Newtonian fluid. Such composite material is a paradigmatic example of complex fluids arising in Soft Matter which exhibits multiscale interplay. Beyond the Ginzburg-Landau and Frank elastic energies for the concentration and the polarization, the free energy of the system is characterized by a quadratic anchoring term which tunes the orientation of the polarization at the interface. This leads to several quasi-linear nonlinear couplings in the resulting system describing the macroscopic dynamics. In this work, we establish the first mathematical results concerning the global dynamics of two-phase complex fluids with interfacial anchoring mechanism. First, we determine a set of sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions which guarantee the existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Secondly, we show that weak solutions are unique and globally regular in the two dimensional case. Finally, we complement our analysis with some numerical simulations to display polarization and interfacial anchoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational approach to approximate measures with measures uniformly distributed over a 1 dimentional set. The problem consists in minimizing a Wasserstein distance as a data term with a regularization given by the length of the support. As it is challenging to prove existence of solutions to this problem, we propose a relaxed formulation, which always admits a solution. In the sequel we show that if the ambient space is $\mathbb{R}^2$ , under techinical assumptions, any solution to the relaxed problem is a solution to the original one. Finally we manage to prove that any optimal solution to the relaxed problem, and hence also to the original, is Ahlfors regular.</description>

More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball $B_0$ and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_{B_0}$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_{B_0} \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>

Abstract: For $N\geq 4$, we let $\Omega$ be a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$ and $\Gamma$ be a closed curve contained in $\Omega$. We study existence of positive solutions $u \in H^1_0\left(\Omega\right)$ to the equation \begin{equation}\label{Atusi} -\Delta u+hu=\lambda\rho^{-s_1}_\Gamma u^{2^*_{s_1}-1}+\rho^{-s_2}_\Gamma u^{2^*_{s_2}-1} \qquad \textrm{ in } \Omega \end{equation} where $h$ is a continuous function and $\rho_\Gamma$ is the distance function to $\Gamma$. We prove the existence of a mountain pass solution for this Euler-Lagrange equation depending on the local geometry of the curve and the potential $h$.</description>

      <title>On widely degenerate \textit{p}-Laplace equations with symmetric data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Dirichlet problems with a widely degenerate equation. Through a well-known result by Talenti, we explicitly express the gradient of the solution $u_p$ outside the ball with a radius of $1$, if the datum $f$ is a non-negative radially decreasing function. This allows us to establish some sharp higher regularity results for the weak solutions, assuming that the datum $f$ belongs to a suitable Lorentz space, i.e. under a weaker assumption on the datum with respect to the available literature. Moreover we analyze the behaviour of $u_p$ as $p \to 1^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study both one and two-phase minimisers of the Dirichlet-area energy $$E(v) = \int_{B_1} \vert\nabla v\vert^2 + Per(\{v&gt;0\},B_1).$$ In the two-phase case, we show that the energies $$E_{\varepsilon}(v) = \int_{B_1}\vert\nabla v\vert^2 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}W\left(\frac{v}{\varepsilon^{1/2}}\right),$$ $\Gamma$-converge to $E$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, where $W$ is the double well potential extended by zero outside of $[-1,1]$ . As a consequence, we show that bounded local minimisers of $E_{\varepsilon}$ converge to a local minimiser of $E$.</description>

Abstract: We show by the maximum principle parabolic interior Schauder estimates for a special class of fully nonlinear parabolic Isaacs equations, providing an Evans-Krylov result for the model equation $\min\{\inf_{\beta}L_\beta u,\sup_\gamma L_\gamma u\}-\partial_t u=0$, where $L_\beta,L_\gamma$ are linear operators with possibly variable H\"older coefficients. Along the way, we provide a short survey on the regularity theory for fully nonlinear parabolic equations of second order.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for a kinetic bacterial chemotaxis model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform stability analysis of a kinetic bacterial chemotaxis model of bacterial self-organization, assuming that bacteria respond sharply to chemical signals. The resulting discontinuous tumbling kernel represents the key challenge for the stability analysis as it rules out a direct linearization of the nonlinear terms. To address this challenge we fruitfully separate the evolution of the shape of the cellular profile from its global motion. We provide a full nonlinear stability theorem in a perturbative setting when chemical degradation can be neglected. With chemical degradation we prove stability of the linearized operator. In both cases we obtain exponential relaxation to equilibrium with an explicit rate using hypocoercivity techniques. To apply a hypocoercivity approach in this setting, we develop two novel and specific approaches: i) the use of the $H^1$ norm instead of the $L^2$ norm, and ii) the treatment of nonlinear terms. This work represents an important step forward in bacterial chemotaxis modeling from a kinetic perspective as most results are currently only available for the macroscopic descriptions, which are usually parabolic in nature. Significant difficulty arises due to the lack of regularization of the kinetic transport operator as compared to the parabolic operator in the macroscopic scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of Fourier series and deep neural network for the indicator function of d-dimensional ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08172v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the crucial difference between a deep neural network and the Fourier series. For the multiple Fourier series of periodization of some radial functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, Kuratsubo (2010) investigated the behavior of the spherical partial sum and discovered the third phenomenon other than the well-known Gibbs-Wilbraham and Pinsky phenomena. In particular, the third one exhibits prevention of pointwise convergence. In contrast to it, we give a specific deep neural network and prove pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a family of self-adjoint Dirac operators $-i c (\alpha \cdot \nabla) + \frac{c^2}{2}$ subject to generalized MIT bag boundary conditions on domains in $\mathbb R^3$ it is shown that the nonrelativistic limit in the norm resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. This allows to transfer spectral geometry results for Dirichlet Laplacians to Dirac operators for large $c$.</description>
