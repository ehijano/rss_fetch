      <title>Model Checking of vGOAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing autonomous decision-making requires safety assurance. Agent programming languages like AgentSpeak and Gwendolen provide tools for programming autonomous decision-making. However, despite numerous efforts to apply model checking to these languages, challenges persist such as a faithful semantic mapping between agent programs and the generated models, efficient model generation, and efficient model checking.
  As an extension of the agent programming language GOAL, vGOAL has been proposed to formally specify autonomous decisions with an emphasis on safety. This paper tackles the mentioned challenges through two automated model-checking processes for vGOAL: one for Computation Tree Logic and another for Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic. Compared with the existing model-checking approaches of agent programming languages, it has three main advantages. First, it efficiently performs automated model-checking analysis for a given vGOAL specification, including efficiently generating input models for NuSMV and Storm and leveraging these efficient model checkers. Second, the semantic equivalence is established for both nondeterministic models and probabilistic models of vGOAL: from vGOAL to transition systems or DTMCs. Third, an algorithm is proposed for efficiently detecting errors, which is particularly useful for vGOAL specifications that describe complex scenarios. Validation and experiments in a real-world autonomous logistic system with three autonomous mobile robots illustrate both the efficiency and practical usability of the automated CTL and PCTL model-checking process for vGOAL.</description>

      <title>Learnings from Implementation of a BDI Agent-based Battery-less Wireless Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery-less embedded devices powered by energy harvesting are increasingly being used in wireless sensing applications. However, their limited and often uncertain energy availability challenges designing application programs. To examine if BDI-based agent programming can address this challenge, we used it for a real-life application involving an environmental sensor that works on energy harvested from ambient light. This yielded the first ever implementation of a BDI agent on a low-power battery-less and energy-harvesting embedded system. Furthermore, it uncovered conceptual integration challenges between embedded systems and BDI-based agent programming that, if overcome, will simplify the deployment of more autonomous systems on low-power devices with non-deterministic energy availability. Specifically, we (1) mapped essential device states to default \textit{internal} beliefs, (2) recognized and addressed the need for beliefs in general to be \textit{short-} or \textit{long-term}, and (3) propose dynamic annotation of intentions with their run-time energy impact. We show that incorporating these extensions not only simplified the programming but also improved code readability and understanding of its behavior.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Framework for Optimizing Wildfire Surveillance and Suppression using Human-Autonomous Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of manned and unmanned aircraft can help improve wildfire response. Wildfire containment failures occur when resources available to first responders, who execute the initial stages of wildfire management referred to as the initial attack, are ineffective or insufficient. Initial attack surveillance and suppression models have linked action spaces and objectives, making their optimization computationally challenging. The initial attack may be formulated as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process (MPOMDP). We divide the initial attack MPOMDP into surveillance and suppression processes with their respective planners operating on different, but constant, time scales. A hierarchical framework iterates between surveillance and suppression planners while also providing collision avoidance. This framework is exemplified by a set of multi-rotor unmanned aircraft surveying an initial attack fire while a manned helicopter suppresses the fire with a water bucket. Wildfire-specific solver extensions are formulated to reduce the otherwise vast action spaces. The hierarchical framework outperforms firefighting techniques and a myopic baseline by up to 242% for moderate wildfires and 60% for rapid wildfires when simulated in abstracted and actual case studies. We also validate the early dispatching of additional suppression assets using regression models to ensure wildfire containment to thresholds established by wildfire agencies.</description>

      <title>CuDA2: An approach for Incorporating Traitor Agents into Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (CMARL) strategies are well known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Previous works on adversarial attacks have primarily focused on white-box attacks that directly perturb the states or actions of victim agents, often in scenarios with a limited number of attacks. However, gaining complete access to victim agents in real-world environments is exceedingly difficult. To create more realistic adversarial attacks, we introduce a novel method that involves injecting traitor agents into the CMARL system. We model this problem as a Traitor Markov Decision Process (TMDP), where traitors cannot directly attack the victim agents but can influence their formation or positioning through collisions. In TMDP, traitors are trained using the same MARL algorithm as the victim agents, with their reward function set as the negative of the victim agents' reward. Despite this, the training efficiency for traitors remains low because it is challenging for them to directly associate their actions with the victim agents' rewards. To address this issue, we propose the Curiosity-Driven Adversarial Attack (CuDA2) framework. CuDA2 enhances the efficiency and aggressiveness of attacks on the specified victim agents' policies while maintaining the optimal policy invariance of the traitors. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Random Network Distillation (RND) module, where the extra reward generated by the RND module encourages traitors to explore states unencountered by the victim agents. Extensive experiments on various scenarios from SMAC demonstrate that our CuDA2 framework offers comparable or superior adversarial attack capabilities compared to other baselines.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they ignore the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as "in 50% of the cases, no one of group 1 receives the information and everyone in group 2 receives it and in other 50%, the opposite happens", which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Locally Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning with Guaranteed Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed online learning is gaining increased traction due to its unique ability to process large-scale datasets and streaming data. To address the growing public awareness and concern on privacy protection, plenty of algorithms have been proposed to enable differential privacy in distributed online optimization and learning. However, these algorithms often face the dilemma of trading learning accuracy for privacy. By exploiting the unique characteristics of online learning, this paper proposes an approach that tackles the dilemma and ensures both differential privacy and learning accuracy in distributed online learning. More specifically, while ensuring a diminishing expected instantaneous regret, the approach can simultaneously ensure a finite cumulative privacy budget, even in the infinite time horizon. To cater for the fully distributed setting, we adopt the local differential-privacy framework, which avoids the reliance on a trusted data curator, and, hence, provides stronger protection than the classic "centralized" (global) differential privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that successfully ensures both rigorous local differential privacy and learning accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using machine learning tasks, including logistic regression on the the "mushrooms" datasets and CNN-based image classification on the "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10" datasets.</description>

      <title>Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Bayesian social learning is a framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents toward a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows discovering the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>

      <title>TornadoDrone: Bio-inspired DRL-based Drone Landing on 6D Platform with Wind Force Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous drone navigation faces a critical challenge in achieving accurate landings on dynamic platforms, especially under unpredictable conditions such as wind turbulence. Our research introduces TornadoDrone, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model that adopts bio-inspired mechanisms to adapt to wind forces, mirroring the natural adaptability seen in birds. This model, unlike traditional approaches, derives its adaptability from indirect cues such as changes in position and velocity, rather than direct wind force measurements. TornadoDrone was rigorously trained in the gym-pybullet-drone simulator, which closely replicates the complexities of wind dynamics in the real world. Through extensive testing with Crazyflie 2.1 drones in both simulated and real windy conditions, TornadoDrone demonstrated a high performance in maintaining high-precision landing accuracy on moving platforms, surpassing conventional control methods such as PID controllers with Extended Kalman Filters. The study not only highlights the potential of DRL to tackle complex aerodynamic challenges but also paves the way for advanced autonomous systems that can adapt to environmental changes in real-time. The success of TornadoDrone signifies a leap forward in drone technology, particularly for critical applications such as surveillance and emergency response, where reliability and precision are paramount.</description>
