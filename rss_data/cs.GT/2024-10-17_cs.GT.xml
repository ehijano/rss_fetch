      <title>Analyzing Incentives and Fairness in Ordered Weighted Average for Facility Location Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facility location games provide an abstract model of mechanism design. In such games, a mechanism takes a profile of $n$ single-peaked preferences over an interval as an input and determines the location of a facility on the interval. In this paper, we restrict our attention to distance-based single-peaked preferences and focus on a well-known class of parameterized mechanisms called ordered weighted average methods, which is proposed by Yager in 1988 and contains several practical implementations such as the standard average and the Olympic average. We comprehensively analyze their performance in terms of both incentives and fairness. More specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on their parameters to achieve strategy-proofness, non-obvious manipulability, individual fair share, and proportional fairness, respectively.</description>

      <title>EF1 for Mixed Manna with Unequal Entitlements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fair division of indivisible mixed manna when agents have unequal entitlements, with weighted envy-freeness up to one item (WEF1) as our primary notion of fairness. We identify several shortcomings of existing techniques to achieve WEF1. Hence, we relax WEF1 to weighted envy-freeness up to 1 transfer (WEF1T), and give a polynomial-time algorithm for achieving it. We also generalize Fisher markets to the mixed manna setting, and use them to get a polynomial-time algorithm for two agents that outputs a WEF1 allocation.</description>

      <title>Truthful High Dimensional Sparse Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fitting the high dimensional sparse linear regression model with sub-Gaussian covariates and responses, where the data are provided by strategic or self-interested agents (individuals) who prioritize their privacy of data disclosure. In contrast to the classical setting, our focus is on designing mechanisms that can effectively incentivize most agents to truthfully report their data while preserving the privacy of individual reports. Simultaneously, we seek an estimator which should be close to the underlying parameter. We attempt to solve the problem by deriving a novel private estimator that has a closed-form expression. Based on the estimator, we propose a mechanism which has the following properties via some appropriate design of the computation and payment scheme: (1) the mechanism is $(o(1), O(n^{-\Omega({1})}))$-jointly differentially private, where $n$ is the number of agents; (2) it is an $o(\frac{1}{n})$-approximate Bayes Nash equilibrium for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of agents to truthfully report their data; (3) the output could achieve an error of $o(1)$ to the underlying parameter; (4) it is individually rational for a $(1-o(1))$ fraction of agents in the mechanism; (5) the payment budget required from the analyst to run the mechanism is $o(1)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on designing truthful (and privacy-preserving) mechanisms for high dimensional sparse linear regression.</description>

      <title>Contracting With a Reinforcement Learning Agent by Playing Trick or Treat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study principal-agent problems where a farsighted agent takes costly actions in an MDP. The core challenge in these settings is that agent's actions are hidden to the principal, who can only observe their outcomes, namely state transitions and their associated rewards. Thus, the principal's goal is to devise a policy that incentives the agent to take actions leading to desirable outcomes. This is accomplished by committing to a payment scheme (a.k.a. contract) at each step, specifying a monetary transfer from the principal to the agent for every possible outcome. Interestingly, we show that Markovian policies are unfit in these settings, as they do not allow to achieve the optimal principal's utility and are constitutionally intractable. Thus, accounting for history in unavoidable, and this begets considerable additional challenges compared to standard MDPs. Nevertheless, we design an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal policy, leveraging a compact way of representing histories for this purpose. Unfortunately, the policy produced by such an algorithm cannot be readily implemented, as it is only approximately incentive compatible, meaning that the agent is incentivized to take the desired actions only approximately. To fix this, we design an efficient method to make such a policy incentive compatible, by only introducing a negligible loss in principal's utility. This method can be generally applied to any approximately-incentive-compatible policy, and it generalized a related approach that has already been discovered for classical principal-agent problems to more general settings in MDPs.</description>

      <title>EFX Exists for Three Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among multiple agents. EFX, which stands for envy-freeness up to any good, is a well-studied relaxation of the envy-free allocation problem and has been shown to exist for specific scenarios. For instance, EFX is known to exist when there are only three agents [Chaudhury et al, EC 2020], and for any number of agents when there are only two types of valuations [Mahara, Discret. Appl. Math 2023].
  We show that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents when there are at most three types of additive valuations.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Game Framework for Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of game-theoretic principles combined with advanced Kalman filtering techniques to enhance maritime target tracking systems. Specifically, the paper presents a two-player, imperfect information, non-cooperative, sequential game framework for optimal decision making for a tracker and an evader. The paper also investigates the effectiveness of this game-theoretic decision making framework by comparing it with single-objective optimisation methods based on minimising tracking uncertainty. Rather than modelling a zero-sum game between the tracker and the evader, which presupposes the availability of perfect information, in this paper we model both the tracker and the evader as playing separate zero-sum games at each time step with an internal (and imperfect) model of the other player. The study defines multi-faceted winning criteria for both tracker and evader, and computes winning percentages for both by simulating their interaction for a range of speed ratios. The results indicate that game theoretic decision making improves the win percentage of the tracker compared to traditional covariance minimization procedures in all cases, regardless of the speed ratios and the actions of the evader. In the case of the evader, we find that a simpler linear escape action is most effective for the evader in most scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that the presented sequential-game based decision making framework significantly improves win percentages for a player in scenarios where that player does not have inherent advantages in terms of starting position, speed ratio, or available time (to track / escape), highlighting that game theoretic decision making is particularly useful in scenarios where winning by using more traditional decision making procedures is highly unlikely.</description>

      <title>Optimal MEV Extraction Using Absolute Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new, more potent attack on decentralized exchanges. This attack leverages absolute commitments, which are commitments that can condition on the strategies made by other agents. This attack allows an adversary to charge monopoly prices by committing to undercut those other miners that refuse to charge an even higher fee. This allows the miner to extract the maximum possible price from the user, potentially through side channels that evade the inefficiencies and fees usually incurred. This is considerably more efficient than the prevailing strategy of `sandwich attacks', wherein the adversary induces and profits from fluctuations in the market price to the detriment of users. The attack we propose can, in principle, be realized by the irrevocable and self-executing nature of smart contracts, which are readily available on many major blockchains. Thus, the attack could potentially be used against a decentralized exchange and could drastically reduce the utility of the affected exchange.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer General Lotto game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the multiplayer General Lotto game across multiple battlefields, a significant variant of the Colonel Blotto game. In this version, each player employs a probability distribution for resource allocation, ensuring that their expected expenditure does not exceed their budget. We first establish the existence of the Nash equilibrium in a general setting, where players' budgets are asymmetric and the values of the battlefields are heterogeneous and asymmetric among players. Next, we provide a detailed characterization of the Nash equilibrium for multiple players on a single battlefield. In this characterization, we observe that the upper endpoints of the supports of players' equilibrium strategies coincide, and that the minimum value of a player's support above zero inversely correlates with his budget. We demonstrate the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium over a single battlefield in some scenarios. In the multi-battlefield setting, we prove that there is an upper bound on the average number of battlefields each player participates in. Additionally, we provide an example demonstrating the non-uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the context of multiple battlefields with multiple players. Finally, we present a solution for the Nash equilibrium in a symmetric case.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of fair allocation of indivisible items with subsidies when agents have weighted entitlements. After highlighting several important differences from the unweighted case, we present several results concerning weighted envy-freeability including general characterizations, algorithms for achieving and testing weighted envy-freeability, lower and upper bounds of the amount of subsidies for envy-freeable allocations, and algorithms for achieving weighted envy-freeability along with other properties.</description>

      <title>Achieving Maximin Share and EFX/EF1 Guarantees Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing \emph{fair} divisions of a set of indivisible goods among agents with \emph{additive} valuations. For the past many decades, the literature has explored various notions of fairness, that can be primarily seen as either having \emph{envy-based} or \emph{share-based} lens. For the discrete setting of resource-allocation problems, \emph{envy-free up to any good} (EFX) and \emph{maximin share} (MMS) are widely considered as the flag-bearers of fairness notions in the above two categories, thereby capturing different aspects of fairness herein. Due to lack of existence results of these notions and the fact that a good approximation of EFX or MMS does not imply particularly strong guarantees of the other, it becomes important to understand the compatibility of EFX and MMS allocations with one another.
  In this work, we identify a novel way to simultaneously achieve MMS guarantees with EFX/EF1 notions of fairness, while beating the best known approximation factors [Chaudhury et al., 2021, Amanatidis et al., 2020]. Our main contribution is to constructively prove the existence of (i) a partial allocation that is both $2/3$-MMS and EFX, and (ii) a complete allocation that is both $2/3$-MMS and EF1. Our algorithms run in pseudo-polynomial time if the approximation factor for MMS is relaxed to $2/3-\varepsilon$ for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and in polynomial time if, in addition, the EFX (or EF1) guarantee is relaxed to $(1-\delta)$-EFX (or $(1-\delta)$-EF1) for any constant $\delta&gt;0$. In particular, we improve from the best approximation factor known prior to our work, which computes partial allocations that are $1/2$-MMS and EFX in pseudo-polynomial time [Chaudhury et al., 2021].</description>

      <title>Striking a Balance: An Optimal Mechanism Design for Heterogenous Differentially Private Data Acquisition for Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of solving machine learning tasks using data from privacy-sensitive sellers. Since the data is private, we design a data market that incentivizes sellers to provide their data in exchange for payments. Therefore our objective is to design a mechanism that optimizes a weighted combination of test loss, seller privacy, and payment, striking a balance between building a good privacy-preserving ML model and minimizing payments to the sellers. To achieve this, we first propose an approach to solve logistic regression with known heterogeneous differential privacy guarantees. Building on these results and leveraging standard mechanism design theory, we develop a two-step optimization framework. We further extend this approach to an online algorithm that handles the sequential arrival of sellers.</description>

      <title>MALADY: Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in semi-supervised cases, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) framework which leverages the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, we generalize the auction dynamics algorithm on similarity graphs for semi-supervised learning in [24] to incorporate a more general optimization functional. Moreover, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that uses the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.</description>
