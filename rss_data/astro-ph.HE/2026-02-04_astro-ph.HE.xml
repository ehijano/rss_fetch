      <title>GenASiS: General Astrophysical Simulation System. II. Self-gravitating Baryonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System) is a code being developed initially and primarily, though not exclusively, for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae on the world's leading capability supercomputers. This paper -- the second in a series -- documents capabilities for Newtonian self-gravitating fluid dynamics, including tabulated microphysical equations of state treating nuclei and nuclear matter (`baryonic matter'). Computation of the gravitational potential of a spheroid, and simulation of the gravitational collapse of dust and of an ideal fluid, provide tests of self-gravitation against known solutions. In multidimensional computations of the adiabatic collapse, bounce, and explosion of spherically symmetric pre-supernova progenitors -- which we propose become a standard benchmark for code comparisons -- we find that the explosions are prompt and remain spherically symmetric (as expected), with an average shock expansion speed and total kinetic energy that are inversely correlated with the progenitor mass at the onset of collapse and the compactness parameter.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution of Antimatter Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental question of baryogenesis and the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry motivate this study into the formation and evolution of antimatter objects in the early Universe. Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\approx 5 \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\gtrsim 22 M_{\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation. Observational constraints on the existence of these objects must rely on the detection of characteristic high-energy $\gamma$-ray or X-ray signals resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries or during mass accretion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signals for Supernova Explosions of Three-Dimensional Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f ~ 1-2000 Hz.</description>

      <title>Radiation-hydrodynamics of star-disc collisions for quasi-periodic eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recently discovered transients of unknown nature occurring near supermassive black holes, which feature bright X-ray bursts separated by hours to days. A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Modelling of 2,205 ZTF DR2 Type~Ia Supernovae: Implications for SN Ia Physics and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit the multi-band light curves of 2,205 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 with a one-zone radioactive decay model with a phenomenological addition to include Fe recombination physics. We find a strong correlation between inferred nickel mass and SALT2 stretch, which within our simplified modelling is linked to larger ejecta masses providing longer diffusion times, providing a physical basis for the brighter-slower relation. SN~Ia in low-mass hosts ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) &lt; 10$) produce $12\%$ more $^{56}$Ni than those in high-mass hosts ($\Delta M_{\rm Ni} = 0.13~M_\odot$), linking the host-galaxy mass step to ejecta properties and hinting at metallicity or age-dependent burning efficiencies. This suggests that standardisation based on physical parameters may remove the mass-step. SN~1991T-like events show higher ejecta masses (median $1.64~M_\odot$ vs. $1.38~M_\odot$ for normals) and produce $30\%$ more $^{56}$Ni, with $84\%$ having super-Chandrasekhar masses. Through Hierarchical modelling of $902$ SNe ($z \leq 0.06$), we find thermonuclear supernovae can be well described by a Gaussian distribution in ejecta mass and nickel mass with $\mu_{\rm ej} = 1.26 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm ej} = 0.33 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$) and $\mu_{\rm Ni} = 0.64 \pm 0.06~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm Ni} = 0.42 \pm 0.02~M_\odot$), respectively. This leads to inferred fractions of $43 \pm 2\%$ sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($&lt;1.2~M_\odot$), $34 \pm 1\%$ near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($1.2$--$1.5~M_\odot$), and $24 \pm 2\%$ super-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($&gt;1.5~M_\odot$) events. This work provides a step towards holistic physical characterization of the local SN~Ia population, reinforcing the physical basis of SN~Ia standardization while quantifying diversity and environmental dependencies critical for understanding progenitor physics and mitigating systematics in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>An infrared echo from a circumstellar disk in the hydrogen- and helium-poor SN 2024aecx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of the hydrogen- and helium-poor (Type Ic) supernova (SN) 2024aecx that displays a strong NIR excess emerging 32 days post peak. SN 2024aecx is a peculiar SN Ic that exhibited luminous shock-cooling emission at early times, suggestive of close-in circumstellar medium (CSM), unexpected for this class of SNe. Its early NIR spectra are typical for a SN Ic but with strong CI absorption features. By ~32 days post peak, the spectra show a strong NIR excess, while maintaining normal optical colors, unprecedented for SNe Ic. We find that the NIR excess is well fit with a single-temperature, optically thin dust model with declining temperature, increasing mass, and roughly constant luminosity over time. The NIR excess appears too promptly for dust to have formed in the SN ejecta, indicating an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the CSM. The IR echo is likely powered by the relatively slowly evolving SN peak light, and not the brief shock cooling emission, as the latter requires unrealistically high CSM densities to explain the observed dust mass. We consider different potential CSM geometries and find that a thick face-on disk with an inner edge around $5\times 10^{16}$ cm can best explain the dust mass and temperature evolution. In this scenario, the SN shock should start interacting with this CSM $440\pm200$ days post explosion. CSM around SN Ic is rare, and follow-up observations of SN 2024aecx will probe the mass-loss process responsible for removing hydrogen and helium from their progenitor star.</description>

      <title>Cyclotron lines in subcritical X-ray pulsars: Monte Carlo simulations reveal the origin of the observed variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) exhibit strong variability. In the subcritical luminosity regime, the centroid energy ($E_{CRSF}$) and line width ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) often show positive correlations with the X-ray luminosity. We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing. The CRSF is systematically redshifted relative to the classical cyclotron energy, with the magnitude of the redshift decreasing at higher luminosities and for larger viewing angles $\theta$. Both $E_{CRSF}$ and $\sigma_{CRSF}$ correlate positively with luminosity for all viewing angles. Their absolute values, however, depend strongly on the viewing angle, indicating substantial variability over the pulse cycle and sensitivity to the system geometry. At fixed luminosity, $E_{CRSF}$ ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) decreases (increases) with increasing $\cos\theta$. Consequently, phase-resolved observations are expected to reveal an anticorrelation between the CRSF centroid energy and width. When applied to the XRP GX 304$-$1, the model reproduces the observed CRSF variability over nearly an order of magnitude in luminosity for geometries in which the accretion funnel is predominantly viewed edge-on.</description>

      <title>Investigating particle acceleration in the Wolf-Rayet bubble NGC 2359</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars have been proposed as candidates to be major factories of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). However, this claim lacks enough empirical evidence, especially for isolated stars. The powerful stellar winds from massive stars impact the ambient medium producing strong shocks suitable for accelerating relativistic particles. The detection of non-thermal emission-particularly synchrotron emission in low radio frequencies-serves as a key proof of particle acceleration sites. We aim to assess the potential of isolated massive stars as sources of GCRs. We observed the Wolf-Rayet bubble, NGC 2359, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at Band 3 (250-500 MHz) and Band 4 (550-950 MHz). Additionally, we used complementary archival radio datasets at different frequencies to derive the broad spectral energy distribution (SED) for several regions within the bubble. To further characterize the interaction between the stellar wind and the ambient medium, we introduced a composite SED model including synchrotron and free-free emission, and two low-frequency turnover processes, the Razin-Tsytovich (RT) effect and free-free absorption (FFA).We used a Bayesian inference approach to fit the SEDs and constrain the electron number density and magnetic field strength. The SEDs of several regions reveal spectral indices steeper than -0.5, indicative of synchrotron emission. and show a turnover below ~1 GHz. Our SED modelling suggests that the observed turnover is primarily caused by the RT effect, with a minor contribution from internal FFA. Our analysis confirms the presence of synchrotron radiation within NGC 2359. This is the second detection of non-thermal emission in a stellar bubble surrounding a WR star, reinforcing the idea that such environments are sites of relativistic particle acceleration and supporting the hypothesis that isolated massive stars are sources of GCRs of at least GeV energies.</description>

      <title>How Distance Affects GRB Prompt Emission Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated how Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission measurements are affected by increasing distance to the source. We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z&lt;1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the ``tip-of-the-iceberg'' effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z&gt;3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\sim$several tens ($\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect.</description>

      <title>Long-term timing evolution of four Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be manifestations of magnetars. Typically, AXPs exhibit higher X-ray luminosities, whereas SGRs are generally fainter and display significantly high signal-to-noise ratios only during their outburst phases. In this work, we report the long-term timing evolution of four AXPs: 1E 2259+586, 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, which were regularly monitored with NICER from 2017 to 2024. Over this period, we identify a total of 10 timing events. In addition to one glitch and one anti-glitch in 1E 2259+586 reported in literature, we detect another 8 new timing events: 5 glitches, 2 anti-glitches, and 1 unusual state transition event. Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event. Finally, we study the evolution of the pulse profiles and find that the profiles of 1E 2259+586 and 4U 0142+61 both evolve. This is consistent with the earlier finding that pulse profile evolution is a generic feature of magnetars.</description>

      <title>The orbital parameters of gamma-ray binary PSR~J2032+4127</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR~J2032+4127 is the only one of gamma-ray binary, that exhibits pulsations in gamma-ray. Previous research has indicated that the pulsar and the Be star MT91 213 orbit each other in a highly eccentric orbit with an extremely long period, with the pulsar reaching its periastron on November 13, 2017. Since its launch, the \fermi{} satellite has been monitoring this pulsar for 16 years, covering the 8 years before and the 8 years after the pulsar passed its periastron. Using these data, we present an analysis of pulse arrival times, and precisely determine the orbital parameters for the first time: the orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} \sim 52.3$ yr, the eccentricity of $e \sim 0.98$, the semimajor axis of $a$sin$i \sim 25.3$ AU, and the orbital inclination of $\sim$ 47.1$^\circ$ -- 55.1$^\circ$. We also reveal another small glitch occurred in 2021, MJD $\sim$ 59500.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024igg, another ``super-Chandrasekhar'' (or 03fg-like) SN whose strong C II $\lambda6580$ feature was initially misidentified as H$\alpha$, thereby constraining its progenitor system, explosion parameters, and physical scenario. SN 2024igg shows many characteristics in common with other 03fg-like objects, such as high ultraviolet flux, slowly declining light curves ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=0.90\pm0.08$ mag), low expansion velocities, along with strong and persistent C II absorption. Meanwhile, this SN exhibits some remarkable properties within this subgroup, including a moderately low optical luminosity ($M_{\rm max}(B)=-18.99\pm0.15$ mag), a short rise time less than 18.5 days, and strong C II $\lambda6580$. The bolometric analysis yields a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm Ni}=0.547\pm0.082$ $M_{\rm \odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $1.54^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$, marginally exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass. Our TARDIS result indicates that most of the features in the earliest spectrum could be attributed to C II, which is consistent with a model where a supernova explodes within a carbon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction would produce a density peak in the ejecta, offering a natural explanation for the slowly evolving line velocities near $-$8000 km s$^{-1}$. The CSM may stem from the debris of a secondary white dwarf in a white-dwarf merger or the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch star. Combined with the unshifted forbidden lines in the spectrum taken at $t\approx\ +$135 days, we suggest that SN 2024igg comes from a symmetric explosion on a secular timescale after the merger.</description>

      <title>Shells and bubbles around compact clusters of massive stars: 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A case for Case A: detailed look at binary black hole formation through stable mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\odot$ and $2Z_\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z&gt;0.2Z_\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\chi_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of charged Bardeen black holes in perfect fluid dark matter with a cloud of strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.</description>

      <title>The favoured twin: on the dynamical response of twin stars to perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a strong first-order phase transition takes place at sufficiently high rest-mass densities in the equation of state (EOS) modelling compact stars, a new branch will appear in the mass-radius sequence of stable equilibria. This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent ``twin-star'' solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the ``favoured'' one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature.</description>

      <title>The ubiquitous flavor pendulum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system of classical interacting spins can develop collective instabilities which, in the nonlinear regime, mimic the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum. Known as the flavor pendulum, this behavior appears among the collective modes of a dense neutrino plasma after a strong reduction of phase space through symmetry assumptions. It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hyperon Skyrme Forces in Multi-$\Lambda$ Hypernuclei and Neutron Star Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major source of uncertainty in modeling the strangeness-rich interiors of neutron stars arises from the poorly constrained two-body and three-body interactions among hyperons and nucleons. We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\Lambda N$ interaction parameters within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework, constrained by both hypernuclei experimental data and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the parameter space of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction is tightly constrained by combining nuclear and astrophysical data, while the parameters of the $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body interaction remain sensitive to astrophysical inputs alone. Specifically, the local, momentum-independent two-body interaction parameter $\lambda_0$ is tightly constrained and predominantly attractive, while the momentum-dependent parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ contribute repulsive effects at high densities. A key role is played by the $\Lambda\Lambda$ potential depth in pure $\Lambda$ matter, which effectively constrains the two-body $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction and governs the balance between attraction at low densities and repulsion at high densities. The repulsive components of $\Lambda\Lambda$ interactions then decrease hyperon fractions and reconcile hyperon-rich equations of state with the observed $\sim2\,M_{\odot}$ neutron stars, increasing the maximum mass by up to 22\%. The inclusion of $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body forces further stiffens the EOS, raising the maximum mass by up to $\sim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$. Our study represents a promising step toward a complete, experimentally grounded description of dense matter across a wide range of densities and strangeness compositions.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae: III. Supernovae and their environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.</description>

      <title>Light-Curve and Spectral Properties of Type II Supernovae from the ATLAS survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\odot$ within $90\%$ confidence interval, respectively.</description>

      <title>Photometry and Spectroscopy of SN 2024pxl: A Luminosity Link Among Type Iax Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present extensive ultraviolet to optical photometric and optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up observations of the nearby intermediate-luminosity ($M_V = -16.81\pm0.19$~mag) Type Iax supernova (SN) 2024pxl in NGC 6384. SN~2024pxl exhibits a faster light curve than the high-luminosity members of this class, and slower than low-luminosity events. The observationally well-constrained rise time of $\sim$11 days and an estimated synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.03\, M$_\odot$, based on analytical modeling of the integrated spectral energy distribution light curve, are consistent with models of the weak deflagration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Our optical spectral sequence of SN~2024pxl shows weak \ion{Si}{2} lines and spectral evolution similar to other high-luminosity Type Iax SNe, but also a prominent early-time \ion{C}{2} line, like lower-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The late-time optical spectrum of SN~2024pxl closely matches that of SN~2014dt, and its NIR spectral evolution aligns with that of other well-studied, high-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The spectral-line expansion velocities of SN~2024pxl are at the lower end of the Type Iax SN velocity distribution, and the velocity distribution of iron-group elements compared to intermediate-mass elements suggests that the ejecta are mixed on large scales, as expected in pure deflagration models. SN~2024pxl exhibits characteristics intermediate between those of high-luminosity and low-luminosity Type~Iax SNe, further establishing a link across this diverse class.</description>

      <title>$\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of a number of proton-rich isotopes in the solar system has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. While recent studies have analyzed several relevant physical effects that influence the efficiency of this process, the impact of General Relativity (GR) on it remains unexplored. We perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated $\nu p$-process yields in Newtonian and fully GR calculations, using detailed models of time-evolving outflow profiles. The GR effects are seen to suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the resulting $p$-nuclide abundances. Our reference GR model, with an 18~$M_\odot$ progenitor, reproduces both the relative and absolute solar system abundances of the entire set of the $p$ nuclides in the mass range $74\leq A\leq102$. The yields are suboptimal in our 12.75~$M_\odot$ GR model, where the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, suppressing further $p$-nuclide production. In both models, most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes occurs relatively early, 1--3 seconds after shock revival. In contrast, a large fraction of the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$ is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In summary, with the GR effects taken into account, the $\nu p$-process in a sufficiently massive progenitor can provide a unifying explanation for the origin of all $p$ nuclei in the solar system up to $^{102}$Pd.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13933v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron Merit Factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$, $X_{\mathrm{max}}+R+L$, or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain additional latent composition-sensitive features beyond what is available in $X_{\mathrm{max}}$, $R$, and $L$, which should be resolvable in real events.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $\sim 10$ Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 1000$ binaries can have highly eccentric, librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT. This work increases the measurements of frequency scaling index of scatter-broadening ($\alpha$) across the nebula by more than 3 times. A strong correlation between the distance and the scattering strength is observed for pulsars behind the nebula. It is also observed that for distant pulsars ($&gt; 2 kpc$), the effect of the Gum nebula in DM and scattering strength is not substantial. We also report a much flatter $\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.</description>

      <title>The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future LISA mission. We present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We numerically model the stripping of the brown dwarf envelope and the subsequent accretion of this material. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Blazar PKS 0446+11 -- Neutrino connection study using a lepto-hadronic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of a blazar PKS 0446+11, motivated by its spatial association with the neutrino event IC240105A detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory on 2024 January 5. The source is located 0.4 degrees from the best-fit neutrino direction and satisfies selection criteria for VLBI-selected, radio-bright AGN that have been identified as highly probable neutrino associations. PKS 0446+11 exhibited a major gamma-ray flare in November 2023, reaching approximately 18x its 4FGL-DR4 catalog average. Around the neutrino epoch, PKS 0446+11 remained in an elevated state, with the gamma-ray flux more than six times above its catalog level, the X-ray flux an order of magnitude above the archival measurements, and the optical-UV emission also enhanced. We used Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and archival multi-wavelength data to construct multi-wavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). SED modeling shows that the emission is best described by a leptonic scenario, with synchrotron emission at low energies and external Compton scattering of broad-line region and dusty torus photons dominating the X-ray - gamma-ray output. A lepto-hadronic model fails to adequately reproduce the observed SED, although hadronic cascades can broadly account for the X-ray and gamma-ray spectral coverage at lower flux levels. We compute the expected neutrino flux for the hadronic scenario and compare it to the IceCube 90% upper limit. Our results highlight the importance of continued multi-wavelength and neutrino monitoring to better understand the physical conditions under which this blazar may serve as neutrino source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain one of the most puzzling astrophysical phenomena. While most FRBs are detected only once or sporadically, we present the identification of FRB 20190520B as the first persistently active source over a continuous span of ~ four years. This rare long-term activity enabled a detailed investigation of its dispersion measure (DM) evolution. We also report that FRB 20190520B exhibits a substantial decrease in DM at a global rate of minus 12.4 plus or minus 0.3 pc cm^-3 yr^-1, exceeding previous FRB DM variation measurements by a factor of three and surpassing those observed in pulsars by orders of magnitude. The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).</description>

Abstract: We present a new non-relativistic reflection model, DAO, designed to calculate reflection spectra in the rest frame of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The model couples the XSTAR code, which treats atomic processes, with the Feautrier method for solving the radiative transfer equation. A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering. Furthermore, the model accommodates arbitrary illuminating spectra, enabling applications across diverse physical conditions. We investigate the spectral dependence on key physical parameters and benchmark the results against the widely used reflionx and xillver codes.</description>

      <title>Projected sensitivity of CTAO to axion-like particles from blazars with a machine learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes located at the centres of distant galaxies characterised by strong emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we estimate the potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to constrain the ALP parameter space by simulating observations of two bright blazars, Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304. We obtain projected $2\sigma$ exclusion regions, demonstrating that CTAO will be able to consistently improve present limits thanks to its greater energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. In addition to the standard statistical technique based on the likelihood ratio test, we further demonstrate the application of a new method based on machine learning classifiers, which may help in reducing the effect of systematic model-dependent uncertainties in future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</title>

Abstract: We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Accretion flow around Kerr metric in the infra-red limit of asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the azimuthal asymmetry of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter effectively reduces the strength of gravitational focusing by modifying the metric coefficients in the strong-field region, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>

Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulation of Odd Radio Circles as Merger-Driven Shocks in Galaxy Groups</title>

Abstract: Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</title>

Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</description>

      <title>Solitary Alfv\'en Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the solitary Alfv\'en wave, an exact nonlinear solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, and construct a three-dimensional numerical model -- an \emph{Alfv\'enon}. The model is characterized by an unperturbed far field, quasi-constant $|\boldsymbol{B}|$, and open field-line topology. Direct MHD simulations of the Alfv\'enon demonstrate remarkable stability, confirming that it behaves as a nonlinear solitary Alfv\'enic solution under ideal MHD evolution.</description>
