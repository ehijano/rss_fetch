      <title>Fredholm anomalies on manifold with corners of low codimensions and conormal corner cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected manifold with corners $X$ of any codimension there is a very basic and computable homology theory called conormal homology defined in terms of faces and orientations of their conormal bundles, and whose cycles correspond geometrically to corner's cycles, these conormal homology groups are denoted by $H^{cn}_*(X)$. Using our previous works we define an index morphism $$K^0(^bT^*X)\stackrel{Ind_{ev,cn}^X}{\longrightarrow}H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$$ for $X$ a manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three and called here the even conormal index morphism. In the case that $X$ is compact and connected and $D$ is an elliptic $b-$pseudodifferential operator in the associated $b-$calculus of $X$ we know, by our previous works and other authors works, that, up to adding an identity operator, $D$ can be perturbed (with a regularizing operator in the calculus) to a Fredholm operator iff $Ind_{ev,cn}^X([\sigma_D])$ (where $[\sigma_D]\in K^0(^bT^*X)$ is the principal symbol class) vanishes in the even conormal homology group $H_{ev}^{cn}(X)$. The main result of this paper is the explicit computation of the even and odd conormal index morphisms $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\sigma)\in H_{ev/odd}^{cn}(X)$ for $X$ a manifold with corners of codimension less or equal to three. The coefficients of the conormal corner cycles $Ind_{ev/odd,cn}^X(\sigma)$ are given in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Singer indices of the maximal codimension faces of $X$ and in terms of some suspended Atiyah-Patodi-Singer indices of the non-maximal codimension faces of $X$. As a corollary we give a complete caracterization to the obstruction of the Fredholm perturbation property for closed manifolds with corners of codimension less or equal to three in terms of the above mentioned indices of the faces, this allows us as well to give such a characterization in terms of the respective topological indices.</description>

      <title>Thomason filtration via $T(1)$-local $\mathrm{TC}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a natural filtration on $T(1)$-local $\mathrm{TC}$ for any animated commutative rings using prismatic cohomology and descent theory. In the course of the construction, we also study some general properties of prismatic cohomology complexes over perfect prisms after inverting distinguished generators. The construction is intrinsic to $\mathrm{TC}$ and recovers Thomason's spectral sequence for $T(1)$-local algebraic K-theory via the cyclotomic trace map; as a consequence, we also recover the \'etale comparison for prismatic cohomology.</description>
