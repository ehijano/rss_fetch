      <title>Structural Decomposition of Merger-Free Galaxies Hosting Luminous AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nucleus (AGN) growth in disk-dominated, merger-free galaxies is poorly understood, largely due to the difficulty in disentangling the AGN emission from that of the host galaxy. By carefully separating this emission, we examine the differences between AGNs in galaxies hosting a (possibly) merger-grown, classical bulge, and AGNs in secularly grown, truly bulgeless disk galaxies. We use GALFIT to obtain robust, accurate morphologies of 100 disk-dominated galaxies imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope. Adopting an inclusive definition of classical bulges, we detect a classical bulge component in $53.3 \pm 0.5$ per cent of the galaxies. These bulges were not visible in Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry, however these galaxies are still unambiguously disk-dominated, with an average bulge-to-total luminosity ratio of $0.1 \pm 0.1$. We find some correlation between bulge mass and black hole mass for disk-dominated galaxies, though this correlation is significantly weaker in comparison to the relation for bulge-dominated or elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, a significant fraction ($\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of our black holes are overly massive when compared to the relationship for elliptical galaxies. We find a weak correlation between total stellar mass and black hole mass for the disk-dominated galaxies, hinting that the stochasticity of black hole-galaxy co-evolution may be higher disk-dominated than bulge-dominated systems.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Star Formation Enhancement and Suppression in Gas-rich Galaxy Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy interactions can significantly affect the star formation in galaxies, but it remains a challenge to achieve a consensus on the star formation rate (SFR) enhancement in galaxy pairs. Here, we investigate the SFR enhancement of gas-rich galaxy pairs detected by the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY). We construct a sample of 278 paired galaxies spanning a stellar mass ($M_\ast$) range from $10^{7.6}$ to $10^{11.2}M_\odot$. We obtain individual masses of atomic hydrogen (HI) for these paired galaxies, using a novel deblending algorithm for HI data cubes. Quantifying the interaction stages and strengths with parameters motivated by first principles, we find that at fixed stellar and HI mass, the alteration in SFR of galaxy pairs starts when their dark matter halos encounter. For galaxies with stellar mass lower than $10^9M_\odot$, their SFRs show tentative suppression of 1.4 sigma after the halo encounter, and then become enhanced when their HI disks overlap, regardless of mass ratios. In contrast, the SFRs of galaxies with $M_\ast &gt; 10^9M_\odot$ increase monotonically toward smaller projected distances and radial velocity offsets. When a close companion is present, a pronounced SFR enhancement is found for the most HI-poor high-mass galaxies in our sample. Collecting the observational evidence, we provide a coherent picture of the evolution of galaxy pairs, and discuss how the tidal effects and hydrodynamic processes shape the SFR enhancement. Our results provide a coherent picture of gas-rich galaxy interactions and impose constraints on the underlying physical processes.</description>

      <title>Direct-method metallicity gradients derived from spectral stacking with SDSS-IV MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundances are key tracers of the cycle of baryons driving the evolution of galaxies. Most measurements of interstellar medium (ISM) abundance and metallicity gradients in galaxies are based, however, on model-dependent strong-line methods. Direct chemical abundances can be obtained via the detection of weak auroral lines, but such lines are too faint to be detected across large spectroscopic surveys of the local Universe. In this work we overcome this limitation and obtain metallicity gradients from direct method abundances by stacking spectra from the MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey. In particular we stack 4140 star-forming galaxies across the star formation rate-stellar mass (SFR-M$_\star$) plane and across six radial bins. We calculate electron temperatures for [OII], [SII], [NII], [SIII] and [OIII] across the majority of stacks. We find that the T[OII] $\sim$ T[SII] $\sim$ T[OII], as expected since these ions all trace the low-ionization zone of nebulae. The [OIII] temperatures become substantially larger than those of other ions at high metallicity, indicating potentially unaccounted for spectral contamination or additional physics. In light of this uncertainty we base our abundance calculation on the temperatures of [SIII] and the low-ionization ions. We recover a mass-metallicity relation (MZR) similar to that obtained with different empirical calibrations. We do not find evidence, however, for a secondary dependence on SFR using direct metallicities. Finally, we derive metallicity gradients that becomes steeper with stellar mass for $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) &lt; 10.5$. At higher masses, the gradients flatten again, confirming with auroral line determinations the trends previously defined with strong-line calibrators.</description>

      <title>Understanding Density Fluctuations in Supersonic, Isothermal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersonic turbulence occurs in many environments, particularly in astrophysics. In the crucial case of isothermal turbulence, the probability density function (PDF) of the logarithmic density, $s$, is well measured, but a theoretical understanding of the processes leading to this distribution remains elusive. We investigate these processes using Lagrangian tracer particles to track $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ in direct numerical simulations, and we show that their evolution can be modeled as a stochastic differential process with time-correlated noise. The temporal correlation functions of $s$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ decay exponentially, as predicted by the model, and the decay timescale is $\approx$ 1/6 the eddy turnover time. The behavior of the conditional averages of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$ is also well explained by the model, which shows that the density PDF arises from a balance between stochastic compressions/expansions, which tend to broaden the PDF, and the acceleration/deceleration of shocks by density gradients, which tends to narrow it.</description>

      <title>ERGO-ML: A continuous organization of the X-ray galaxy cluster population in TNG-Cluster with contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) reflect signatures of the underlying gravitational potential, mergers and strong interactions with other halos and satellite galaxies, as well as galactic feedback from supernovae and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Traditionally, clusters have been characterized in terms of summary statistics, such as halo mass, X-ray luminosity, cool-core state, luminosity of AGN, and number of merging components. In this paper of the Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning series (ERGO-ML), we instead consider the full information content available in maps of X-ray emission from the ICM. We employ Nearest Neighbour Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to identify and populate a low-dimensional representation space of such images. Using idealized X-ray maps of the 352 clusters of the TNG-Cluster cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulation suite, we take three orthogonal projections of each cluster at eight snapshots within the redshift range $0\leq z&lt;1$, resulting in a dataset of $\sim$8,000 images. Our findings reveal that this representation space forms a continuous distribution from relaxed to merging objects, and from centrally-peaked to flat emission profiles. The representation also exhibits clear trends with redshift, with halo, gas, stellar, and SMBH mass, with time since a last major merger, and with indicators of dynamical state. We show that an 8-dimensional representation can be used to predict a variety of cluster properties, find analogs, and identify correlations between physical properties, thereby suggesting causal relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that contrastive learning is a powerful tool for characterizing galaxy clusters from their images alone, allowing us to derive constraints on their physical properties and formation histories using cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy simulations.</description>

      <title>RR Lyrae stars trace the Milky Way warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outskirts of the Milky Way disc have been known to be warped since the late 1950s. Although various stellar populations have shown an underlying warped distribution, the relation between the age of the population and the warp they trace remains an open question. Our goal in this work is to detect the presence of the warp in the RR Lyrae (RRL) population of the Galactic disc. We use a compilation of public catalogues of RRL stars, precise photometric distances ($\sim 5\%$) and Gaia DR3 proper motions to kinematically select a sample of thin disc RRL in the Galactic anticentre, where the tangential velocity best approximates the azimuthal velocity to differentiate between disc and halo. For disc-like RRL we analyse their mean vertical height and mean vertical velocity. We show, for the first time, that RRL stars with thin disc-like kinematics trace the warp. In the anticentre direction, the RRL population reaches a minimum in mean vertical height of $\approx 0.4$ kpc, with a trend systematically lower than the one found with Classical Cepheids. The kinematical signal of the RRL warp starts at $R\approx 10$ kpc and, rather than resembling the Cepheid's, shows a similar trend to the Red Clump population from previous works, reaching a maximum value of $\approx 7$ km/s in vertical velocity. We also obtain an estimation of the pattern speed of the RRL warp with a prograde rotation of $\approx 13 \pm 2 $ km/s/kpc, compatible with results obtained from Cepheids. Finally, we obtain a vertical velocity dispersion $\approx 17 $km/s, inconsistent with the kinematics of a canonical old age ($&gt; 10$ Gyr) disc population and, instead, favouring a population dominated by intermediate-age ($3-4$ Gyr). Our results indicate that the thin disc RRL stars are a dynamical intermediate-age tracer of the warp, opening a new window to study the dependency of the warp with stellar age.</description>

      <title>How black hole activity may influence exoplanetary evolution in our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of exoplanets have been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, which is also known to harbour a super-massive black hole (Sagittarius A*) at its centre. Here, we investigate how the central black hole (BH) activity may affect the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Accreting BHs emit high-energy radiation -- extreme ultraviolet and X-rays -- which can lead to XUV photoevaporation of the planetary atmospheres. We evaluate the atmospheric mass-loss using both theoretical estimates of the BH radiative output and observational constraints on the past activity history of Sgr A*. The resulting mass-loss is analysed as a function of the galactocentric distance. For the first time, we compute the exoplanet atmospheric evolution under BH irradiation by explicitly including the temporal evolution of the central luminosity output (i.e. the BH activity history). We obtain that Sgr A* could have a major impact on exoplanets located in the inner region of the Galaxy (e.g. Galactic bulge): a significant fraction of the atmospheric mass can be removed by BH irradiation; and in extreme cases, the initial atmosphere may be completely stripped away. Such mass-loss can have important consequences on the atmospheric chemistry and potential biological evolution. We discuss the physical implications for planetary habitability, and we also briefly consider the case of stellar-mass BHs. Overall, accreting black holes may play a significant role in the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>First results from the JWST Early Release Science Program Q3D: AGN photoionization and shock4 ionization in a red quasar at z = 0.45</title>

Abstract: Red quasars, often associated with potent [OIII] outflows on both galactic and circumgalactic scales, may play a pivotal role in galactic evolution and black hole feedback. In this work, we explore the [FeII] emission in one such quasar at redshift z = 0.4352, F2M J110648.32+480712.3, using the integral field unit (IFU) mode of the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our observations reveal clumpy [FeII] gas located to the south of the quasar. By comparing the kinematics of [FeII] and [OIII], we find that the clumpy [FeII] gas in the southeast and southwest aligns with the outflow, exhibiting similar median velocities up to v_50 ~ 1200 km/s and high velocity widths W_80 &gt; 1000 km/s. In contrast, the [FeII] gas to the south shows kinematics inconsistent with the outflow, with W_80 ~ 500 km/s, significantly smaller than the [OIII] at the same location, suggesting that the [FeII] may be confined within the host galaxy. Utilizing standard emission-line diagnostic ratios, we map the ionization sources of the gas. According to the MAPPINGS III shock models for [FeII]/Pabeta, the regions to the southwest and southeast of the quasar are primarily photoionized. Conversely, the [FeII] emission to the south is likely excited by shocks generated by the back-pressure of the outflow on the galaxy disk, a direct signature of the impact of the quasar on its host.</description>

      <title>Abundance ties: Nephele and the globular cluster population accreted with {\omega} Cen. Based on APOGEE DR17 and Gaia EDR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar Galactic globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri (NGC 5139) has drawn attention for its unique features - such as a high stellar mass and a broad distribution of chemical elements - that have led to the hypothesis that it might be the nuclear remnant of an ancient dwarf galaxy accreted by the Milky Way (MW), potentially bringing along its own globular cluster (GC) system. In this work, we adopt an innovative approach by examining the individual chemical abundances of Galactic GCs. Applying Gaussian Mixture Models to globular cluster stars, whose membership is based on Gaia EDR3, and whose chemical abundances are provided by APOGEE DR17, we depart from traditional kinematic-based procedures and search for GCs that are chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen in a 8-dimensional space defined by [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [C/Fe], [Al/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Mn/Fe]. Our analysis leads to the identification of six GCs - NGC 6752, NGC 6656, NGC 6809, NGC 6273, NGC 6205, and NGC 6254 - that exhibit strong chemical similarities with $\omega$ Cen, and which have metallicities that coincide with those of the two main peaks of $\omega$ Cen's metallicity distribution. The chemical patterns of these clusters lead to the exclusion that they formed in progenitor galaxies with chemical enrichment histories similar to those of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, Sagittarius, and Fornax. Once placed in kinematic spaces such as the energy - angular momentum plane, these GCs result scattered across an extended region, which is predicted by N-body simulations if their common progenitor was sufficiently massive compared to the MW. Our novel approach suggests a common origin for NGC 6752, NGC 6656, NGC 6809, NGC 6273, NGC 6205, NGC 6254 and $\omega$ Cen, indicating that Nephele, as we propose to call the progenitor in which these GCs formed, played a substantial role in the Galaxy's history.</description>

      <title>The Dust Extinction Curve: Beyond R(V)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dust extinction curve is typically parameterized by a single variable, R(V), in optical and near-infrared wavelengths. R(V) controls the slope of the extinction-vs.-wavelength curve, and is thought to reflect the grain-size distribution and composition of dust. Low-resolution, flux-calibrated BP/RP spectra from Gaia have allowed the determination of the extinction curve along sightlines to 130 million stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We show that these extinction curves contain more than a single degree of freedom - that is, that they are not simply described by R(V). We identify a number of components that are orthogonal to R(V) variation, and show that these components vary across the sky in coherent patterns that resemble interstellar medium structure. These components encode variation in the 770 nm extinction feature, intermediate-scale and very broad structure, and a newly identified feature at 850 nm, and likely trace both dust composition and local conditions in the interstellar medium. Correlations of the 770 nm and 850 nm features with R(V) suggest that their carriers become more abundant as the carrier of the 2175 Angstrom feature is destroyed. Our 24 million extinction-curve decompositions and feature equivalent-width measurements are publicly available at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14005028.</description>

      <title>Supernova Shocks in Molecular Clouds: Shocks Driven into Dense Cores in IC 443 and 3C 391</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova shocks into dense molecular cores in IC 443 (clumps B, C, and G) and 3C 391 were observed using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy and complemented by archival data from the Herschel Space Observatory. The pure rotational transitions 0-0 S(1) and S(5) of H2, and the ground-state 110-101 transition of H2O, are all broadened, arising from molecules that survive the passage of the shock front. Theoretical models from the Paris-Durham shock code were analyzed to generate synthetic profiles that approximately match the observations. The observations can be fit with two shock conditions, which approximate the range of densities in the pre-shock molecular cloud. The width and brightness of the S(5) lines require shocks into gas with a density of order 2,000 cm-3, into which the IC 443 blast wave drives shocks with speed 60 km/s. The brightness and narrower width of the S(1) lines requires different shocks, into gas with density of order 10^5 cm-3, with shock speeds of 10 km/s. The H2O velocity distribution is also consistent with these shocks. The existence of shocks into dense gas shows that the bright shocked clumps in IC~443 were prestellar cores. It is unlikely that they will form stars soon after the passage of the shock front, given the input of kinetic and thermal energy from the shocks.</description>

      <title>Discovering Changing-Look AGN in the 6dF Galaxy Survey using ATLAS Light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei (CLAGN) are characterised by extreme variations in line emission over short timescales, mostly affecting broad H$\beta$ lines. While a few hundred CLAGN are known, a complete sample of turn-on CLAGN is still elusive. Here, we present a search for turn-on CLAGN in a complete sample of galaxies, using archival spectra and recent light curves. We obtained light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) for 16,232 emission line galaxies, including both star-forming and active galaxies, at $z&lt;0.1$ with spectra from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). We first establish typical variability behaviour for different AGN types, as recorded between 2001 and 2009, and then select outliers from the bulk behaviour as CLAGN candidates. We obtain new spectra for the candidates and identify 12 new turn-on CLAGN (appearing broad H$\beta$ line) and 19 new turn-off CLAGN (disappearing broad H$\beta$ line). We may have missed AGN that changed and reverted their state over the 15$-$20 years since 6dFGS spectra were taken, and thus our CLAGN rates of 1.7$\%$ for turn-on and 9.6$\%$ for turn-off are lower limits. The turn-on rate is naturally much lower as the type 1.9/2 sample is dominated by obscured AGN due to orientation, which are not expected to change. However, the number of turn-on (27) and turn-off (24) CLAGN we find are similar, suggesting that our parent AGN sample is reasonably complete in our search volume at $z&lt;0.1$.</description>

      <title>Future prospects for measuring 1PPN parameters using observations of S2 and S62 at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism offers an agnostic framework for evaluating theories of gravity that extend beyond General Relativity. Departures from General Relativity are represented by a set of dimensionless parameters that, at the first order in the expansion, reduce to $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which describe deviations in spatial curvature and non-linear superposition effects of gravity, respectively. We exploit future observations of stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of astrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric, simulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital precession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since future data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future observations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky to Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight constraints on the parameter $\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of the astrometric deviations due to lensing. When combining lensing observations for S62, and the precise orbital tracking of S2, one obtains independent constraints on both $\gamma$ (with a potential precision as good as $\sim 1\%$) and $\beta$ (with a corresponding precision of $\sim 2\%$), providing a precision test of General Relativity and its extensions.</description>

      <title>C-19 and Hot, Wide, Star Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C-19 star stream has the abundance characteristics of an unusually metal poor globular cluster but kinematically is uncharacteristically hot and wide for a cluster stream, having a line of sight velocity dispersion of 6 \kms\ and a 1-sigma width of 240 pc. We show that the tidal dissolution of an old, lower mass, globular cluster in a CDM galactic halo naturally creates a hot, wide stream currently near orbital apocenter. More generally, simulations show that hot streams, which are all near their orbital apocenter, become thin, cool streams near pericenter. Furthermore, the wide streams from a population of dissolved clusters in the simulations have a mean galactocentric radial velocity dispersion of 7.8$\pm$1.0 \kms\ in a CDM cosmology but only 4.1$\pm$1.6 \kms\ in a WDM (5.5 keV) simulation. A detailed C-19 model in a simplified Milky Way halo potential with a CDM subhalo population provides a lower bound to stream heating, finding that the stream develops a line of sight velocity dispersion of 4.1$\pm$1.1 \kms, whereas WDM (5.5 keV) subhalos give 3.1$\pm$0.1\kms. Known dwarf galaxies alone provide negligible heating. There are five other currently known streams wider than 200 pc that contain a globular cluster, all near their orbital apocenter.</description>

      <title>Massive star evolution models incorporating $\alpha$-enhanced composition -- I. BPASS Single star models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar evolution modelling is fundamental to many areas of astrophysics including stellar populations in both nearby and distant galaxies. It is heavily influenced by chemical composition. Observations of distant galaxies and nucleosynthesis calculations show that $\alpha$-process elements are enriched faster than iron group elements. We present a dense grid of single-star models calculated using the BPASS stellar evolution code and covering masses ($0.1\le\mathrm{M/M}_\odot\le316$), metallicity mass fractions ($10^{-5} \le Z \le 0.04$) and $\alpha$-to-iron abundance ratios ($-0.2\le[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]\le+0.6$). By comparing Solar-scaled models to ones enriched in $\alpha$-process elements, we find that stellar radii, surface temperatures, Main Sequence lifetimes, supernova progenitor properties and supernova rates are all sensitive to changes in [$\alpha$/Fe]. Lifetimes of low-mass stars differ by up to 0.4 dex, while surface temperatures of massive stars at the end of the Main Sequence also differ by around 0.4 dex. Inferred supernova rates when [Fe/H] is unknown can be highly uncertain. Models with different [$\alpha$/Fe] but comparable iron abundances show smaller variations, indicating that while iron primarily defines the course of evolution; $\alpha$-enhancement nonetheless has an impact of up to 0.1 dex on stellar properties. Such changes are small for individual stars, but have a large cumulative effect when considering an entire stellar population as demonstrated by isochrone fitting to nearby clusters. Changes in radii and lifetimes have further consequences for a stellar population including binary stars, as they influence the timing, nature and occurrence rate of mass transfer events.</description>

      <title>Dust extinction-curve variation in the translucent interstellar medium is driven by PAH growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first all-sky, high-resolution, 3D map of the optical extinction curve of the Milky Way (Zhang &amp; Green 2024) revealed an unexpected steepening of the extinction curve in the moderate-density, "translucent" interstellar medium (ISM). We argue that this trend is driven by growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through gas-phase accretion. We find a strong anti-correlation between the slope of the optical extinction curve -- parameterized by $R(V)$ -- and maps of PAH abundance -- parameterized by $q_{\rm PAH}$ -- derived from infrared emission. The range of observed $q_{\rm PAH}$ indicates PAH growth by a factor of $\sim$2 between $A_V \simeq 1$ and 3. This implies a factor-of-two stronger 2175 Angstrom feature, which is sufficient to lower $R(V)$ by the observed amount. This level of PAH growth is possible given rapid accretion timescales and the depletion of carbon in the translucent ISM. Spectral observations by JWST would provide a definitive test of this proposed explanation of $R(V)$ variation.</description>

      <title>Burstiness in low stellar-mass Ha emitters at z~2 and z~4-6 from JWST medium band photometry in GOODS-S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a sample of 4500 photometrically-selected Ha emitter galaxies at redshifts z~2 and z~4-6 selected from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) medium-band images in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S). The bulk (80%) of the galaxies in our sample have stellar masses lower than 10^8 Msun, with a median stellar mass of ~10^7.3 Msun. We derive Ha rest-frame equivalent widths ( EW0(Ha) ), line fluxes, and star formation rates using a robust photometric excess technique tested against spectroscopic measurements, being sensitive to EW0(Ha) &gt; 75 A. Both EW0(Ha) and sSFR(Ha) anti-correlate with stellar mass, and at fixed stellar mass, show a steep increasing trend with redshift sSFR(Ha) ~ (1+z)^2.55. By comparing the Ha and rest-frame UV-derived SFRs, we probe the star formation histories (SFHs) of our galaxies in the past 100 Myr. The fraction of low-mass galaxies (M &lt; 10^8 Msun) with signs of bursty star formation from their SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is ~ 50 %. It quickly drops to ~ 25 % for M &gt; 10^8 Msun. This is consistent with the results from sSFR(Ha), showing 80% and 17%, respectively. SFR(Ha)/SFR(UV) is a stricter criterion than those based on the galaxy sSFR(Ha), as it only identifies the strongest starbursts, the ones at the initial phases of a bursty star-formation episode.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>

      <title>Stellar Expansion or Inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>

      <title>Measuring redshift and galaxy properties via a multi-task neural net with probabilistic outputs: An application to simulated MOONS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of large-scale astronomical surveys demands innovative approaches for rapid and accurate analysis of extensive spectral data, and a promising direction to address this challenge is offered by artificial intelligence (AI). Here we introduce a new pipeline, M-TOPnet (Multi-Task network Outputting Probabilities), which employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning to simultaneously derive redshift and other key physical properties of galaxies from their spectra. Our tool efficiently encodes spectral information into a latent space, employing distinct downstream branches for each physical quantity, thereby benefiting from multi-task learning. Notably, our method handles the redshift output as a probability distribution, allowing for a more refined and robust estimation of this critical parameter. We demonstrate preliminary results using simulated data from the MOONS instrument, which will be soon operating at the ESO/VLT. We highlight the effectiveness of our tool in accurately predicting redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate for galaxies at z&gt;~1-3, even for faint sources (m_H &gt;~ 24) where traditional methods often struggle. Through analysis of the output probability distributions, we demonstrate that our pipeline enables robust quality screening of the results, achieving accuracy rates of up to 99% in redshift determination (defined as predictions within |Delta_z| &lt; 0.01 relative to the true redshift) with 8 h exposure spectra, while automatically identifying potentially problematic cases. Our AI pipeline thus emerges as a powerful solution for the upcoming challenges in observational astronomy, combining precision, interpretability, and efficiency, all aspects which are crucial for analysing the massive datasets expected from next-generation instruments.</description>

      <title>Globular clusters as cosmic clocks: new cosmological hints from their integrated light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the reliability and robustness in measuring the age, metallicity and mass of a sample of old Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) from their integrated light, setting the stage for using GCs as cosmic clocks at high redshift. We analyse 77 GCs from the WAGGS project, first by measuring Lick indices and spectroscopic breaks with PyLick, then performing full-spectral-fitting (FSF) with BAGPIPES. The analysis of Lick indices offers an estimate of the GCs' age and [Z/H], generally aligning with literature values, but highlights a subset of old GCs for which we estimate younger ages. This discrepancy is attributed to the presence of blue horizontal branches (HB), which are not accounted for in the stellar population models. With FSF we measure the GCs' ages, [Z/H], and masses, also testing the cosmological prior's impact on ages. Compared to isochrone fitting estimates, ages are best recovered when the cosmological prior is removed, with a 20% increase in GCs' ages compatible with literature values (within $\pm$1.5 Gyr). The derived [Z/H] and mass agree with the reference values, regardless of HB morphology or fit setting, with average discrepancies across the entire sample of $\Delta$[Z/H]=-0.02$\pm$0.24 dex and $\Delta log(M/M_{\odot})=0.04\pm 0.28$ dex. Ages are best recovered for metal-rich GCs ([Z/H]$\geq$-0.4) showing a red HB (HBR&gt;0), with 70% of the results compatible with literature values. Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we identify a tail of 24 old GCs with age=13.4$\pm$1.1 Gyr. Being a natural lower limit to the age of the Universe, we use this value to constrain $H_0$, obtaining $H_0 = 70.5^{+7.7}_{-6.3}$ km/s/Mpc (stat+syst) when a flat $\Lambda$CDM with $\Omega_m =0.30 \pm 0.02$ is assumed. Validating the study of GCs based on integrated light lays the foundation to extend this type of study to high-z, where lensed GCs have begun to appear, thanks to JWST. (abridged)</description>

      <title>An interferometric search for SiO maser emission in planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maser emission of SiO, H$_2$O and, OH is widespread in Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with oxygen(O)-rich envelopes. This emission quickly disappear during the post-AGB phase and is extremely rare in planetary nebulae (PN). So far, only eight PNe have been confirmed to show OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, and none has ever been found to show SiO maser emission. We intend to obtain the first detection of a SiO maser from a PNe. Such a detection would provide us with a useful tool to probe mass-loss in PNe at a scales of a few AU from the central star, much shorter than the scales traced by H$_2$ or OH masers. We compiled two different samples. The first one comprises all known PNe with confirmed OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, as well as two candidate PNe showing OH masers. For the second sample we compiled single-dish SiO maser detections in the literature, and compared them with catalogs of PNe and radio continuum emission (which could trace photoionized gas in a PNe). We identified five targets (either PN or radio continuum sources) within the beam of the single-dish SiO maser observations. We then carried out interferometric observations of both samples with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, to confirm the spatial association between continuum and SiO maser emission. We found no SiO maser emission associated with any confirmed or candidate PN. In all targets, except IRAS 17390$-$3014, there is no spatial coincidence between SiO masers and radio continuum emission. While in IRAS 17390$-$3014 we cannot completely rule out a possible association, it is unlikely that the radio continuum emission arises from a planetary nebula. The absence of SiO maser emission in PNe showing OH or H$_2$O masers is of special interest, since thermal SiO emission has been reported in at least one of these targets, indicating that SiO molecules can be present in gas phase.</description>

      <title>The Excess of JWST Bright Galaxies: a Possible Origin in the Ground State of Dynamical Dark Energy in the light of DESI 2024 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ${\Lambda}$ CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range $10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15$ needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ${\Omega}_{\Lambda}$=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range $15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$.</description>

      <title>High Precision Astrometry Science in the Context of Space Mission Prospectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry is one of the oldest branches of astronomy which measures the position, the proper motion and parallax of celestial objects. Following the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that have measured several billions of them using global astrometry, we propose to increase astrometry precision on pointed objects using differential astrometry in a large field in order to unravel rocky planets in habitable zones of stars in the Sun vicinity and investigate the nature of dark matter in galactic environments as recommended by the ESA Senior Committee in the Voyager 2050 prospective. Substantial technology developments in a number of critical areas is needed in order to reach the highest required precision of sub-micro-arcsecond. One of them is CMOS image sensors using the stitching technique to merge the multiple design structures on the wafer and produce array with very large number of pixels. Another one is to calibrate the pixel positions using projecting modulating interferometric laser fringes on the array. Finally, the distortion of the optical system can be monitored and compensated using reference stars as metrology sources. The final precision depends on the diameter and the field of view of the telescope that is used as well as the time spent on each target. We present here the science goals that can be achieved with such missions either within the framework of an ESA Medium-class mission or even in the NASA most challenging Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope recommended by the American Astronomy and Astrophysics prospective for the 2020s and designed specifically to search for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars.</description>

      <title>A multi-faceted view of the X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert galaxy Ark 120</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing a range of techniques including multi-band light curves, softness ratio analysis, structure functions, rms spectra, cross-correlation functions, and ratios of spectra from different intervals, we present a comprehensive study of the complex X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, through re-analyzing its six XMM-Newton observations taken between 2003 and 2014. We find a clear ''softer-when-brighter" trend in the 2--10 keV power-law component over long timescales, with this trend being timescale dependent, as it is much weaker on shorter timescales, similar to that previously detected in NGC 4051. Notably, a rare ''harder-when-brighter" trend is observed during one exposure, indicating dynamic changes in the spectral variability behavior of the power-law component. This exceptional exposure, with the spectral variability indeed marked by a power-law pivoting at an unusually low energy of ~ 2 keV, suggests intricate variations in the thermal Comptonization processes within the corona. Furthermore, when the data below 2 keV are included, we identify that the soft excess component adds significant complexity to the spectral variability, such as evidenced by a transition from ''harder-when-brighter'' to ''softer-when-brighter'' during another single exposure. Such extra complexity arises because the variability of the soft excess sometimes follows and sometimes does not follow the changes in the power-law component. Our findings underscore the necessity of applying multiple analytic techniques to fully capture the multifaceted spectral variability of AGNs.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectroscopy of multiple OB stars: I. The quadruple system HD 37061 at the centre of Messier 43</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are located in binary or multiple star systems. This poses additional challenges to quantitative analyses that use model atmospheres because little information is currently available on the chemical composition of such systems. The members of the quadruple star system HD 37061, which excites the H II region Messier 43 in Orion, are fully characterised. Accurate and precise abundances for all elements with lines traceable in the optical spectrum are derived for the first time. A hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) approach, using line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code in combination with non-LTE line-formation calculations with DETAIL and SURFACE, was employed. A high-resolution composite spectrum was analysed for the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of the individual stars. Fundamental stellar parameters were derived based on stellar evolution tracks, and the interstellar reddening was characterised. We determined the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances for three stars in the HD 37061 system. The fourth and faintest star in the system shows no distinct spectral features, as a result of its fast rotation. However, this star has noticeable effects on the continuum. The derived element abundances and determined ages of the individual stars are consistent with each other, and the abundances coincide with the cosmic abundance standard. We find an excellent agreement between our spectroscopic distance and the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax distance.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge of the composition of material that will form planets is crucial to understand planetary diversity and the occurrence of potentially habitable planets. Ultimately, it is the chemistry in circumstellar disks that determines the global make up of planetary systems, as the dust in these disks grows into giant planet cores and rocky planets, the gas becomes incorporated in giant planet atmospheres, and the ices can be delivered to rocky planets by comets and meteorites. With the advent of ALMA a decade ago and the recent launch of JWST, the composition of the disk gas and ice can now be studied in great detail. This review will provide an overview of our current knowledge of the disk chemical structure, focusing on the six elements essential to life on Earth: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S).</description>

      <title>Templated Anisotropic Analyses of the LISA Galactic Foreground</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of a supermassive black hole binary from its magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries will likely be surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk. Close to merger, gravitational radiation-driven inspiral will happen on timescales faster than the effective viscous time at the disk cavity wall, leading to a decoupling of the inner binary dynamics from the surrounding gaseous environment. Here we perform the first simulation of this decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical magnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify three main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to decoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during and after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling dual jets. (3) Post merger, the cavity wall becomes unstable and the magnetic flux trapped inside the cavity will get ejected in large coherent outbreak episodes with implications for potential multi-messenger transients to merging SMBH binaries.</description>

      <title>Confusion of extragalactic sources in the far infrared: a baseline assessment of the performance of PRIMAger in intensity and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of their limited angular resolution, far-infrared telescopes are usually affected by confusion phenomenon. Since several galaxies can be located in the same instrumental beam, only the brightest objects emerge from the fluctuations caused by fainter sources. The probe far-infrared mission for astrophysics imager (PRIMAger) will observe the mid- and far-infrared (25-235 $\mu$m) sky both in intensity and polarization. We aim to provide predictions of the confusion level and its consequences for future surveys. We produced simulated PRIMAger maps affected only by the confusion noise using the simulated infrared extragalactic sky (SIDES) semi-empirical simulation. We then estimated the confusion limit in these maps and extracted the sources using a basic blind extractor. By comparing the input galaxy catalog and the extracted source catalog, we derived various performance metrics as completeness, purity, and the accuracy of various measurements. In intensity, we predict that the confusion limit increases rapidly with increasing wavelength. The confusion limit in polarization is more than 100x lower. The measured flux density is dominated by the brightest galaxy in the beam, but other objects also contribute at longer wavelength (~30% at 235 $\mu$m). We also show that galaxy clustering has a mild impact on confusion in intensity (up to 25%), while it is negligible in polarization. In intensity, a basic blind extraction will be sufficient to detect galaxies at the knee of the luminosity function up to z~3 and 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$ main-sequence galaxies up to z~5. In polarization for a conservative sensitivity, we expect ~8 000 detections up to z=2.5 opening a totally new window on the high-z dust polarization. Finally, we show that intensity surveys at short wavelength and polarization surveys at long wavelength tend to reach confusion at similar depth. There is thus a strong synergy.</description>

      <title>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei. II. Mrk 463E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mrk 463 system is known to host two powerful sources separated by about 4 kpc, both identified as active galactic nuclei (AGN). This makes the Mrk 463 system a unique laboratory to study the geometry and dynamics of galaxy merging and its relation to AGN duty cycles. The eastern nuclei, Mrk 463E, is the brightest of the two and thus a prime target for a polarimetric study. It is classified as a Seyfert 2 galaxy, meaning that one could expect large polarization degrees from scattering off electrons and dust in the polar winds. In the continuity of our series of papers, we reduced archived and previously unpublished polarization observations obtained with the Faint Object Camera (FOC) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), to obtain a high resolution near ultraviolet (near-UV) polarization map of the Mrk 463E nuclei. We coupled this map to near infrared (NIR) and X-ray observations to get a clear picture of the geometric arrangement of matter around the core of Mrk 463E. We found that the nucleus location is further South from the optical peak flux than previously estimated. The strongly polarized conical wind has a half-opening angle of ~15{\deg} and display three main periods of mass ejection. Its polarization allowed us to estimate the AGN inclination towards the observer (~55{\deg}) Finally, our maps revealed a streamer connecting Mrk 463E and Mrk 463W, with a tentative detection of a large kpc-scale ordered magnetic field connecting both galaxies. This unpublished observation turned out to offer more than the original proposal asked for and allowed to derive tight geometric and dynamical constraints for Mrk 463E. High resolution radio maps and IR polarimetry are now necessary to further study the jet and the newly discovered streamer.</description>

Abstract: According to the well established hierarchical framework for galaxy evolution, galaxies grow through mergers with other galaxies and the LambdaCDM cosmological model predicts that the stellar halos of massive galaxies are rich in remnants from minor mergers. The Stellar Streams Legacy Survey (SSLS) has provided a first release of a catalogue with a statistically significant sample of stellar streams in the Local Universe, detected in deep images from DESI Legacy Surveys and the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The main objective is to compare the results of the observations of stellar tidal streams with predictions from state-of-the-art cosmological simulations regarding their abundance, up to a redshift z &lt; 0.02, according to the LambdaCDM model. We use the predictions of the cosmological simulations Copernicus Complexio, TNG50 of the IllustrisTNG project, and Auriga to generate mock-images of nearby halos and search for stellar streams. We compare the stream frequency, characteristics and photometry in these images with DES observations. We find generally good agreement between the real images and the simulated ones regarding frequency, characteristics and photometry of the streams, while the stream morphology is somewhat different between observations and simulations, and between simulations themselves. By varying the sky background of the synthetic images to emulate different surface brightness limit levels, we also obtain predictions for the detection rate of stellar tidal streams up to a surface brightness limit of 35 mag arcsec^-2. The cosmological simulations predict that with an instrument such as the one used in the DES, it would be necessary to reach a surface brightness limit of 32 mag arcsec^-2 in the r-band to achieve a frequency of up to around 70% in the detection of stellar tidal streams around galaxies in the redshift range considered here.</description>

      <title>The JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS): An untargeted search for H$\alpha$ emission line galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ and their physical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of the JWST Emission Line Survey (JELS). Utilising the first NIRCam narrow-band imaging at 4.7$\mu$m, over 63 arcmin$^{2}$ in the PRIMER/COSMOS field, we identified 609 emission line galaxy candidates. From these, we robustly selected 35 H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 6.1$, with H$\alpha$ star-formation rates ($\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$) $\sim0.9-15\ \rm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. Combining our unique H$\alpha$ sample with the exquisite panchromatic data in the field, we explored their physical properties and star-formation histories, and compared these to a broad-band selected sample at $z\sim 6$ which offered vital new insights into the nature of high-redshift galaxies. UV-continuum slopes ($\beta$) were considerably redder for our H$\alpha$ sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-1.92$) compared to the broad-band sample ($\langle\beta\rangle\sim-2.35$). This was not due to dust attenuation as our H$\alpha$ sample was relatively dust-poor (median $A_V=0.23$); instead, we argued the reddened slopes could be due to nebular continuum. We compared $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ and the UV-continuum-derived $\rm{SFR_{UV}}$ to SED-fitted measurements averaged over canonical timescales of 10 and 100 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{10}}$ and $\rm{SFR_{100}}$). We found an increase in recent SFR for our sample of H$\alpha$ emitters, particularly at lower stellar masses ($&lt;10^9 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$). We also found $\rm{SFR_{H\alpha}}$ strongly traced SFR averaged over 10 Myr timescales, whereas the UV-continuum over-predicts SFR on 100 Myr timescales at low stellar masses. These results point to our H$\alpha$ sample undergoing `bursty' star formation. Our F356W $z \sim 6$ sample showed a larger scatter in $\rm{SFR_{10}/SFR_{100}}$ across all stellar masses, which highlighted how narrow-band photometric selections of H$\alpha$ emitters are key to quantifying the burstiness of star-formation activity.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network -- II: Application to Next-Generation Wide-Field Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In Hong et al. (2021), we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field observations. Assuming the field of view ($3\deg.5 \times 3\deg.5$) and depth (27 mag at $5\sigma$) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training datasets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin$^{-2}$ from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves $\sim75$% completeness down to $\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust wide-field mass reconstructions on a routine basis.</description>

      <title>On the role of non-circular motions in MaNGA galaxies I: global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-circular (NC) motions represent the imprints of non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies, providing opportunities to study the physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation. In this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the non-circular motions in a sample of 1624 gas-rich disk galaxies from the MaNGA MPL-11. By using the H$\alpha$ velocity as a tracer of the disk rotation, we find indications that the amplitude of the non-circular motions is related to the stellar mass, with the low mass and late-type galaxies the most affected. In our sample, we find ratios of non-circular to circular rotation ranging from 5% to 20%. By implementing harmonic models to include NC motions associated with spiral arms and stellar bars, we find that the rotational curves traced with H$\alpha$ are barely affected by the NC induced by these structures. Consequently, in our sample, we do not find evidence that NC motions contribute to the scatter of the stellar Tully-Fisher relation. Our results suggest that non-circular motions might have a more localized effect in galaxies rather than a global one.</description>

      <title>High resolution HI mapping of nearby XMP BCD galaxies</title>

Abstract: Optical observations of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) show they typically have high specific star formation rates and low metallicites. A subset of these galaxies (those with the lowest gas phase metallicities) display cometary optical morphologies similar to those found at high redshift. Whether this combination of properties predominantly arises from interactions with neighbours or accretion from the cosmic web or something else remains unclear. We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes driving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs. We present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For three of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby companions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby interaction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent interactions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal forces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic redshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine that it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the range 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in our small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI morphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD's optical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the end of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be undergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal interaction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs with companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other authors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or mergers.</description>

      <title>Radial properties of dust in galaxies: Comparison between observations and isolated galaxy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the importance of several processes that influence the evolution of dust and its grain size distribution on spatially resolved scales in nearby galaxies. Here, we compiled several multi-wavelength observations for the nearby galaxies NGC628(M74), NGC5457(M101), NGC598(M33), and NGC300. We applied spatially resolved spectral energy distribution fitting to the latest iteration of infrared data to get constraints on the galaxy dust masses and the small-to-large grain abundance ratio. For comparison, we took the radial profiles of the stellar mass and gas mass surface density for NGC628 combined with its metallicity gradient in the literature to calibrate a single-galaxy simulation using the GADGET4-OSAKA code. The simulations include a parametrization to separate the dense and diffuse phases of the ISM where different dust-evolution mechanisms are in action. We find that our simulation can reproduce the radial profile of dust mass surface density but overestimates the SLR in NGC628. Changing the dust-accretion timescale has little impact on the dust mass or SLR, as most of the available metals are accreted onto dust grains at early times (&lt; 3Gyr), except in the outer regions of the galaxy. This suggests we can only constrain the accretion timescale of galaxies at extremely low metallicities where accretion still competes with other mechanisms controlling the dust budget. The overestimation of the SLR likely results from (i) overly efficient shattering processes in the diffuse interstellar medium, which were calibrated to reproduce Milky Way-type galaxies and/or (ii) our use of a diffuse and dense gas density subgrid model that does not entirely capture the intricacies of the small-scale structure present in NGC628.</description>

      <title>On the Ubiquity of Extreme Baryon Concentrations in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed the ubiquitous presence in the early Universe, up to z about 16, of extreme baryon concentrations, namely forming globular clusters, extremely dense galaxies that may or may not be UV bright, and supermassive black holes in relatively low-mass galaxies. This paper is trying to pinpoint which physical conditions may have favored the formation of such concentrations, that appear to be very common at high redshifts while their formation being progressively more and more rare at lower redshifts. Building on local globular cluster evidence, it is argued that such conditions can consist in a combination of a 10 Myr extended feedback free time, coupled to low angular-momentum densities in deep local minima of the ISM vorticity field, where baryon concentrations are more likely to form. It is argued that the former condition would follow from more massive stars failing to explode as supernovae, and the latter one from low vorticity prevailing in the early Universe, in contrast to later times with their secular increase of the angular momentum density due to the cumulative effect of tidal interactions.</description>

      <title>A "Galactic Disk"-Model for Three-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes in a Finite Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model, inspired by the structure of galactic disks, for three-dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a plasma with a uniform finite background magnetic field is presented. These modes are exact nonlinear solutions of the steady-state Vlasov equation, with an electric potential and a magnetic potential perturbation localized in all three spatial dimensions that satisfies the Poisson equation, and the Ampere Law, self-consistently. The existence of solutions is shown analytically in the limit of small electric and magnetic field perturbations associated with the disk species, and numerically using an iterative method that converges up to moderately strong field perturbations.</description>

      <title>A geometric distortion solution specifically for historical observations and its implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric distortion (GD) critically constrains the precision of astrometry. Using well-established methods to correct GD requires calibration observations, which can only be obtained using a special dithering strategy during the observation period. Unfortunately, this special observation mode is not often used, especially for the historical observations before those GD correction methods presented. As a result, some telescopes have no GD calibration observations for a long period, making it impossible to accurately determine the GD effect. This limits the value of the telescope observations in certain astrometric scenarios, such as using historical observations of moving targets in the solar system to improve their orbits. We investigated a method for handling GD that does not rely on the calibration observations. With this advantage, it can be used to solve the GD models of telescopes which were intractable in the past. The method was implemented in Python and released on GitHub. It was then applied to solve GD in the observations taken with the 1-m and 2.4-m telescopes at Yunnan Observatory. The resulting GD models were compared with those obtained using well-established methods to demonstrate the accuracy. Furthermore, the method was applied in the reduction of observations for two targets, the moon of Jupiter (Himalia) and the binary GSC2038-0293, to show its effectiveness. After GD correction, the astrometric results for both targets show improvements. Notably, the mean residual between observed and computed position (O-C) for the binary GSC2038-0293 decreased from 36 mas to 5 mas.</description>

      <title>Improving Photometric Galaxy Clustering Constraints With Cross-Bin Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering studies in current photometric galaxy surveys focus solely on auto-correlations, neglecting cross-correlations between redshift bins. We evaluate the potential advantages and drawbacks of incorporating cross-bin correlations in Fisher forecasts for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the forthcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Our analysis considers the impact of including redshift space distortions (RSD) and magnification in model predictions, as well as systematic uncertainties in photometric redshift distributions (photo-$z$). While auto-correlations alone suffer from a degeneracy between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) and galaxy bias parameters, accounting for RSD and magnification in cross-correlations helps break this degeneracy - although more weakly than the degeneracy breaking expected from a combined analysis with other observables. Incorporating cross-bin correlations does not significantly increase sensitivity to photo-$z$ systematics, addressing previous concerns, and self-calibrates photo-$z$ systematics, reducing errors on photo-$z$ nuisance parameters. We suggest that the benefits of including cross-correlations in future photometric galaxy clustering analyses outweigh the risks, but caution that careful evaluation is necessary as more realistic pictures of surveys' precision and systematic error budgets develop.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of the Star Formation Excess Discovered by JWST through Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a larger number of bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ than was expected. The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at $z\gtrsim10$, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at $z\lesssim6$ can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at $z\simeq10$, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots'', could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Cosmic Dispersion Measure in the D &lt; 120 Mpc Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Local Universe (D &lt; 120 Mpc) has been intensely studied for decades, with highly complete galaxy redshift surveys now publicly available. These data have driven density reconstructions of the underlying matter density field, as well as constrained simulations that aim to reproduce the observed structures. In this paper, we introduce a dispersion measure (DM) model that makes use of this detailed knowledge of our Local Universe within D &lt; 120 Mpc. The model comprises three key components: (i) the DM from the Milky Way halo and the intra-group medium (up to 3.4 Mpc), derived from the HESTIA simulations, a series of constrained hydrodynamic simulations designed to reproduce our Local Group; (ii) the DM contribution from the large-scale intergalactic medium beyond the Local Group (3.4 Mpc &lt; D &lt; 120 Mpc), calculated using the HAMLET reconstructed matter density field; and (iii) the individual DM contributions from Local Universe galaxy halos and clusters based on data from the 2MASS Galaxy Group Catalog and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. This comprehensive model will be made available as a Python package. As the most realistic model to date for DM in the local volume, it promises to improve the constraints of DM contributions from the Intergalactic Medium and Circumgalactic Medium of FRBs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cosmic baryon distribution calculations based on DM analysis of FRBs.</description>
