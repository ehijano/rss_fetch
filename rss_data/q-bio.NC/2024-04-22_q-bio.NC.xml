      <title>A neural network account to Kant's philosophical aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Kant's (1724 -- 1804) philosophical aesthetics, laid down in his Critique of the Power of Judgement (1790), beauty is "subjective purposefulness", reflected by the "harmony of the cognitive faculties", which are "understanding" and "imagination". On the one hand, understanding refers to the mental capability to find regularities in sensory manifolds, while imagination refers to intuition, fantasy, and creativity of the mind, on the other hand. Inspired by the reinforcement learning theory of Schmidhuber, I present a neural network analogy for the harmony of the faculties in terms of generative adversarial networks (GAN) - also often employed for artificial music composition -- by identifying the generator module with the faculty of imagination and the discriminator module with the faculty of understanding. According to the GAN algorithm, both modules are engaged in an adversarial game, thereby optimizing a particular objective function. In my reconstruction, the convergence of the GAN algorithm during the reception of art, either music or fine, entails the harmony of the faculties and thereby a neural network analogue of subjective purposefulness, i.e., beauty.</description>

      <title>The Length and the Width of the Human Brain Circuit Connections are Strongly Correlated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations of several fundamental properties of human brain connections are investigated in a consensus connectome, constructed from 1064 braingraphs, each on 1015 vertices, corresponding to 1015 anatomical brain areas. The properties examined include the edge length, the fiber number, or edge width, meaning the number of discovered axon bundles forming the edge and the occurrence number of the edge, meaning the number of individual braingraphs where the edge exists. By using our previously published robust braingraphs at \url{https://braingraph.org}, we have prepared a single consensus graph from the data and compared the statistical similarity of the edge occurrence numbers, edge lengths, and fiber counts of the edges. We have found a strong positive Spearman correlation between the edge occurrence numbers and the fiber count numbers, showing that statistically, the most frequent cerebral connections have the largest widths, i.e., the fiber number. We have found a negative Spearman correlation between the fiber lengths and fiber counts, showing that, typically, the shortest edges are the widest or strongest by their fiber counts. We have also found a negative Spearman correlation between the occurrence numbers and the edge lengths: it shows that typically, the long edges are infrequent, and the frequent edges are short.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the width of subjective temporality: the self-simulational theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the free energy principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a mechanism for duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Building on the transparent inferential format of self-modelling, it will be explained why subjective temporality feels like a genuine dimension, in which our life unfolds, as opposed to a mere mental construct, such as the mental number line. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulation. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the subjective compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of subjective time experience in deep and concentrated states of meditative absorption. Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific variations of subjective time experience are computationally explained, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns the temporality modulating role of negative valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, and near death-experiences, amongst others. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities.</description>

      <title>Break-up and Recovery of Harmony between Direct and Indirect Pathways in The Basal Ganglia; Huntington's Disease and Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basal ganglia (BG) in the brain exhibit diverse functions for motor, cognition, and emotion. Such BG functions could be made via competitive harmony between the two competing pathways, direct pathway (DP) (facilitating movement) and indirect pathway (IP) (suppressing movement). As a result of break-up of harmony between DP and IP, there appear pathological states with disorder for movement, cognition, and psychiatry. In this paper, we are concerned about the Huntington's disease (HD), which is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder causing involuntary movement and severe cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. For the HD, the number of D2 SPNs ($N_{\rm D2}$) is decreased due to degenerative loss, and hence, by decreasing $x_{\rm D2}$ (fraction of $N_{\rm D2}$), we investigate break-up of harmony between DP and IP in terms of their competition degree ${\cal C}_d$, given by the ratio of strength of DP (${\cal S}_{DP}$) to strength of IP (${\cal S}_{IP}$) (i.e., ${\cal C}_d = {\cal S}_{DP} / {\cal S}_{IP}$). In the case of HD, the IP is under-active, in contrast to the case of Parkinson's disease with over-active IP, which results in increase in ${\cal C}_d$ (from the normal value). Thus, hyperkinetic dyskinesia such as chorea (involuntary jerky movement) occurs. We also investigate treatment of HD, based on optogenetics and GP ablation, by increasing strength of IP, resulting in recovery of harmony between DP and IP. Finally, we study effect of loss of healthy synapses of all the BG cells on HD. Due to loss of healthy synapses, disharmony between DP and IP increases, leading to worsen symptoms of the HD.</description>
