      <title>How do managers' non-responses during earnings calls affect analyst forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of managers' non-responses (NORs) during quarterly earnings calls on analyst forecast behavior by developing a novel measure of NORs using two large language models: ChatGPT-4 and LLaMA 3.3. We adopt a three step prompting approach including identification, classification, and evaluation, to extract NORs from earnings call transcripts of S&amp;P 500 firms. We find that a higher incidence of NORs is significantly associated with greater analyst forecast errors, dispersion, and uncertainty. These effects are more pronounced among firms with high institutional ownership, greater R&amp;D expenditures, operations across multiple industries, and earnings calls held during the COVID-19 period. Further analysis shows that NORs are followed by greater post-earnings announcement drift, higher return volatility, increased trading volume, and wider bid-ask spreads, suggesting that NORs raise information processing costs and exacerbate uncertainty. Overall, our findings indicate that managers' non-responses during earnings calls impair the information environment for analysts and investors.</description>

      <title>Down to the Last Strike: The Effect of the Jury Lottery on Criminal Convictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much does luck matter to a criminal defendant in a jury trial? We use rich data on jury selection to causally estimate how parties who are randomly assigned a less favorable jury (as proxied by whether their attorneys exhaust their peremptory strikes) fare at trial. Our novel identification strategy is unique in that it captures variation in juror predisposition coming from variables unobserved by the econometrician but observed by attorneys. We find that criminal defendants who lose the "jury lottery" are more likely to be convicted than their similarly-situated counterparts, with a significant increase (~19 percentage points) for Black defendants. Our results suggest that a considerable number of cases would result in different verdicts if retried with new (counterfactual) random draws of the jury pool, raising concerns about the variance of justice in the criminal legal system.</description>

      <title>A representation theorem for events within lattice structures of state-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the standard lattice model of information structures, we derive a reduced poset representation which provides the same informational content as the complete lattice structure which derives it. Rational agents can recover the complete lattice of events by means of the reduced poset alone. We find that both structures provide isomorphic models under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>An AI Capability Threshold for Rent-Funded Universal Basic Income in an AI-Automated Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the first closed-form condition under which artificial intelligence (AI) capital profits could sustainably finance a universal basic income (UBI) without additional taxes or new job creation. In a Solow-Zeira economy characterized by a continuum of automatable tasks, a constant net saving rate $s$, and task-elasticity $\sigma &lt; 1$, we analyze how the AI capability threshold--defined as the productivity level of AI relative to pre-AI automation--varies under different economic scenarios. At present economic parameters, we find that AI systems must achieve only approximately 5-6 times existing automation productivity to finance an 11\%-of-GDP UBI, in the worst case situation where \emph{no} new jobs or tasks are created.
  Our analysis also reveals some specific policy levers: raising public revenue share (e.g. profit taxation) of AI capital from the current 15\% to about 33\% halves the required AI capability threshold to attain UBI to 3 times existing automotion productivity, but gains diminish beyond 50\% public revenue share, especially if regulatory costs increase. Market structure also strongly affects outcomes: monopolistic or concentrated oligopolistic markets reduce the threshold by increasing economic rents, whereas heightened competition significantly raises it.
  Overall, these results suggest a couple policy recommendations: maximizing public revenue share up to a point so that operating costs are minimized, and strategically managing market competition can ensure AI's growing capabilities translate into meaningful social benefits within realistic technological progress scenarios.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Growth, Employment, and Technological Change: Experiential Matrix Theory and the Transition from GDP to Humanist Experiential Growth in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Experiential Matrix Theory (EMT), a general theory of growth, employment, and technological change for the age of artificial intelligence (AI). EMT redefines utility as the alignment between production and an evolving, infinite-dimensional matrix of human experiential needs, thereby extending classical utility frameworks and integrating ideas from the capabilities approach of Sen and Nussbaum into formal economic optimisation modelling. We model the economy as a dynamic control system in which AI collapses ideation and coordination costs, transforming production into a real-time vector of experience-aligned outputs. Under this structure, the production function becomes a continuously learning map from goods to experiential utility, and economic success is redefined as convergence toward an asymptotic utility frontier. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle in an infinite-dimensional setting, we derive conditions under which AI-aligned output paths are asymptotically optimal, and prove that unemployment is Pareto-inefficient wherever unmet needs and idle human capacities persist. On this foundation, we establish Alignment Economics as a new research field dedicated to understanding and designing economic systems in which technological, institutional, and ethical architectures co-evolve. EMT thereby reframes policy, welfare, and coordination as problems of dynamic alignment, not static allocation, and provides a mathematically defensible framework for realigning economic production with human flourishing. As ideation costs collapse and new experiential needs become addressable, EMT shows that economic growth can evolve into an inclusive, meaning-centred process -- formally grounded, ethically structured, and AI-enabled.</description>

      <title>Private MEV Protection RPCs: Benchmark Stud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on Ethereum has undergone significant transformations since its emergence during the DeFi summer of 2020. With the introduction of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), the transaction supply chain on Ethereum has shifted from relying entirely on the public mempool for DeFi interactions to an astonishing 80% usage of private RPCs. These private RPCs submit transactions directly to builders, skipping the public mempool, while conducting Order Flow Auctions (OFAs) to capture MEV backrun rebates and gas rebates. Our findings reveal that not all RPCs OFAs produce the same outcomes. These insights underscore the significant implications of OFA design choices on transaction efficiency and execution quality, and thus why an order flow originators should pay close attention to which OFA they use.</description>

      <title>Faithful Group Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data Shapley is an important tool for data valuation, which quantifies the contribution of individual data points to machine learning models. In practice, group-level data valuation is desirable when data providers contribute data in batch. However, we identify that existing group-level extensions of Data Shapley are vulnerable to shell company attacks, where strategic group splitting can unfairly inflate valuations. We propose Faithful Group Shapley Value (FGSV) that uniquely defends against such attacks. Building on original mathematical insights, we develop a provably fast and accurate approximation algorithm for computing FGSV. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency and approximation accuracy, while ensuring faithful group-level valuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the timing of NGO campaigns to shed light on NGOs' strategies and how they evolve over time. Data from 2,500 campaigns show that NGOs are six times more likely to launch campaigns on their target's Annual General Meeting (AGM) date. Although this strategy increases media exposure and stakeholder scrutiny, resulting in consumer backlash and related shareholder proposals at the following AGM of the targeted firm, it has no impact on current AGM votes. As NGOs build reputational capital, they adjust their timing to influence AGM votes, revealing the trade-offs they face to drive corporate change.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomics of Racial Disparities: Discrimination, Labor Market, and Wealth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of racial discrimination in hiring on employment, wages, and wealth disparities between black and white workers. Using a labor search-and-matching model with racially prejudiced and non-prejudiced firms, we show that labor market frictions sustain discriminatory practices as an equilibrium outcome. These practices account for 57% of the racial unemployment gap, 48% of the average wage gap, and 16% of the median wealth gap. Discriminatory hiring also increases unemployment and wage volatility for black workers, increasing their labor market risks over the business cycle. Eliminating prejudiced firms reduces these disparities and improves the welfare of black workers as well as the overall economic welfare.</description>

      <title>Quantitative analysis of the value of investment in research facilities, with examples from cyberinfrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: How much to invest in research facilities has long been a question in higher education and research policy. We present established and recently developed techniques for assessing the quantitative value created or received as a result of investments in research facilities. This discussion is timely. Financial challenges in higher education may soon force difficult decisions regarding investment in research facilities at some institutions. Clear quantitative analysis will be necessary for such strategic decision-making. Further, institutions of higher education in the USA are currently being called on to justify their value to society. The analyses presented here are extendable to research enterprises as a whole. Results: We present methods developed primarily for analyses of cyberinfrastructure. Most analyses comparing investment in university-based cyberinfrastructure facilities with purchasing services from commercial sources demonstrate positive results for economic and scientific research. A recent assessment, based on a comprehensive accounting approach, has shown that for one large publicly funded cyberinfrastructure project the value delivered to the USA economy and society exceeded the cost to USA taxpayers. Conclusions: Quantitative analyses of the benefits of investment in research and research facilities create a fact-based foundation for discussing the value of research and higher education. These methods enable a quantitative assessment of the relationship between investment in specific research facilities or research projects and economic, societal, and educational outcomes. These methods are of value in quantifying the economic benefit of higher education and in managing investments within such institutions.</description>

      <title>Are Elites Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking? Evidence from MBA Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elites disproportionately influence policymaking, yet little is known about their fairness and efficiency preferences -- key determinants of individuals' support for redistributive policies. We investigate these preferences using an incentivized lab experiment with a group of future elites -- Ivy League MBA students. We find that MBA students implement substantially more unequal earnings distributions than the average American, regardless of whether inequality stems from luck or merit. Their redistributive choices are also highly responsive to efficiency costs, with an elasticity an order of magnitude larger than that found in representative US samples. Analyzing fairness ideals, we find that MBA students are less likely to be strict meritocrats than the general public. These findings provide novel insights into how elites' redistributive preferences may shape high levels of inequality and limited redistributive policy in the United States.</description>

      <title>International Comparisons: Multilateral Indices and Nonparametric Welfare Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilateral index numbers, such as those used to make international comparisons of prices and income, are fundamental objects in economics. However, these numbers are often challenging to interpret in terms of economic welfare, as a data-dependent 'taste bias' can arise for these indices that distorts measurement of price and income levels and dispersion. To study this problem, I develop a means to appraise indices' economic interpretability using non-parametric bounds on a true cost-of-living index. These bounds improve upon their classical counterparts, define a new class of indices that generalises the 'star' system, and show how existing indices can be corrected for preference misspecification. In my main application I appraise existing international comparison methods. I find that taste bias generally leads to overestimates (underestimates) of price (income) levels. Superlative indices, such as the Fisher-GEKS index, lie within the permitted bounds more frequently than non-superlative methods, but the mean size of this bias is modest in all examined cases. My results can thus be interpreted as supporting the economic validity of the myriad multilateral methods which are in practical use.</description>

      <title>Vague Knowledge: Evidence from Analyst Reports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less-known role in representing subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and only communicated through language.</description>

      <title>Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning risk management, hedging, and portfolio diversification. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications such as SIC and GICS codes to gauge similarity, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Since these classifications lack granularity and need regular updating, using clusters of embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential alternative, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing Large Language Model (LLM) activations into interpretable features. Moreover, SAEs capture an LLM's internal representation of a company description, as opposed to semantic similarity alone, as is the case with embeddings. We apply SAEs to company descriptions, and obtain meaningful clusters of equities. We benchmark SAE features against SIC-codes, Industry codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate that SAE features surpass sector classifications and embeddings in capturing fundamental company characteristics. This is evidenced by their superior performance in correlating logged monthly returns - a proxy for similarity - and generating higher Sharpe ratios in co-integration trading strategies, which underscores deeper fundamental similarities among companies. Finally, we verify the interpretability of our clusters, and demonstrate that sparse features form simple and interpretable explanations for our clusters.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Frontier Structural Function and Bounding Mean Deviations</title>

Abstract: This paper analyzes a model in which an outcome variable equals a frontier function of inputs less a nonnegative unobserved deviation. If zero lies in the support of the deviation given inputs, then the frontier function is identified by the supremum outcome at those inputs. This obviates the need for instrumental variables. Implementation requires allowing for the distribution of deviations to depend on inputs, thus not ruling out endogeneity. Including random errors yields a stochastic frontier analysis model. We generalize this model to allow the joint distribution of deviations and errors to depend on inputs. We derive a lower bound for the mean deviation based only on variance and skewness, requiring no other distributional assumptions and remaining valid even when zero is not in the support of deviations or data are sparse near the frontier. We apply our results to a frontier production function, where deviations represent inefficiencies.</description>
