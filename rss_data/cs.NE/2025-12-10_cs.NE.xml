      <title>Conditional Morphogenesis: Emergent Generation of Structural Digits via Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems exhibit remarkable morphogenetic plasticity, where a single genome can encode various specialized cellular structures triggered by local chemical signals. In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems. This work bridges the gap between texture-based NCAs and structural pattern formation, offering a lightweight, biologically plausible alternative for conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Softly Symbolifying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.</description>

      <title>Towards symbolic regression for interpretable clinical decision scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.</description>

      <title>Resonant and Stochastic Vibration in Neurorehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological injuries and age-related decline can impair sensory processing and disrupt motor coordination, gait, and balance. As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks. We conclude by outlining the most important research needs for translating vibration-based interventions into reliable and deployable clinical tools.</description>

      <title>Long-only cryptocurrency portfolio management by ranking the assets: a neural network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper will propose a novel machine learning based portfolio management method in the context of the cryptocurrency market. Previous researchers mainly focus on the prediction of the movement for specific cryptocurrency such as the bitcoin(BTC) and then trade according to the prediction. In contrast to the previous work that treats the cryptocurrencies independently, this paper manages a group of cryptocurrencies by analyzing the relative relationship. Specifically, in each time step, we utilize the neural network to predict the rank of the future return of the managed cryptocurrencies and place weights accordingly. By incorporating such cross-sectional information, the proposed methods is shown to profitable based on the backtesting experiments on the real daily cryptocurrency market data from May, 2020 to Nov, 2023. During this 3.5 years, the market experiences the full cycle of bullish, bearish and stagnant market conditions. Despite under such complex market conditions, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and annualized return of 64.26%. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be robust to the increase of transaction fee.</description>

      <title>Long-Sequence LSTM Modeling for NBA Game Outcome Prediction Using a Novel Multi-Season Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of professional basketball games, particularly in the National Basketball Association (NBA), has become increasingly important for coaching strategy, fan engagement, and sports betting. However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l, \boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-Parametric Multi-Task Optimization: Joint Search in Solution and Infinite Task Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.</description>

      <title>Not Just for Archiving: Provable Benefits of Reusing the Archive in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs (MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1) mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs, and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants. We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can generally hold in practice by experiments on well-known practical optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04622v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.</description>

      <title>HERMES: Heterogeneous Application-Enabled Routing Middleware for Edge-IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.</description>
