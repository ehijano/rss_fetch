      <title>Highly Polarized Type III Storm Observed with Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft observed a large coronal mass ejection (CME) on 5 September 2022, shortly before closest approach during the 13th PSP solar encounter. For several days following the CME, PSP detected a storm of Type III radio bursts. Stokes parameter analysis of the radio emission indicates that the Type III storm was highly circularly polarized. Left hand circularly polarized (LHC) emission dominated at the start of the storm, transitioning to right hand circularly polarized (RHC) emission at the crossing of the heliospheric current sheet on 6 September.
  We analyze the properties of this Type III storm. The drift rate of the Type IIIs indicates a constant beam speed of $\sim$0.1$c$, typical for Type III-producing electron beams. The sense of polarization is consistent with fundamental emission generated primarily in the $O$-mode.
  The stable and well organized post-CME magnetic field neatly separates the LHC- and RHC-dominated intervals of the storm, with minimal overlap between the senses of polarization. The proximity of PSP to the source region, both in radial distance and in heliographic longitude, makes this event an ideal case study to connect in situ plasma measurements with remote observations of radio emission.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Electron Acceleration and the 'Ankle' Spectral Feature in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons are accelerated to high, non-thermal energies during explosive energy-release events in space, such as magnetic reconnection. However, the properties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly associated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study utilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and spectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV) electrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This event provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized by X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field directly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation period. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were clearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed away from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly from the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons deviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an "ankle" feature similar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of "ankle" electrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the separatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations. Further analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated from the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during transport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at the X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Alfven pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfven pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. Using perturbation theory and the solution found for the case of a homogeneous in a cross section magnetic tube, the electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfven wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e. accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined. For the chromospheric footpoints of the magnetic loops, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decay, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Determining the acceleration regions of in situ electrons using remote radio and X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles in the heliosphere are produced by flaring processes on the Sun or shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. These particles are regularly detected remotely as electromagnetic radiation (X-rays or radio emission), which they generate through various processes, or in situ by spacecraft monitoring the Sun and the heliosphere. We aim to combine remote-sensing and in situ observations of energetic electrons to determine the origin and acceleration mechanism of these particles. Here, we investigate the acceleration location, escape, and propagation directions of electron beams producing radio bursts observed with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and, in situ electrons observed at Solar Orbiter (SolO) on 3 October 2023. These observations are combined with a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the electron acceleration locations and results from a magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona in order to investigate the origin and connectivity of electrons observed remotely at the Sun to in situ electrons. We observed a type II radio burst with good connectivity to SolO, where a significant electron event was detected. However, type III radio bursts and Hard X-rays were also observed co-temporally with the elctron event but likely connected to SolO by different far-sided field lines. The injection times of the SolO electrons are simultaneous with both the onset of the type II radio burst, the group of type III bursts and the presence of a second HXR peak, however, the most direct connection to SolO is that of the type II burst location. The in situ electron spectra point to shock acceleration of electrons with a short-term connection to the source region.</description>

      <title>Scintillations in Southern Europe during the geomagnetic storm of June 2015: analysis of a plasma bubbles spill-over using ground-based data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to ionospheric disturbances and their constant growth are nowadays resulting in an increased concern of GNSS-users about the impacts of ionospheric disturbances at mid-latitudes. The geomagnetic storm of June 2015 is an example of a rare phenomenon of a spill-over of equatorial plasma bubbles well North from their habitual. We study the occurrence of small- and medium-scale irregularities in the North Atlantic Eastern-Mediterranean mid- and low-latitudinal zone by analysing the behaviour of the amplitude scintillation index S4 and of the rate of total electron content index (ROTI) during such a storm. In addition, large scale perturbations of the ionospheric electron density were studied using ground and space-born instruments, thus characterizing a complex perturbation behaviour over the region mentioned above. The multi-source data allows us to characterize the impact of irregularities of different scales to better understand the ionospheric dynamics and stress the importance of a proper monitoring of the ionosphere in the studied region.</description>

      <title>Turbulent multicomponent magnetopause: Analytical description and kinetic simulation of complex distributed current sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carry out particle-in-cell simulations of complex multicomponent current sheets of the family of analytically found Vlasov--Maxwell equilibria that model a collisionless magnetopause and allow for the arbitrary energy distributions and counter currents of various particle fractions. We find that, depending on the parameters, i) a weak small-scale bending-type instability is always present at the sharp low-density plasma boundary of such a magnetopause, and ii) the development of a small-scale Weibel-type instability inside a magnetopause is either excluded or possible. Both cases are studied and compared for two variants of the particle energy distribution~ -- Maxwellian and Kappa. The long-term stability of the whole current sheet is observed either without or with saturated Weibel-type turbulence, which can be generated in a low-magnetized region between neighboring counter currents. We point out the applicability of the developed model of distributed current sheets and the results of analysis of their small-scale instability for the description of physical phenomena in the magnetopauses of planets and late-type stars.</description>

      <title>Global transformer overheating from geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.</description>
