      <title>False positives for gravitational lensing: the gravitational-wave perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first detection of a novel astrophysical phenomenon, scientific standards are particularly high. Especially in a multi-messenger context, there are also opportunity costs to follow-up observations on any detection claims. So in searching for the still elusive lensed gravitational waves, care needs to be taken in controlling false positives. In particular, many methods for identifying strong lensing rely on some form of parameter similarity or waveform consistency, which under rapidly growing catalog sizes can expose them to false positives from coincident but unlensed events if proper care is not taken. And searches for waveform deformations in all lensing regimes are subject to degeneracies we need to mitigate between lensing, intrinsic parameters, insufficiently modelled effects such as orbital eccentricity, or even deviations from general relativity. Robust lensing studies also require understanding and mitigating glitches and non-stationarities in the detector data. This article reviews sources of possible false positives (and their flip side: false negatives) in gravitational-wave lensing searches and the main approaches the community is pursuing to mitigate them.</description>

      <title>Why you do not need to worry about the standard argument that you are a Boltzmann brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, namely a fleeting statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature claiming that this bizarre hypothesis needs to be considered seriously, that all of our data about the past is actually a mirage. We point to a difficulty in these arguments. They are based on the dynamical laws and on statistical arguments, but they disregard the fact that we infer the dynamical laws presupposing the reliability of our data records about the past. Hence the reasoning in favor of the Boltzmann brain hypothesis contradicts itself, relying on the reliability of our data about the past to conclude that that data is wrong. More broadly, it is based on incomplete evidence. Incomplete evidence notoriously leads to false conclusions.</description>

      <title>Measuring dynamical phase transitions in time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in methods for detecting and interpreting changes in experimental time evolution data. Based on measured time series, the quantitative characterization of dynamical phase transitions at bifurcation points of the underlying chaotic systems is a notoriously difficult task. Building on prior theoretical studies that focus on the discontinuities at $q=1$ in the order-$q$ R\'enyi-entropy of the trajectory space, we measure the derivative of the spectrum. We derive within the general context of Markov processes a computationally efficient closed-form expression for this measure. We investigate its properties through well-known dynamical systems exploring its scope and limitations. The proposed mathematical instrument can serve as a predictor of dynamical phase transitions in time series.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage tomography based on eigenanalysis for high-dimensional dense unitary quantum processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Process Tomography (QPT) methods aim at identifying, i.e. estimating, a quantum process. QPT is a major quantum information processing tool, since it especially allows one to experimentally characterize the actual behavior of quantum gates, that may be used as the building blocks of quantum computers. We here consider unitary, possibly dense (i.e. without sparsity constraints) processes, which corresponds to isolated systems. Moreover, we aim at developing QPT methods that are applicable to a significant number of qubits and hence to a high state space dimension, which allows one to tackle more complex problems. Using the unitarity of the process allows us to develop methods that first achieve part of QPT by performing an eigenanalysis of the estimated density matrix of a process output. Building upon this idea, we first develop a class of complete algorithms that are single-stage, i.e. that use only one eigendecomposition. We then extend them to multiple-stage algorithms (i.e. with several eigendecompositions), in order to address high-dimensional state spaces while being less limited by the estimation errors made when using an arbitrary given Quantum State Tomography (QST) algorithm as a building block of our overall methods. We first propose two-stage methods and we then extend them to dichotomic methods, whose number of stages increases with the considered state space dimension. The relevance of our methods is validated by means of simulations. Single-stage and two-stage methods first yield the following results. Just running them with standard PC and software already makes it possible to evaluate their performance for up to 13 qubits, i.e. with state space dimensions up to a few thousands. This shows their attractiveness in terms of accuracy and proves that they solve the core of the dense QPT problem in a very limited time frame. For other test results, see the paper.</description>

      <title>Mapping Inter-City Trade Networks to Maximum Entropy Models using Electronic Invoice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the network of transactions among cities based on the electronic invoice database for the municipalities in the Cear\'a state, Brazil. It consists of approximately 3.7 billion records, registered during the period between the years 2016 to 2019. All the transactions are grouped in a unique dataset and represented as an asymmetrical adjacency matrix corresponding to a directed graph with connections weighted by the number of transactions among cities. Due to the large size of Cear\'a state, its unequal distribution of wealth, and spatially heterogeneous population, we initially determine communities of cities based on their mutual intensity of trades and verify to which extent their economic interests reflect a community cohesiveness. For the first task, we use the Infomap algorithm to detect the partition which provides the shortest description length and captures the optimal community structure of the network in terms of its associated flow dynamics. Surprisingly, the partition identified has five modules, whose two-dimensional geographical projections are all simply-connected domains. We proceed with the analysis of traded products by building bipartite structures represented in terms of adjacency matrices between municipalities and products, considering selling and buying. Using the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) concept, we define a non-monetary and binary activity index that can distinguish the RCA of a city in a class of goods or services as evidenced by trade flows. Finally, through the pairwise Maximum Entropy Model, we can associate to the largest communities their corresponding binary Ising-like Hamiltonian models. In an analogy with critical phenomena, our results reveal that each community operates at a "temperature" that is close to the corresponding "critical point", suggesting a high degree of "economic cohesiveness" in its trade network of cities.</description>
