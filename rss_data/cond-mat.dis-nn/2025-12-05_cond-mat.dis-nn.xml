      <title>Diffusive geodesics wandering in networks of rigid chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble of spatial networks built from the junctions of hindered-rotation chains, incorporating directional correlations between bonds, an aspect ignored in the standard network modeling paradigm. The emergent random networks support geodesics with a wandering exponent $\xi = 1/2$, and a travel-time fluctuation exponent $\chi = 0$, consistent with the KPZ relation, yet violating the bound~$\chi\geq1/8$ predicted in the Poissonian framework. Transverse deviations follow the Kolmogorov distribution, indicating similarities between Brownian bridge excursions and geodesics in a random medium with correlated edges orientations. These results reveal a new universality class of Euclidean first-passage percolation, where local orientational memory reshapes transport properties and challenges existing bounds for random spatial networks.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Criterion for Stokes-Einstein Relation Breakdown Based on Effective Collisional Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we propose a kinetic framework for interpreting the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation breakdown in supercooled liquids by introducing an effective collision diameter, $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$, derived from transport data. Numerical simulation of a model CuZr alloy reveal that $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ increases upon cooling but saturates near the first peak of the radial distribution function just before SE breakdown. This saturation defines a geometric upper bound for the collisional cross-section beyond which further slowdown is governed by cooperative, heterogeneous motion rather than local collisional transport. Our analysis yields a compact criterion for SE breakdown in a mean-field perspective and provides physically interpretable inputs for future data-driven models of glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Crossover from Universal Depinning to Free Domain-Wall Dynamics in Ultrathin Iron Garnet Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic domain walls display universal, disorder-controlled elastic dynamics at low drive, and texture-governed free motion at high drive. Here, we establish the crossover mechanism between these two regimes. Using experiments in ultrathin epitaxial iron garnet films and Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations, including disorder, thermal, and internal texture effects, we uncover a disorder- and temperature-dependent precessional flow that bridges pinned and free dynamics. We further demonstrate that the exceptionally low pinning in garnets arises from the weak coupling between domain walls and disorder, together with a correlation length that exceeds the wall width.</description>

      <title>Exact and mean-field analysis of the role of Hubbard interactions on flux driven circular current in a quantum ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate circular current in both ordered and disordered Hubbard quantum rings threaded by magnetic flux, employing exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.</description>

      <title>Smeared phase transition in the dissipative random quantum Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of dissipation in the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model by means of a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization. This model has three phases and three quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smears two out of the three quantum phase transitions. Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases.</description>

      <title>Global phase diagram of two-dimensional dirty hyperbolic Dirac liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$\rho_{a}(0)$] and typical [$\rho_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schl\"afli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $\rho_{a}(0)$ and $\rho_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $\rho_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $\rho_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.</description>
