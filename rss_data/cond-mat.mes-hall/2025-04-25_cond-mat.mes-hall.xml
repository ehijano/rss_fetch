      <title>Semimetals without correspondence between the topological charge of nodal line/surface and Fermi arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that there is a correspondence between the topological charge of nodal points or lines and the presence of Fermi arcs. Using a $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-invariant system as an example, we demonstrate that this general belief is no longer valid. When two charged nodal lines or surfaces touch, the topological charge {dissipates without gap opening}, yet the surfaces or hinge Fermi arcs can remain preserved. It is found that both static and Floquet semimetals can exhibit Fermi arcs, even when the nodal lines or surfaces do not carry a $Z_2$ charge from second Stiefel-Whitney class.</description>

      <title>Ordered and Disordered Skyrmion States on a Square Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the ordering of skyrmions interacting with a square substrate created from a modulation of anisotropy using atomistic simulations. We consider fillings of {\it f} = 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 skyrmions per potential minimum as a function of magnetic field and sample size. For a filling of {\it f} = 2.0, we find various dimer orderings, such as tilted dimer states, as well as antiferromagnetic ordering that is similar to the colloidal dimer ordering seen on square substrates. The ability of the skyrmions to change shape or annihilate produces additional states that do not occur in the colloidal systems. For certain parameters at {\it f} = 2.0, half of the skyrmions can annihilate to form a square lattice, or a superlattice of trimers and monomers containing skyrmions of different sizes can form. At lower fields, ordered stretched skyrmion states can appear, and for zero field, there can be ordered stripe states. For {\it f} = 3.0, we find ferromagnetic ordered trimers, tilted lattices, columnar lattices, and stretched phases. For fillings of {\it f} = 1.5 and 2.5, we find bipartite lattices, different ordered and disordered states, and several extended disordered regions produced by frustration effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry and elliptic optical dichroism in $p$-wave magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor is composed of the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which is observable by means of optical absorption of elliptically polarized light. Especially, the quantum geometric tensor at the zero-momentum is observable by the optical absorption at the optical band edge. In this context, we study optical absorption of a $p$-wave magnet under irradiation of elliptically polarized light. The $p$-wave magnet has a band splitting along one axis, which we choose the $x$ axis. We obtain analytic formulae for the optical conductivity up to the second order in the magnitude of the N\'{e}el vector. In particular, the optical conductivity is exactly obtained when the N\'{e}el is along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axis. It shows strong ellipticity a dependence of the light polarization, which is an elliptic dichroism. Especially, there is a perfect elliptic optical dichroism when the N\'{e}el vector is along the $y$ axis. It is possible to determine the N\'{e}el vector by measuring the ellipticity of the perfect elliptic dichroism.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-induced collapse of Landau levels in Weyl semimetals and its detection via the planar Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE) is a powerful tool for characterizing Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Here, we inves- tigate the PHE in general anisotropic WSMs under strong magnetic fields. We analytically derive the Landau levels (LLs) and their wavefunctions using the Bogoliubov transformation, where the tilt vector, anisotropic axis of the Fermi velocity, and the magnetic field can be oriented in arbitrary directions. Notably, due to the interaction with the magnetic field and the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity, the component of the tilt vector perpendicular to the magnetic field can induce a tilt in the LLs parallel to the magnetic field. Our analytical re- sults show that the LLs do not collapse in type-I WSMs but must collapse in type-II WSMs when the magnetic field is vertical to the tilt vector. More importantly, we demonstrate that the magnetotransport signal of the LL collapse, which manifests as significant enhancement and quantum oscillations in the longitudinal and planar Hall conductivities simultaneously, can be used to identify the phase transition from type-I to type-II WSMs.</description>

      <title>Synchronized in-gap edge states and robust copropagation in topological insulators without magnetic flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copropagation of antichiral edge states in the metallic phase requires the bulk states as counterpropagating modes. Without the band gap protection, the copropagation along the boundaries is easily scattered into the bulk and the counterpropagation in the bulk is not robust against disorder and defects. Here, we propose a novel time-reversal symmetric topological insulator holding the synchronized in-gap edge states. To prevent the participation of bulk states, we introduce the time-reversal symmetry to detach the edge states from the bulk band, then the robust copropagation is realized through widening the band gap across a metal-insulator transition with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The time-reversal symmetry ensures the in-gap edge states with opposite momenta as the counterpropagating modes. The inversion symmetry protects the quantized polarization as a topological invariant. The synchronized in-gap edge states not only enrich the family of topological edge states, but also provide additional flexibility in the design of reconfigurable topological optical devices. Our findings open a new avenue for the tailored robust wave transport using the in-gap edge states for future acousto-optic topological metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Scalable Parallel Single-Electron Pumps in Silicon with Split-Source Control in the Nanoampere Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallelizing single-electron pumps offers a promising route to achieving nanoampere-level currents crucial for quantum current standard applications. Achieving such current levels is essential for demonstrating the ultra-high accuracy of single-electron pumps below 0.1 ppm toward quantum metrology triangle experiments. In addition, improving the accuracy at this current range is also desirable for practical small-current measurements. However, nanoampere-level currents have not yet been achieved with parallel pumps, mainly due to challenges in optimizing operating conditions. Here, we propose a scalable and easily implementable parallelization method based on tunable-barrier single-electron pumps with split source electrodes. By tuning the source voltages, we successfully parallelize four single-electron pumps at 200 MHz and further demonstrate a current plateau exceeding 2 nA using three pumps at 2.1 GHz. The wide applicability of this parallelization technique opens a path toward advancing high-accuracy quantum current standards.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>

      <title>Optimizing thermoelectric performance of graphene antidot lattices via quantum transport and machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, which can convert waste heat to electricity or be utilized as solid-state coolers, hold promise for sustainable energy applications. However, optimizing thermoelectric performance remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and thermal transport properties. In this work, we systematically optimize $ZT$ in graphene antidot lattices (GALs), nanostructured graphene sheets with periodic nanopores characterized by two geometric parameters: the hexagonal unit cell side length $L$ and the antidot radius $R$. The lattice thermal conductivity is determined through machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while electronic transport properties are computed using linear-scaling quantum transport in combination with MD trajectories based on a bond-length-dependent tight-binding model. This method is able to account for electron-phonon scattering, allowing access to diffusive transport in large-scale systems, overcoming limitations of previous methods based on nonequilibrium Green function formalism. Our results show that the introduction of the antidots effectively decouples lattice and electronic transport and lead to a favorable and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. We find that optimal $ZT$ values occur in GALs with intermediate $L$ and $R$, closely correlated with peak power factor values. Notably, thermoelectric performance peaks near room temperature, with maximal $ZT$ values approaching 2, highlighting GALs as promising candidates for high-performance thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Consistency between the Green-Kubo formula and Lorentz model for predicting the infrared dielectric function of polar materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of infrared dielectric functions in polar materials is fundamental for thermal and photonic applications, yet it remains unexplored whether the two main methods, Green-Kubo formula and Lorentz model, can give unified predictions. In this work, we present a detailed comparison of these two approaches using MgO and LiH as prototypical cases employing both empirical rigid ion model (RIM) and machine learning potential (MLP). We demonstrate that the conventional Lorentz model fails to capture the multi-phonon absorption inherent in Green-Kubo method, which can be resolved via using the phonon self-energy as a generalization of the usual linewidth. In addition, with RIM, a correction factor is required in the ionic contribution to infrared response to account for the electronic polarization effect, which is yet captured by MLP using the Born effective charges for calculating dipole moment. The present benchmark study thus enables cross-validation of dielectric function calculations while providing mechanistic insights into the polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Current phase relation in a planar graphene Josephson junction with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a graphene Josephson junction where the inner graphene layer is subjected to spin-orbit coupling by proximity effect. This could be achieved, for example, by growing the graphene layer on top of a transition metal dichalcogenide, such as WS$_2$. Here, we focus on the ballistic, wide, and short junction limits and study the effects of the spin-orbit interaction on the supercurrent. In particular, we analyze the current phase relation using an analytical approach based on the continuum model. We find combinations of types of spin-orbit coupling that significantly suppress the supercurrent by opening a gap in the graphene band structure. At the same time, other combinations enhance it, acting as an effective spin-valley resolved chemical potential. Moreover, we find that a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling leads to a junction with a highly voltage tunable harmonic content.</description>

      <title>THz Emission from Spintronic Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in spintronics have opened a new avenue in terahertz (THz) radiation sources that may outperform the traditional contact-based metallic counterparts. Inspired by the generation of broadband spintronic THz signals at the interface of a ferromagnet and ultrawide bandgap semiconductors, here we investigated the generation of THz radiation from micro-structured heterostructures of a metallic ferromagnet (Ni80Fe20) and an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor (AlGaN/GaN) that contains a layer of 2D electron gas. By precisely tailoring the dimension of the subwavelength pillars of a THz device, the micro-structured spintronic THz emitter can achieve up to more than three times higher emission intensity compared to that of the un-patterned counterpart. Our study advances the development of the next generation of spintronic THz sources that allow a tailored emission frequency and intensity control and, further, are compatible with existing integrated wide-bandgap semiconductor circuits.</description>

      <title>Bringing light into the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation: Consequences of its fractal non-Markovian memory kernel for optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.</description>

      <title>Zeptosecond free-electron compression through temporal lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of ever-shorter time scales is a frontier in modern physics, exemplified by the synthesis of attosecond light pulses -- an achievement made possible by coherently superimposing a broad range of photon energies, as required by the uncertainty principle. However, extending this progress into the zeptosecond regime poses significant challenges, as it demands phase-correlated optical spectra spanning hundreds of electronvolts. In this context, electrons offer a compelling alternative to light because they can be coherently manipulated to form broad energy superpositions, as demonstrated by the generation of attosecond pulses in ultrafast electron microscopes. Here, we propose a practical scheme for compressing free electrons into the zeptosecond domain by modulating their wave functions using suitably tailored broadband light fields. Building on recent advances in {free-electron--light--matter} interactions, our method introduces the concept of temporal lensing -- an extension of conventional optical lensing to the time domain -- to produce electron pulses with arbitrarily short durations.</description>

      <title>Demagnetization in micromagnetics: magnetostatic self-interactions of bulk chiral magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the magnetization in a ferromagnet induces an internal demagnetizing magnetic field. This, in-turn, generates a magnetostatic self-energy, coming from dipole-dipole interactions. In general, this energy is singular and intrinsically non-local. However, one can introduce a magnetic scalar potential associated with the demagnetizing field. We show that computation of the magnetic potential can be achieved by solving Poisson's equation where the source is the divergence of the magnetization. Furthermore, we determine the variation of the magnetostatic self-energy and its associated back-reaction on the magnetization. Then, we present a theoretical study of the effect of the long-range dipolar interaction on magnetic skyrmion textures in the bulk of chiral ferromagnetic materials with the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. It is observed that the demagnetizing dipolar self-interaction can stabilize antiskyrmion crystals in Heusler compounds.</description>

Abstract: Graphite occurs in a range of metastable stacking orders characterized by both the number and direction of shifts between adjacent layers by the length of a single carbon-carbon bond. At the extremes are Bernal (or ``ABAB...'') stacking, where the direction of the interlayer shift alternates with each layer, and rhombohedral (or ``ABCABC...'') stacking order where the shifts are always in the same direction. However, for an N-layer system, there are in principle $N-1$ unique metastable stacking orders of this type. Recently, it has become clear that stacking order has a strong effect on the low energy electronic band structure with single-layer shifts completely altering the electronic properties. Most experimental work has focused on the extremal stacking orders in large part due to the difficulty of isolating and identifying intermediate orders. Motivated by this challenge, here we describe two atomic force microscopy (AFM) based techniques to unambiguously distinguish stacking orders and defects in graphite flakes. Photo-thermal infrared atomic force microscope (AFM-IR) is able to distinguish stacking orders across multiple IR wavelengths and readily provides absolute contrast via IR spectral analysis. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) can distinguish the relative contrast between Bernal, intermediate and rhombohedral domains. We show that both techniques are well suited to characterizing graphite van der Waals devices, providing high contrast determination of stacking order, subsurface imaging of graphene flakes buried under a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer, and identifying nanoscale domain walls. Our results pave the way for the reliable fabrication of graphene multilayer devices of definite interlayer registry.</description>

      <title>Probing Bulk Band Topology from Time Boundary Effect in Synthetic Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An incident wave at a temporal interface, created by an abrupt change in system parameters, generates time-refracted and time-reflected waves. We find topological characteristics associated with the temporal interface that separates distinct spatial topologies and report a novel bulk-boundary correspondence for the temporal interface. The vanishing of either time refraction or time reflection records a topological phase transition across the temporal interface, and the difference of bulk band topology predicts nontrivial braiding hidden in the time refraction and time reflection coefficients. These findings, which are insensitive to spatial boundary conditions and robust against disorder, are demonstrated in a synthetic frequency lattice with rich topological phases engendered by long-range couplings. Our work reveals the topological aspect of temporal interface and paves the way for using the time boundary effect to probe topological phase transitions and topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Fluxoid Valve Effect in Full-Shell Nanowire Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or fluxoids that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full shell-nanowires are in topological superconducting regime.</description>

      <title>Leakage at zero temperature from changes in chemical potential in Majorana qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a fault-tolerant quantum computer requires physical qubits with exceptionally low error rates. Majorana-based tetron qubits are predicted to exhibit error rates that decrease exponentially with inverse temperature and length of each topological superconducting wire in the tetron. In contrast to this prediction, we show that errors arising from small variations in the chemical potential grow linearly with tetron length at zero temperature. These errors stem from leakage into excited quasiparticle states, which ultimately poison Majorana modes at opposite ends of the tetron, causing errors. We further demonstrate that the dynamics of this leakage is captured by the half Landau-Zener effect, which dictates its dependence on key system parameters such as the superconducting gap, chemical potential variations, and dynamic changes in the spatial profile of Majorana modes. These results motivate further investigations into the impact of leakage on qubit performance and potential mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring energy levels in quantum systems via Hamiltonian control parameters is essential for designing quantum thermodynamic devices and materials. However, conventional methods for manipulating finite-size systems, such as tuning external fields or system size, typically lead to uniform spectral shifts, limiting precise control. A recently introduced technique, called the size-invariant shape transformation, overcomes this by introducing a new control parameter that deforms the potential landscape without altering system size, enabling nonuniform level scaling. This shape parameter gives rise to quantum shape effects in confined systems, conceptually distinct from quantum size effects. We explore the limits of this phenomenon by asking: what is the minimal system in which such spectral behavior can emerge? We show that even a two-level system can exhibit thermodynamic consequences of quantum shape effects, including spontaneous transitions into lower-entropy states, a feature absent in classical thermodynamics for non-interacting systems. We identify the origin as geometry-induced asymmetric level coupling, where the ground-state energy and level spacing respond oppositely to shape changes. This extends to many-level systems, where the thermally averaged level spacing and ground-state energy evolve in opposite directions. We construct spontaneity maps revealing energy- and entropy-driven spontaneous processes. These behaviors emerge under quasistatic, isothermal deformations and show how geometry alone can induce thermodynamic effects typically exclusive to interacting or open systems. Our results offer a broadly applicable route to spectral gap control in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives birth to topological insulators that are robust against sufficiently weak randomness, inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation of a trivial insulation. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</description>

      <title>Effective Equilibrium Theory of Quantum Light-Matter Interaction in Cavities: Extended Systems and the Long Wavelength Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When light and matter interact strongly, the resulting hybrid system inherits properties from both constituents, allowing one to modify material behavior by engineering the surrounding electromagnetic environment. This concept underlies the emerging paradigm of cavity materials engineering, which aims at the control of material properties via tailored vacuum fluctuations of dark photonic environments. The theoretical description of such systems is challenging due to the combined complexity of extended electronic states and quantum electromagnetic fields. Here, we derive an effective, non-perturbative theory for low-dimensional crystals embedded in a Fabry-P\'erot resonator, within the long-wavelength limit. Our approach incorporates the multimode and dispersive nature of the cavity field and reduces it to an effective single-mode description by imposing the condition of negligible momentum transfer from light to matter. Importantly, the resulting effective mode is characterized by a finite mode volume-even in the limit of extended cavities-which is directly linked to realistic cavity parameters. This ensures that the light-matter coupling remains finite in bulk systems. By explicitly accounting for the finite reflectivity of cavity mirrors, our theory also avoids double counting the contribution from free-space light-matter coupling. Overall, our results provide a robust and realistic framework for describing cavity-matter interactions at the Hamiltonian level, incorporating the electromagnetic environment beyond the idealized perfect-mirror approximation.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e amplification of highly tunable shift current response in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the shift current conductivity in helical twisted trilayer graphene. Without loss of generality, we show that the density of states and the twist angle set an upper bound for this response, which is inversely proportional to the square of the twist angle. For the case of ABA stacking and at the magic angle, the shift photoconductivity can reach values of order $10^4~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ for frequencies below 50 meV, which can be attributed to the interband transitions between the two flattened middle bands close to the Fermi level. By tuning the twist angle, we demonstrate that the photoconductivity is shifted in the frequency range and it is further influenced by two additional factors: The magnitude of the shift vector and the energy separation between the bands. Furthermore, we propose a scenario in the AAA stacked configuration, where the photoconductivity can be of order $10^5~\mathrm{\mu A \cdot nm \cdot V}^{-2}$ in the THz regime, revealing a potential influence of the stacking in the optimization of the shift current conductivity. Therefore, a large density of states, a small twist angle and the layer stacking are ingredients that hold promising functionality for photovoltaic applications in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to investigate spin chirality in molecular quantum systems. Focusing on a minimal three-spin-center model with antiferromagnetic exchange and symmetry breaking driven by an electric-field-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and applied magnetic fields-give rise to chiral ground states characterized by nonzero scalar spin chirality, $\chi = \textbf{S}_1\cdot(\textbf{S}_r\times \textbf{S}_2)$. The emergent chiral qubits naturally suppress always-on interactions that can not be switched off in weakly coupled qubits, as demonstrated through Liouville-von Neumann dynamics, which reveal phase difference in superposition states that form chiral qubits. To validate this framework, we examine realistic lanthanide complexes with radical-bridged magnetic centers, where spin-orbit coupling and asymmetric exchange facilitate chirality. Our findings establish spin chirality engineering as a promising strategy for mitigating always-on interaction in entangling two chiral qubits in molecular quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

Abstract: We describe how to use quantum linear algebra to simulate a physically realistic model of disordered non-interacting electrons. The physics of disordered electrons outside of one dimension challenges classical computation due to the critical nature of the Anderson localization transition or the presence of large localization lengths, while the atypical distribution of the local density of states limits the power of disorder averaged approaches. Starting from the block-encoding of a disordered non-interacting Hamiltonian, we describe how to simulate key physical quantities, including the reduced density matrix, Green's function, and local density of states, as well as bulk-averaged observables such as the linear conductivity, using the quantum singular value transformation, quantum amplitude estimation, and trace estimation. We further discuss a quantum advantage that scales polynomially with system size and exponentially with lattice dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we analytically prove that the upper bound of the instantaneous power obtained through this system-charger duo scales quadratically with moderate system-size. By optimizing the driving frequency, we demonstrate that the maximum average power which is a lower bound of the instantaneous power can achieve the super-extensive scaling with system-size, thereby providing genuine quantum advantage. Further, we illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. We also discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

Abstract: This review examines the conditions that lead to the formation of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in thin films and core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. It also analyzes possible mechanisms by which the flexoelectric effect impacts the polarization structure in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles. Special attention is given to the role of the anisotropic flexoelectric effect in forming a unique type of polarization states with distinct chiral properties, referred to as "flexons". In the first part of the review, we study the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the polarity, chirality and branching of metastable labyrinthine domain structures in uniaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. We reveal that the transition from sinuous branched domain stripes to spiral-like domains occurs gradually as the flexoelectric coupling strength is increased. Our findings indicate that the joint action of flexoelectric effect and chemical strains, termed as "flexo-chemical" coupling, can significantly influence the effective Curie temperature, polarization distribution, domain morphology, and chirality in multiaxial ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of flexo-chemical coupling and screening effects leads to the appearance and stabilization of a chiral polarization morphology in nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectrics. In the second part of the review, we discuss several advanced applications of flexo-sensitive chiral polar structures in core-shell ferroelectric nanoparticles for nanoelectronics elements and cryptography. We underline the possibilities of the flexoelectric control of multiple-degenerated labyrinthine states, which may correspond to a differential negative capacitance (NC) state stabilized in the uniaxial ferroelectric core by the presence of a screening shell.</description>
