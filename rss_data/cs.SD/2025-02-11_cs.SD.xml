      <title>Aligner-Encoders: Self-Attention Transformers Can Be Self-Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern systems for automatic speech recognition, including the RNN-Transducer and Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED), are designed so that the encoder is not required to alter the time-position of information from the audio sequence into the embedding; alignment to the final text output is processed during decoding. We discover that the transformer-based encoder adopted in recent years is actually capable of performing the alignment internally during the forward pass, prior to decoding. This new phenomenon enables a simpler and more efficient model, the "Aligner-Encoder". To train it, we discard the dynamic programming of RNN-T in favor of the frame-wise cross-entropy loss of AED, while the decoder employs the lighter text-only recurrence of RNN-T without learned cross-attention -- it simply scans embedding frames in order from the beginning, producing one token each until predicting the end-of-message. We conduct experiments demonstrating performance remarkably close to the state of the art, including a special inference configuration enabling long-form recognition. In a representative comparison, we measure the total inference time for our model to be 2x faster than RNN-T and 16x faster than AED. Lastly, we find that the audio-text alignment is clearly visible in the self-attention weights of a certain layer, which could be said to perform "self-transduction".</description>

      <title>Koel-TTS: Enhancing LLM based Speech Generation with Preference Alignment and Classifier Free Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While autoregressive speech token generation models produce speech with remarkable variety and naturalness, their inherent lack of controllability often results in issues such as hallucinations and undesired vocalizations that do not conform to conditioning inputs. We introduce Koel-TTS, a suite of enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer TTS models that address these challenges by incorporating preference alignment techniques guided by automatic speech recognition and speaker verification models. Additionally, we incorporate classifier-free guidance to further improve synthesis adherence to the transcript and reference speaker audio. Our experiments demonstrate that these optimizations significantly enhance target speaker similarity, intelligibility, and naturalness of synthesized speech. Notably, Koel-TTS directly maps text and context audio to acoustic tokens, and on the aforementioned metrics, outperforms state-of-the-art TTS models, despite being trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Audio samples and demos are available on our website.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Expressive Voice Conversion with Discrete Pitch-Conditioned Flow Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces PFlow-VC, a conditional flow matching voice conversion model that leverages fine-grained discrete pitch tokens and target speaker prompt information for expressive voice conversion (VC). Previous VC works primarily focus on speaker conversion, with further exploration needed in enhancing expressiveness (such as prosody and emotion) for timbre conversion. Unlike previous methods, we adopt a simple and efficient approach to enhance the style expressiveness of voice conversion models. Specifically, we pretrain a self-supervised pitch VQVAE model to discretize speaker-irrelevant pitch information and leverage a masked pitch-conditioned flow matching model for Mel-spectrogram synthesis, which provides in-context pitch modeling capabilities for the speaker conversion model, effectively improving the voice style transfer capacity. Additionally, we improve timbre similarity by combining global timbre embeddings with time-varying timbre tokens. Experiments on unseen LibriTTS test-clean and emotional speech dataset ESD show the superiority of the PFlow-VC model in both timbre conversion and style transfer. Audio samples are available on the demo page https://speechai-demo.github.io/PFlow-VC/.</description>

      <title>IndexTTS: An Industrial-Level Controllable and Efficient Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have gradually become the mainstream in the industry due to their high naturalness and powerful zero-shot voice cloning capabilities.Here, we introduce the IndexTTS system, which is mainly based on the XTTS and Tortoise model. We add some novel improvements. Specifically, in Chinese scenarios, we adopt a hybrid modeling method that combines characters and pinyin, making the pronunciations of polyphonic characters and long-tail characters controllable. We also performed a comparative analysis of the Vector Quantization (VQ) with Finite-Scalar Quantization (FSQ) for codebook utilization of acoustic speech tokens. To further enhance the effect and stability of voice cloning, we introduce a conformer-based speech conditional encoder and replace the speechcode decoder with BigVGAN2. Compared with XTTS, it has achieved significant improvements in naturalness, content consistency, and zero-shot voice cloning. As for the popular TTS systems in the open-source, such as Fish-Speech, CosyVoice2, FireRedTTS and F5-TTS, IndexTTS has a relatively simple training process, more controllable usage, and faster inference speed. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of these systems. Our demos are available at https://index-tts.github.io.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Nonnegative Matrix Factorization For Cardiorespiratory Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study represents the first integration of large language models (LLMs) with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), marking a novel advancement in the source separation field. The LLM is employed in two unique ways: enhancing the separation results by providing detailed insights for disease prediction and operating in a feedback loop to optimize a fundamental frequency penalty added to the NMF cost function. We tested the algorithm on two datasets: 100 synthesized mixtures of real measurements, and 210 recordings of heart and lung sounds from a clinical manikin including both individual and mixed sounds, captured using a digital stethoscope. The approach consistently outperformed existing methods, demonstrating its potential to significantly enhance medical sound analysis for disease diagnostics.</description>

      <title>An adaptive filter bank based neural network approach for time delay estimation and speech enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delay estimation (TDE) plays a key role in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) using adaptive filter method. Considerable residual echo will be left if estimation error arises. Here, in this paper, we proposed an adaptive filter bank based neural network approach where the delay is estimated by a bank of adaptive filters with overlapped time scope, and all the energy of filter weights are concatenated and feed to a classification network. The index with maximal probability is chosen as the estimated delay. Based on this TDE, an AEC scheme is designed using a neural network for residual echo and noise suppression, and the optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA) algorithm is adopted to make it robust. Also, a robust automatic gain control (AGC) scheme with spectrum smoothing method is designed to amplify speech segments. Performance evaluations reveal that higher performance can be achieved for our scheme.</description>

      <title>Calibration of Multiple Asynchronous Microphone Arrays using Hybrid TDOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of acoustic sensing systems made of multiple asynchronous microphone arrays is essential for satisfactory performance in sound source localization and tracking. State-of-the-art calibration methods for this type of system rely on the time difference of arrival and direction of arrival measurements among the microphone arrays (denoted as TDOA-M and DOA, respectively). In this paper, to enhance calibration accuracy, we propose to incorporate the time difference of arrival measurements between adjacent sound events (TDOAS) with respect to the microphone arrays. More specifically, we propose a two-stage calibration approach, including an initial value estimation (IVE) procedure and the final joint optimization step. The IVE stage first initializes all parameters except for microphone array orientations, using hybrid TDOA (i.e., TDOAM and TDOA-S), odometer data from a moving robot carrying a speaker, and DOA. Subsequently, microphone orientations are estimated through the iterative closest point method. The final joint optimization step estimates multiple microphone array locations, orientations, time offsets, clock drift rates, and sound source locations simultaneously. Both simulation and experiment results show that for scenarios with low or moderate TDOA noise levels, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy. All code and data are available at https://github.com/AISLABsustech/Hybrid-TDOA-Multi-Calib.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Multi-Microphone Speaker Extraction Using Relative Transfer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-microphone method for extracting a desired speaker from a mixture involving multiple speakers and directional noise in a reverberant environment. In this work, we propose leveraging the instantaneous relative transfer function (RTF), estimated from a reference utterance recorded in the same position as the desired source. The effectiveness of the RTF-based spatial cue is compared with direction of arrival (DOA)-based spatial cue and the conventional spectral embedding. Experimental results in challenging acoustic scenarios demonstrate that using spatial cues yields better performance than the spectral-based cue and that the instantaneous RTF outperforms the DOA-based spatial cue.</description>

      <title>Automatic Identification of Samples in Hip-Hop Music via Multi-Loss Training and an Artificial Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling, the practice of reusing recorded music or sounds from another source in a new work, is common in popular music genres like hip-hop and rap. Numerous services have emerged that allow users to identify connections between samples and the songs that incorporate them, with the goal of enhancing music discovery. Designing a system that can perform the same task automatically is challenging, as samples are commonly altered with audio effects like pitch- and time-stretching and may only be seconds long. Progress on this task has been minimal and is further blocked by the limited availability of training data. Here, we show that a convolutional neural network trained on an artificial dataset can identify real-world samples in commercial hip-hop music. We extract vocal, harmonic, and percussive elements from several databases of non-commercial music recordings using audio source separation, and train the model to fingerprint a subset of these elements in transformed versions of the original audio. We optimize the model using a joint classification and metric learning loss and show that it achieves 13% greater precision on real-world instances of sampling than a fingerprinting system using acoustic landmarks, and that it can recognize samples that have been both pitch shifted and time stretched. We also show that, for half of the commercial music recordings we tested, our model is capable of locating the position of a sample to within five seconds.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Deep Audio Representations for Hearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively steering hearable devices requires understanding the acoustic environment around the user. In the computational analysis of sound scenes, foundation models have emerged as the state of the art to produce high-performance, robust, multi-purpose audio representations. We introduce and release Deep Evaluation of Audio Representations (DEAR), the first dataset and benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of foundation models in capturing essential acoustic properties for hearables. The dataset includes 1,158 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, created by spatially mixing proprietary monologues with commercial, high-quality recordings of everyday acoustic scenes. Our benchmark encompasses eight tasks that assess the general context, speech sources, and technical acoustic properties of the audio scenes. Through our evaluation of four general-purpose audio representation models, we demonstrate that the BEATs model significantly surpasses its counterparts. This superiority underscores the advantage of models trained on diverse audio collections, confirming their applicability to a wide array of auditory tasks, including encoding the environment properties necessary for hearable steering. The DEAR dataset and associated code are available at https://dear-dataset.github.io.</description>

      <title>Distillation and Pruning for Scalable Self-Supervised Representation-Based Speech Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate distillation and pruning methods to reduce model size for non-intrusive speech quality assessment based on self-supervised representations. Our experiments build on XLS-R-SQA, a speech quality assessment model using wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R embeddings. We retrain this model on a large compilation of mean opinion score datasets, encompassing over 100,000 labeled clips. For distillation, using this model as a teacher, we generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled degraded speech signals and train student models of varying sizes. For pruning, we use a data-driven strategy. While data-driven pruning performs better at larger model sizes, distillation on unlabeled data is more effective for smaller model sizes. Distillation can halve the gap between the baseline's correlation with ground-truth MOS labels and that of the XLS-R-based teacher model, while reducing model size by two orders of magnitude compared to the teacher model.</description>

      <title>Less is More for Synthetic Speech Detection in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by advances in self-supervised learning for speech, state-of-the-art synthetic speech detectors have achieved low error rates on popular benchmarks such as ASVspoof. However, prior benchmarks do not address the wide range of real-world variability in speech. Are reported error rates realistic in real-world conditions? To assess detector failure modes and robustness under controlled distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a benchmark with more than 3000 hours of synthetic speech from 7 domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. We found that all distribution shifts degraded model performance, and contrary to prior findings, training on more vocoders, speakers, or with data augmentation did not guarantee better generalization. In fact, we found that training on less diverse data resulted in better generalization, and that a detector fit using samples from a single carefully selected vocoder and a single speaker achieved state-of-the-art results on the challenging In-the-Wild benchmark.</description>

      <title>Audio-Visual Representation Learning via Knowledge Distillation from Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual representation learning is crucial for advancing multimodal speech processing tasks, such as lipreading and audio-visual speech recognition. Recently, speech foundation models (SFMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across various speech-related tasks. Building on this progress, we propose an audio-visual representation learning model that leverages cross-modal knowledge distillation from SFMs. In our method, SFMs serve as teachers, from which multi-layer hidden representations are extracted using clean audio inputs. We also introduce a multi-teacher ensemble method to distill the student, which receives audio-visual data as inputs. A novel representational knowledge distillation loss is employed to train the student during pretraining, which is also applied during finetuning to further enhance the performance on downstream tasks. Our experiments utilized both a self-supervised SFM, WavLM, and a supervised SFM, iFLYTEK-speech. The results demonstrated that our proposed method achieved superior or at least comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art baselines across automatic speech recognition, visual speech recognition, and audio-visual speech recognition tasks. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies and the visualization of learned representations were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the use of Performer and Agent Attention for Spoken Language Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the methods for language Identification (LID) involves deriving speech representation from pre-trained models using self-supervised learning, followed by fine-tuning the model for the LID task. State-of-the-art approaches for LID use an attention-based statistical pooling layer to facilitate the aggregation of contextual information across time frames of the embedding vectors extracted from the pre-trained model. In this paper, we delve into exploring recently proposed attention mechanisms, namely performer and agent-attention, in conjunction with the statistical pooling layer. The LID experiments are performed on three datasets: VoxPopuli, FLEURS, and VoxLingua. We compare their performance against vanilla self-attention. Our findings suggest that performer-attention outperforms self-attention and agent-attention exhibits comparable or occasionally superior performance to self-attention, while also being computationally less expensive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have demonstrated significant success in tasks such as visual captioning, question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, these models face inherent limitations due to their finite internal capacity, which restricts their ability to process extended temporal sequences, a crucial requirement for comprehensive video and audio analysis. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a specialized cognitive module, temporal working memory (TWM), which aims to enhance the temporal modeling capabilities of MFMs. It selectively retains task-relevant information across temporal dimensions, ensuring that critical details are preserved throughout the processing of video and audio content. The TWM uses a query-guided attention approach to focus on the most informative multimodal segments within temporal sequences. By retaining only the most relevant content, TWM optimizes the use of the model's limited capacity, enhancing its temporal modeling ability. This plug-and-play module can be easily integrated into existing MFMs. With our TWM, nine state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance improvements across tasks such as video captioning, question answering, and video-text retrieval. By enhancing temporal modeling, TWM extends the capability of MFMs to handle complex, time-sensitive data effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/xid32/NAACL_2025_TWM.</description>

      <title>Improved Extrinsic Calibration of Acoustic Cameras via Batch Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic cameras have found many applications in practice. Accurate and reliable extrinsic calibration of the microphone array and visual sensors within acoustic cameras is crucial for fusing visual and auditory measurements. Existing calibration methods either require prior knowledge of the microphone array geometry or rely on grid search which suffers from slow iteration speed or poor convergence. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose an automatic calibration technique using a calibration board with both visual and acoustic markers to identify each microphone position in the camera frame. We formulate the extrinsic calibration problem (between microphones and the visual sensor) as a nonlinear least squares problem and employ a batch optimization strategy to solve the associated problem. Extensive numerical simulations and realworld experiments show that the proposed method improves both the accuracy and robustness of extrinsic parameter calibration for acoustic cameras, in comparison to existing methods. To benefit the community, we open-source all the codes and data at https://github.com/AISLAB-sustech/AcousticCamera.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.</description>

      <title>Learning Musical Representations for Music Performance Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music performances are representative scenarios for audio-visual modeling. Unlike common scenarios with sparse audio, music performances continuously involve dense audio signals throughout. While existing multimodal learning methods on the audio-video QA demonstrate impressive capabilities in general scenarios, they are incapable of dealing with fundamental problems within the music performances: they underexplore the interaction between the multimodal signals in performance and fail to consider the distinctive characteristics of instruments and music. Therefore, existing methods tend to answer questions regarding musical performances inaccurately. To bridge the above research gaps, (i) given the intricate multimodal interconnectivity inherent to music data, our primary backbone is designed to incorporate multimodal interactions within the context of music; (ii) to enable the model to learn music characteristics, we annotate and release rhythmic and music sources in the current music datasets; (iii) for time-aware audio-visual modeling, we align the model's music predictions with the temporal dimension. Our experiments show state-of-the-art effects on the Music AVQA datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/xid32/Amuse.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Speech Restoration with Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional speech enhancement methods often oversimplify the task of restoration by focusing on a single type of distortion. Generative models that handle multiple distortions frequently struggle with phone reconstruction and high-frequency harmonics, leading to breathing and gasping artifacts that reduce the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. These models are also computationally demanding, and many solutions are restricted to producing outputs in the wide-band frequency range, which limits their suitability for professional applications. To address these challenges, we propose Hi-ResLDM, a novel generative model based on latent diffusion designed to remove multiple distortions and restore speech recordings to studio quality, sampled at 48kHz. We benchmark Hi-ResLDM against state-of-the-art methods that leverage GAN and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) components, demonstrating superior performance in regenerating high-frequency-band details. Hi-ResLDM not only excels in non-instrusive metrics but is also consistently preferred in human evaluation and performs competitively on intrusive evaluations, making it ideal for high-resolution speech restoration.</description>

      <title>LC-Protonets: Multi-Label Few-Shot Learning for World Music Audio Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Label-Combination Prototypical Networks (LC-Protonets) to address the problem of multi-label few-shot classification, where a model must generalize to new classes based on only a few available examples. Extending Prototypical Networks, LC-Protonets generate one prototype per label combination, derived from the power set of labels present in the limited training items, rather than one prototype per label. Our method is applied to automatic audio tagging across diverse music datasets, covering various cultures and including both modern and traditional music, and is evaluated against existing approaches in the literature. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement in almost all domains and training setups when using LC-Protonets for multi-label classification. In addition to training a few-shot learning model from scratch, we explore the use of a pre-trained model, obtained via supervised learning, to embed items in the feature space. Fine-tuning improves the generalization ability of all methods, yet LC-Protonets achieve high-level performance even without fine-tuning, in contrast to the comparative approaches. We finally analyze the scalability of the proposed method, providing detailed quantitative metrics from our experiments. The implementation and experimental setup are made publicly available, offering a benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>CleanUMamba: A Compact Mamba Network for Speech Denoising using Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents CleanUMamba, a time-domain neural network architecture designed for real-time causal audio denoising directly applied to raw waveforms. CleanUMamba leverages a U-Net encoder-decoder structure, incorporating the Mamba state-space model in the bottleneck layer. By replacing conventional self-attention and LSTM mechanisms with Mamba, our architecture offers superior denoising performance while maintaining a constant memory footprint, enabling streaming operation. To enhance efficiency, we applied structured channel pruning, achieving an 8X reduction in model size without compromising audio quality. Our model demonstrates strong results in the Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression challenge. Specifically, CleanUMamba achieves a PESQ score of 2.42 and STOI of 95.1% with only 442K parameters and 468M MACs, matching or outperforming larger models in real-time performance. Code will be available at: https://github.com/lab-emi/CleanUMamba</description>

      <title>ImmerseDiffusion: A Generative Spatial Audio Latent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ImmerseDiffusion, an end-to-end generative audio model that produces 3D immersive soundscapes conditioned on the spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions of sound objects. ImmerseDiffusion is trained to generate first-order ambisonics (FOA) audio, which is a conventional spatial audio format comprising four channels that can be rendered to multichannel spatial output. The proposed generative system is composed of a spatial audio codec that maps FOA audio to latent components, a latent diffusion model trained based on various user input types, namely, text prompts, spatial, temporal and environmental acoustic parameters, and optionally a spatial audio and text encoder trained in a Contrastive Language and Audio Pretraining (CLAP) style. We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the generated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of generation quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes: ``descriptive", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric", which uses non-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate promising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect reliable spatial fidelity.</description>

      <title>NBM: an Open Dataset for the Acoustic Monitoring of Nocturnal Migratory Birds in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlights the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that a two-stage object detection model, tailored for the processing of audio data, can be trained on our dataset to retrieve localized bounding box coordinates around each signal of interest in a spectrogram. This object detection approach, which is largely overlooked in the bird sound recognition literature, allows important applications by potentially differentiating individual birds within audio windows. Further, we show that the accuracy of our recognition model on the 45 main species of the dataset competes with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger datasets. This highlights the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.</description>

      <title>XAttnMark: Learning Robust Audio Watermarking with Cross-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative audio synthesis and editing technologies has raised significant concerns about copyright infringement, data provenance, and the spread of misinformation through deepfake audio. Watermarking offers a proactive solution by embedding imperceptible, identifiable, and traceable marks into audio content. While recent neural network-based watermarking methods like WavMark and AudioSeal have improved robustness and quality, they struggle to achieve both robust detection and accurate attribution simultaneously. This paper introduces Cross-Attention Robust Audio Watermark (XAttnMark), which bridges this gap by leveraging partial parameter sharing between the generator and the detector, a cross-attention mechanism for efficient message retrieval, and a temporal conditioning module for improved message distribution. Additionally, we propose a psychoacoustic-aligned temporal-frequency masking loss that captures fine-grained auditory masking effects, enhancing watermark imperceptibility. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection and attribution, demonstrating superior robustness against a wide range of audio transformations, including challenging generative editing with strong editing strength.

      <title>uDistil-Whisper: Label-Free Data Filtering for Knowledge Distillation in Low-Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation using pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare with and filter low-quality examples, making the process dependent on human labels. Additionally, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. To address this, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best-distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 WER points and are on par with or outperform similar supervised data filtering setups. When scaling the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. Our models are also 25-50% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.

      <title>Wavelet GPT: Wavelet Inspired Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure. This paper infuses LLMs with a traditional signal processing idea, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture in an academic setup, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, audio, and images. This is done by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Further, we show this extends to the Long Range Arena benchmark and several input representations such as characters, BPE tokens, bytes, waveform, math expression, and image pixels. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every decoder block. We hope this will pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing into pre-training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The auto-regressive architecture, like GPTs, is widely used in modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. However, it incurs substantial inference time, particularly due to the challenges in the next-token prediction posed by lengthy sequences of speech tokens. In this work, we introduce VADUSA, one of the first approaches to accelerate auto-regressive TTS through speculative decoding. Our results show that VADUSA not only significantly improves inference speed but also enhances performance by incorporating draft heads to predict future speech content auto-regressively. Furthermore, the inclusion of a tolerance mechanism during sampling accelerates inference without compromising quality. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across large datasets and various types of speech tokens.</description>

      <title>Prepending or Cross-Attention for Speech-to-Text? An Empirical Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, there is increasing interest in extending their capabilities to speech -- the most common form of communication. The most widespread approach to integrating speech into LLMs is dense feature prepending (DFP), which prepends the projected speech representations to the textual representations, allowing end-to-end training with a speech encoder. This raises questions about the need for a sophisticated speech encoder for DFP and how its performance compares with a standard encoder-decoder (i.e., cross-attention) architecture. We compare DFP and cross-attention under a variety of configurations, such as CTC compression, sequence-level knowledge distillation, on monolingual, bilingual, and multilingual models. To perform a controlled architectural comparison, we train all models from scratch rather than using large pretrained models and use comparable data and parameter settings, testing speech-to-text recognition (ASR) and translation (ST) on MuST-C v1.0 and CoVoST2 datasets. Despite the wide adoption of DFP, our results do not indicate a clear advantage of DFP over cross-attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual assistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive emotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.</description>

Abstract: As a natural multimodal content, audible video delivers an immersive sensory experience. Consequently, audio-video generation systems have substantial potential. However, existing diffusion-based studies mainly employ relatively independent modules for generating each modality, which lack exploration of shared-weight generative modules. This approach may under-use the intrinsic correlations between audio and visual modalities, potentially resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose UniForm, a unified diffusion transformer designed to enhance cross-modal consistency. By concatenating auditory and visual information, UniForm learns to generate audio and video simultaneously within a unified latent space, facilitating the creation of high-quality and well-aligned audio-visual pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in joint audio-video generation, audio-guided video generation, and video-guided audio generation tasks. Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/.</description>
