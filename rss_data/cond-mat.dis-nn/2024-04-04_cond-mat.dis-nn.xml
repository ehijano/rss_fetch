      <title>Critical Properties of Weak Measurement Induced Phase Transitions in Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of different forms of weak measurements on the nature of the measurement induced phase transition are theoretically studied in hybrid random quantum circuits of qubits. We use a combination of entanglement measures, ancilla purification dynamics, and a transfer matrix approach to compute the critical exponents, the effective central charge, and the multifractal spectrum of the measurement induced transitions. We compare weak measurements with an infinite number of discrete outcomes to a protocol with only a pair of outcomes and find that to within our numerical accuracy the universal critical properties are unaffected by the weak measurement protocols and are consistent with the universality class found for strong projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport, metal-insulator transition, and Wigner crystallization in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two recent electronic transport experiments from Columbia University and Harvard University have reported record high mobility and low channel densities in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$ monolayers [J. Pack, et al., arXiv:2310.19782; A. Y. Joe, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 056303 (2024)]. A two-dimensional (2D) metal-insulator transition (MIT) is demonstrated in the Columbia sample at low densities, a regime where the formation of a Wigner crystal (WC) is theoretically anticipated in the absence of disorder. We employ the finite-temperature Boltzmann theory to understand the low-temperature transport properties of monolayer TMDs, taking into account realistic disorder scattering. We analyze the experimental results, focusing on the 2D MIT behavior and the influence of temperature and density on mobility and resistivity in the metallic phase. We provide a discussion of the nontrivial carrier density dependence of our transport results. Our analysis elucidates the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the metallic phase, attributing it to Friedel oscillations associated with screened charged impurities. Furthermore, we explore whether Coulomb disorder could lead to the MIT through either a quantum Anderson localization transition or a classical percolation transition. Our theoretical estimates of the disorder-induced MIT critical densities, although smaller, are within a factor of ~2 of the experimental critical density. We examine the exceptionally high melting temperature ~10 K of WCs observed experimentally in the MoSe$_2$ systems at low density, an order of magnitude larger than the pristine melting temperature. This suggests that the observed 2D low-density MIT behavior is likely a result of the complex interplay between disorder effects and interaction-driven WC physics, offering a comprehensive understanding of the low-temperature transport phenomena in TMD monolayers.</description>

      <title>Mapping of attention mechanisms to a generalized Potts model</title>

Abstract: Transformers are neural networks that revolutionized natural language processing and machine learning. They process sequences of inputs, like words, using a mechanism called self-attention, which is trained via masked language modeling (MLM). In MLM, a word is randomly masked in an input sequence, and the network is trained to predict the missing word. Despite the practical success of transformers, it remains unclear what type of data distribution self-attention can learn efficiently. Here, we show analytically that if one decouples the treatment of word positions and embeddings, a single layer of self-attention learns the conditionals of a generalized Potts model with interactions between sites and Potts colors. Moreover, we show that training this neural network is exactly equivalent to solving the inverse Potts problem by the so-called pseudo-likelihood method, well known in statistical physics. Using this mapping, we compute the generalization error of self-attention in a model scenario analytically using the replica method.</description>

      <title>Effect of Synaptic Heterogeneity on Neuronal Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in measurement techniques have resulted in an increasing amount of data on neural activities recorded in parallel, revealing largely heterogeneous correlation patterns across neurons. Yet, the mechanistic origin of this heterogeneity is largely unknown because existing theoretical approaches linking structure and dynamics in neural circuits are restricted to population-averaged connectivity and activity. Here we present a systematic inclusion of heterogeneity in network connectivity to derive quantitative predictions for neuron-resolved covariances and their statistics in spiking neural networks. Our study shows that the heterogeneity in covariances is not a result of variability in single-neuron firing statistics but stems from the ubiquitously observed sparsity and variability of connections in brain networks. Linear-response theory maps these features to the effective connectivity between neurons, which in turn determines neuronal covariances. Beyond-mean-field tools reveal that synaptic heterogeneity modulates the variability of covariances and thus the complexity of neuronal coordination across many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A replica analysis of Self-Training of Linear Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-training (ST) is a simple and standard approach in semi-supervised learning that has been applied to many machine learning problems. Despite its widespread acceptance and practical effectiveness, it is still not well understood why and how ST improves performance by fitting the model to potentially erroneous pseudo-labels. To investigate the properties of ST, in this study, we derive and analyze a sharp characterization of the behavior of iterative ST when training a linear classifier by minimizing the ridge-regularized convex loss for binary Gaussian mixtures, in the asymptotic limit where input dimension and data size diverge proportionally. The derivation is based on the replica method of statistical mechanics. The result indicates that, when the total number of iterations is large, ST may find a classification plane with the optimal direction regardless of the label imbalance by accumulating small parameter updates over long iterations. It is argued that this is because the small update of ST can accumulate information of the data in an almost noiseless way. However, when a label imbalance is present in true labels, the performance of the ST is significantly lower than that of supervised learning with true labels, because the ratio between the norm of the weight and the magnitude of the bias can become significantly large. To overcome the problems in label imbalanced cases, several heuristics are introduced. By numerically analyzing the asymptotic formula, it is demonstrated that with the proposed heuristics, ST can find a classifier whose performance is nearly compatible with supervised learning using true labels even in the presence of significant label imbalance.</description>

      <title>General theory of the viscosity of liquids and solids from nonaffine particle motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic formula for the viscosity of liquids and solids is derived rigorously from a first-principles (microscopically reversible) Hamiltonian for particle-bath atomistic motion. The derivation is done within the framework of nonaffine linear response theory. The new formula may lead to a valid alternative to the Green-Kubo approach to describe the viscosity of condensed matter systems from molecular simulations without having to fit long-time tails. Furthermore, it provides a direct link between the viscosity, the vibrational density of states of the system, and the zero-frequency limit of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Exact Mazur bounds in the pair-flip model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By mapping the calculation of Mazur bounds to the enumeration of walks on fractal structures, we present exact bounds on the late-time behavior of spin autocorrelation functions in models exhibiting pair-flip dynamics and more general $p$-flip dynamics. While the pair-flip model is known to exhibit strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the effect of its nontrivial conservation laws on autocorrelation functions has, thus far, only been calculated numerically, which has led to incorrect conclusions about their thermodynamic behavior. Here, using exact results, we prove that infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions exhibit infinite coherence times at the boundary, and that bulk Mazur bounds decay asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{L}$, rather than $1/L$, as had previously been thought. This result implies that the nontrivial conserved operators implied by $p$-flip dynamics have an important qualitative impact on bulk thermalization properties beyond the constraints imposed by the simple global symmetries of the models.</description>

      <title>Parisi's hypercube, Fock-space fluxes, and the microscopics of near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parisi's hypercube model describes a charged particle hopping on a $d$-dimensional hypercube with disordered background fluxes in the large $d$ limit. It was noted previously [Jia and Verbaarschot, J. High Energy Phys. 11 (2020) 154] that the hypercube model at leading order in $1/d$ has the same spectral density as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model. In this work we identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the DS-SYK model, demonstrating that the hypercube model is an equally good microscopic model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_1$ holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube model is not $p$-local. Rather, we note that the shared feature between the two models is that they both have a large amount of disordered but uniform fluxes on their Fock-space graphs, and we propose this is a broader characterization of near-CFT$_1$ microscopics. Moreover, we suggest that the hypercube model can be viewed as the operator growth model of the DS-SYK model. We explain some universality in subleading corrections and relate them to bulk vertices. Finally, we revise a claim made the aforementioned reference about the existence of a spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization and Quantum Chaos via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong local disorder in interacting quantum spin chains can turn delocalized eigenmodes into localized eigenstates, giving rise to many-body localized (MBL) phases. This is accompanied by distinct spectral statistics: chaotic for the delocalized phase and integrable for the localized phase. In isolated systems, localization and chaos are defined through a web of relations among eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and real-time dynamics. These may change as the system is made open. We ask whether random dissipation (without random disorder) can induce chaotic or localized behavior in an otherwise integrable system. The dissipation is described using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which can effectively be obtained from Markovian dynamics conditioned on null measurement. Through the use of the singular value decomposition and the introduction of new diagnostic tools complementing the singular-value statistics, namely, the singular form factor, the inverse participation ratio, and entanglement entropy for singular vectors, we provide a positive answer. Our method is illustrated in an XXZ Hamiltonian with random local dissipation.</description>

      <title>Memory formation in dense persistent active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protocol-dependent states in structural glasses can encode a disordered, yet retrievable memory. While training such materials is typically done via a global drive, such as external shear, in dense active matter the driving is instead local and spatio-temporally correlated. Here we focus on the impact of such spatial correlation on memory formation. We investigate the mechanical response of a dense amorphous packing of athermal particles, subject to an oscillatory quasistatic driving with a tunable spatial correlation, akin to the instantaneous driving pattern in active matter. We find that the capacity to encode memory can be rendered comparable upon a proper rescaling on the spatial correlation, whereas the efficiency in memory formation increases with motion cooperativity.</description>
