      <title>Overparametrization bends the landscape: BBP transitions at initialization in simple Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional non-convex loss landscapes play a central role in the theory of Machine Learning. Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with gradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed light on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus on a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase Retrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized settings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the Hessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) transition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the initialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a teacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can bend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the information-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization limit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between continuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical predictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N behavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N corrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates for a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization becomes entirely uninformative.</description>

      <title>Large deviations in the many-body localization transition: The case of the random-field XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of rare system-wide resonances in the many-body localization (MBL) transition has recently attracted significant attention. They are expected to play a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the development of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their statistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field disordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission amplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply it to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier, which formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the influence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators, we identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading in Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by rare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase where such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size phase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the Anderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based on real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even infinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite disorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction strengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space graph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral probes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes stems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and shorter-ranged deep in the localized phase.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for tensor factorization by sparse sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the tensor components. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting. We also develop a replica theory, which becomes exact in the dense limit,to examine the performance of statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum learning in proximity to universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In a monitored quantum circuit, regarded as a quantum channel, extensive and positive coherent information is sustained at low measurement rates, protected by the scrambling dynamics. However, noise suppresses coherent information, driving it to zero or negative values. Here, we show that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations facilitates reliable quantum information transmission even in the presence of noise, as evidenced by a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. We provide both analytical understanding and numerical evidence demonstrating this transition, which is modulated by the relative frequencies of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. Additionally, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition in experiments, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum circuit. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and non-Gaussian diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out of the equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this paper, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha &gt; 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.</description>
