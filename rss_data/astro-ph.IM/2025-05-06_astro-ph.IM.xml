      <title>Using Active Learning to Improve Quasar Identification for the DESI Spectra Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey uses an automatic spectral classification pipeline to classify spectra. QuasarNET is a convolutional neural network used as part of this pipeline originally trained using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In this paper we implement an active learning algorithm to optimally select spectra to use for training a new version of the QuasarNET weights file using only DESI data, specifically to improve classification accuracy. This active learning algorithm includes a novel outlier rejection step using a Self-Organizing Map to ensure we label spectra representative of the larger quasar sample observed in DESI. We perform two iterations of the active learning pipeline, assembling a final dataset of 5600 labeled spectra, a small subset of the approx 1.3 million quasar targets in DESI's Data Release 1. When splitting the spectra into training and validation subsets we meet or exceed the previously trained weights file in completeness and purity calculated on the validation dataset with less than one tenth of the amount of training data. The new weights also more consistently classify objects in the same way when used on unlabeled data compared to the old weights file. In the process of improving QuasarNET's classification accuracy we discovered a systemic error in QuasarNET's redshift estimation and used our findings to improve our understanding of QuasarNET's redshifts.</description>

      <title>Aerosol Measurement in B, V, and R Filters using Wide-field Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new method for aerosol measurement using wide-field stellar photometry was originally developed for B-filter data. The dependence of VAOD (vertical aerosol optical depth) on wavelength can be used to understand the physical characteristics of aerosol. The method has been extended for V and R filters using the Gaia stellar photometric catalog as the reference. We calculated the coefficients of the equation describing molecular and aerosol extinction of the atmosphere. For data in a particular filter, they depend on the telescope's location. Light towards shorter wavelengths has higher extinction. The VAOD, calculated in B, V, and R filters does not show monotonous dependence on wavelength, and there is increased dependence on the photometric methods for V and R filters. We studied the possible reasons for this unexpected behavior.</description>

      <title>Improving source positions in the OCARS catalog: A first approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OCARS (Optical Characteristics of Astrometric Radio Sources) is a compiled catalog of various additional data associated with astrometric radio sources whose coordinates have been determined from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. It contains source coordinates, object type, redshift, optical and near-infrared magnitudes. Until now, OCARS source coordinates were simply copied from input catalogs and, as a result, were systematically inhomogeneous. This work is the first attempt to obtain a unified set of radio source coordinates aligned to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), more specically to the third ICRF release, ICRF3. Comparison of the source coordinates in the old OCARS version as of December 2024 and the new OCARS version as of March 2025 with the ICRF3-SX catalog using the vector spherical harmonics (VSH) technique showed almost complete elimination of systematic errors in new OCARS positions relative to the ICRF3 frame.</description>

      <title>Comparative Biosignatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST is revealing potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres, though their presence is yet to provide strong evidence for life. The central challenge is attribution: how to confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially regarding system-scale stochastic processes that could set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing atmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically define the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for biosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic parameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving star, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from the baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin. We present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in explaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density as a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic counterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative biosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an "unknown unknown" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or life as we don't yet know it.</description>

      <title>Identifying Doppelganger Active Galactic Nuclei across redshifts from spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.</description>

Abstract: In the Brief History of Time Stephen Hawking was pessimistic about astronomers detecting primordial black holes (PBHs). He would not be the only distinguished scientist to underestimate the extraordinary power of new technology. In a related area Albert Einstein published the equations for microlensing, but wrote off their practicality. Perhaps they meant "during my lifetime." The amazing properties of PBHs, however, validate heroic efforts to detect them. If they exist, their niches in our current history of time include supplying dark matter to bind galaxies, offering a solution for the Hubble tension, and, as supermassive black holes, giving us quasars as far as the eye can see. This Research Note describes a search for PBHs in the Gaia archive. In spite of the high density of local dark matter, it was unsuccessful. Microlensing with the Rubin telescope is the tool at our disposal to open the asteroid window for PBH.</description>

      <title>Classifying and characterizing the evolution of minimum orbit intersection distance for near-Earth asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the minimum orbit intersection distances (MOIDs) of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) over the next 200 years were computed and analyzed in detail. It was shown that the MOID of a NEA relative to the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB) is usually a superior metric for predicting a potential impact than that relative to the Earth. Subsequently, a novel MOID Evolution Index (MEI) spanning from 0.0 to 9.9 was proposed and the orbits of NEAs are classified into 100 distinct categories by considering the variations of the MOID over time, which is useful for quickly screening and prioritizing hazardous asteroids for future research. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a linear fitting to the MOID evolution provides a simple yet valid approach for most of the NEAs, which is useful for quickly estimating the MOID value without the need to perform an orbit propagation. As a result, a scheme with several parameters was proposed to characterize the MOID variations as well as the relative position information of the critical points along the orbits associated with the minimum distances. A database incorporating these parameters and the MEI values was therefore established for the cataloged NEAs, enabling the derivation of statistically constrained upper bounds for secular MOID drift rate as function of the semi-major axes. Finally, some special orbital configurations and dynamical mechanisms that may lead to a large deviation from the linear fit or multiple orbit crossings were also investigated, indicating the intricate nature in the patterns of MOID evolution for some NEAs.</description>

      <title>RVSNUpy: A Python Package for Spectroscopic Redshift Measurement Based on Cross-Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RVSNUpy, a new Python package designed to measure spectroscopic redshifts. Based on inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation, RVSNUpy determines the redshifts by comparing observed spectra with various rest-frame template spectra. We test the performance of RVSNUpy based on ~ 6000 objects in the HectoMAP redshift survey observed with both SDSS and MMT/Hectospec. We demonstrate that a slight redshift offset (~ 40 km/s) between SDSS and MMT/Hectospec measurements reported from previous studies results from the small offsets in the redshift template spectra used for SDSS and Hectospec reductions. We construct the universal set of template spectra, including empirical SDSS template spectra, carefully calibrated to the rest frame. Our test for the HectoMAP objects with duplicated observations shows that RVSNUpy with the universal template spectra yields the homogeneous redshift from the spectra obtained with different spectrographs. We highlight that RVSNUpy is a powerful redshift measurement tool for current and future large-scale spectroscopy surveys, including A-SPEC, DESI, 4MOST, and Subaru/PFS.</description>

      <title>DeepHMC : a deep-neural-network acclerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for binary neutron star parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep neural network (DNN) accelerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm called DeepHMC for the inference of binary neutron star systems. The HMC is a non-random walk sampler that uses background gradient information to accelerate the convergence of the sampler. While faster converging than a random-walk sampler, in theory by a factor of the dimensionality of the problem, a known computational bottleneck for HMC algorithms is the calculation of gradients of the log-likelihood. We demonstrate that Hamiltonian trajectories based on a DNN gradients are 30 times faster than those based on the relative binning gradients, and 7000 times faster than trajectories based on a naive likelihood gradient calculation. Using the publicly available 128 second LVK data set for the binary neutron star mergers GW170817 and GW190425, we show that not only does DeepHMC produce produces highly accurate and consistent results with the LVK public data, but acquires 5000 statistically independent samples (SIS) in the $12D$ parameter space in approximately two hours on a Macbook pro for GW170817, with a cost of $&lt;1$ second/SIS, and 2.5 days for GW190425, with a cost of $\sim25$ seconds/SIS.</description>

      <title>Measuring Interstellar Carbon Abundance via 158 um [CII] Absorption with SOFIA -- A Potential Detection, and Proof-of-Concept for Depletion Studies with Future Far-IR Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared. We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption. We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along a significant number of sightlines.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers help us perform parameter estimation of overlapping signals in gravitational wave detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overlapping signals represent one of the major data analysis challenges in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We leverage Transformers and Normalizing Flows, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, to address the parameter estimation of overlapping binary black hole mergers in the Einstein Telescope (ET). Our proposed model combines a Transformer-based "Knowledge Extractor Neural Network" (KENN) with a Normalizing Flow (HYPERION) to perform rapid and unbiased inference over multiple overlapping black hole binary events. The choice of architecture leverages the strength of Transformers in capturing complex and long-range temporal structures in the strain time series data, while Normalizing Flows provide a powerful framework to sample posterior distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model over simulated gravitational wave signals, showing that it maintains the same level of accuracy regardless of the correlation level in the data. Moreover our model provides estimates of chirp mass and coalescence times within &lt;10-20% from the true simulated value. The results obtained are promising and show how this approach might represent a first step toward a deep-learning based inference pipeline for ET and other future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). IV. Synergy between astrometry and direct imaging missions of the Habitable World Observatory for detecting Earth-like planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and characterization of habitable planets around nearby stars persist as one of the foremost objectives in contemporary astrophysics. This work investigates the synergistic integration of astrometric and direct imaging techniques by capitalizing on the complementary capabilities of the Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) and Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Planetary brightness and position vary over time due to phase effects and orbital architectures, information that can be precisely provided by CHES's astrometric measurements. By combining the precise orbital constraints from CHES with the imaging capabilities of HWO, we evaluate the improvements in detection efficiency, signal-to-noise ratio and overall planet yield. Completeness is quantified as the fraction of injected planets that are successfully detected, while yields are estimated for various scenarios using terrestrial planet occurrence rates derived from the Kepler dataset. Our results indicate that prior astrometric data significantly enhance detection efficiency. Under the adopted detection limit, our analysis indicates that prior CHES observations can increase completeness by approximately 10% and improve detection efficiency by factors ranging from two to thirty. The findings underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the search for and characterization of habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>FRAM Next Generation at the Pierre Auger Observatory: cloud monitoring in the age of CMOS cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visibility of stars is often used for cloud detection using all-sky cameras, which have however only a limited reach and resolution near the horizon due to the lack of detectable stars. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, it is also used by the current generation of FRAM robotic telescopes, but -- due to their limited field of view -- only for a small number of selected showers. Thanks to the recent development in astronomical CMOS cameras, we are able to propose a new type of device, specifically tailored to the field of view of the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The sub-second readout times available with CMOS cameras allows the efficient use of short exposures, and so the field of view of one FD can be covered within half a minute with a resolution and reach sufficient to detect small clouds with a setup that is significantly smaller, simpler and cheaper than the current FRAMs. The FRAM Next Generation (framNG) device will be able not only to detect clouds, but also to assess their optical thickness, provide information on aerosol extinction, sky brightness and possibly even record atmospheric phenomena and astrophysical transients. The main challenge lies in the large data volume produced which necessitates reliable real-time data processing.</description>

      <title>A meta-analysis of impact factors of astrophysics journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors for the 38 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature, etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere: Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <title>Capivara: A Spectral-based Segmentation Method for IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present capivara, a fast and scalable spectral-based segmentation package designed to study astrophysical properties within distinct structural components of galaxies. This spectro-segmentation code for integral field unit (IFU) data provides a holistic view of galactic structure, moving beyond conventional radial gradients and the bulge-plus-disk dichotomy. It enables detailed comparisons of stellar ages and metallicities across components, and naturally identifies outliers by grouping spaxels according to dominant spectral features. The algorithm leverages Torch's scalability and GPU acceleration, outputting a masked FITS file that assigns each pixel to its respective group and generates the corresponding one-dimensional spectrum per group, without relying on Voronoi binning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method using a sample of MaNGA galaxies, combining capivara segmentation with the starlight spectral fitting code to derive stellar population and ionized gas properties. The method effectively identifies regions with similar spectral properties across both continuum and emission lines. By aggregating the spectra of these regions, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the analysis while preserving the spectral coherence within each group. capivara is released under an MIT license and is available at https://github.com/RafaelSdeSouza/capivara.</description>
