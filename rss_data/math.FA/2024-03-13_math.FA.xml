      <title>Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality via a new pointwise estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a new type of pointwise estimate of the Kalamajska-Mazya-Shaposhnikova type, where sparse averaging operators replace the maximal operator. It allows us to extend the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality to all rearrangement invariant Banach function spaces without any assumptions on their upper Boyd index, i.e. omitting problems caused by unboundedness of maximal operator on spaces close to $L^1$. In particular, we remove unnecessary assumptions from the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in the setting of Orlicz and Lorentz spaces. The applied method is new in this context and may be seen as a kind of sparse domination technique fitted to the context of rearrangement invariant Banach function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-standard version of Egorov's algebra of generalized functions, with improved properties of the generalized scalars and embedding of the Schwartz distributions compared with the original standard Egorov's version. The embedding of distributions is similar to, but different from author's works in the past and independently done by Hans Vernaeve.</description>

      <title>Norms in sinogram space and stability estimates for the Radon transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different norms for the Radon transform $Rf$ of a function $f$ and investigate under which conditions they can be estimated from above or below by some standard norms for $f$. We define Fourier-based norms for $Rf$ that can be related to Bessel-potential space norms for $f$. Furthermore, we define a variant of a total-variation norm for $Rf$ and provide conditions under which it is equivalent to the total-variation norm of $f$. As an illustration of potential applications of these results, we propose a novel nonlinear backprojection method for inverting the Radon transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aimed to introduce the concept of harmonically m-concave set-valued functions, which is obtained from the combination of two definitions: harmonically m-concave functions and set-valued functions. In this work some properties and characteristics are developed, as well as a Kuhn type theorem and Bernstein-Doetcsh type result for such functions.</description>

      <title>Affine Gateaux Differentials and the von Mises Statistical Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a general study of one-dimensional differentiability for functionals on convex domains that are not necessarily open. The local approximation is carried out by affine functionals, rather than linear ones as in standard Gateaux differentiability. This affine notion of differentiability naturally arises in many applications and, here and there, it appeared in the literature. Our systematic analysis aims to give a general perspective on it.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of homomorphisms among unital completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if it is completely entropy-nonincreasing, where the relevant notion of entropy is a variant of von Neumann entropy. As an intermediate step, we prove that a unital completely positive map between finite-dimensional C*-algebras is a homomorphism if and only if its adjusted Choi operator is a projection. Both equivalences generalize familiar facts about stochastic maps between finite sets.</description>

      <title>Non-linear characterization of Jordan $*$-isomorphisms via maps on positive cones of $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study maps between positive definite or positive semidefinite cones of unital $C^*$-algebras. We describe surjective maps that preserve
  (1) the norm of the quotient or multiplication of elements;
  (2) the spectrum of the quotient or multiplication of elements;
  (3) the spectral seminorm of the quotient or multiplication of elements. These maps relate to the Jordan $*$-isomorphisms between the specified $C^*$-algebras. While a surjection between positive definite cones that preserves the norm of the quotient of elements may not be extended to a linear map between the underlying $C^*$-algebras, the other types of surjections can be extended to a Jordan $*$-isomorphism or a Jordan $*$-isomorphism followed by the implementation by a positive invertible element. We also study conditions for the centrality of positive invertible elements. We generalize "the corollary" regarding surjections between positive semidefinite cones of unital $C^*$-algebras. Applying it, we provide positive solutions to the problem posed by Moln\'ar for general unital $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>The Nikodym property and filters on $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a free filter $F$ on $\omega$, let $N_F=\omega\cup\{p_F\}$, where $p_F\not\in\omega$, be equipped with the following topology: every element of $\omega$ is isolated whereas all open neighborhoods of $p_F$ are of the form $A\cup\{p_F\}$ for $A\in F$. The aim of this paper is to study spaces of the form $N_F$ in the context of the Nikodym property of Boolean algebras. By $\mathcal{AN}$ we denote the class of all those ideals $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ such that for the dual filter $\mathcal{I}^*$ the space $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ carries a sequence $\langle\mu_n\colon n\in\omega\rangle$ of finitely supported signed measures such that $\|\mu_n\|\rightarrow\infty$ and $\mu_n(A)\rightarrow 0$ for every clopen subset $A\subseteq N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$. We prove that $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if there exists a density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $\mathcal{I}$ is contained in the exhaustive ideal $\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$. Consequently, we get that if $\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$ for some density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Stone space $St(\mathcal{A})$ of a given Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ does not have the Nikodym property.
  We observe that each $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ is Kat\v{e}tov below the asymptotic density zero ideal $\mathcal{Z}$, and prove that the class $\mathcal{AN}$ has a subset of size $\mathfrak{d}$ which is dominating with respect to the Kat\v{e}tov order $\leq_K$, but $\mathcal{AN}$ has no $\leq_K$-maximal element. We show that for a density ideal $\mathcal{I}$ it holds $\mathcal{I}\not\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is totally bounded if and only if the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathcal{I}$ contains a countable splitting family.</description>

Abstract: We characterize the family of continuous functions $f\in C([0,1])$ such that the iterates $\widehat{T}^{k}_{i} f$ converge uniformly on $[0,1]$, where $\widehat{T}_i$ is a generalized Kantorovich operator.

      <description>arXiv:2403.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up a new framework to study critical points of functionals defined as combinations of eigenvalues of operators with respect to a given set of parameters: Riemannian metrics, potentials, etc. Our setting builds upon Clarke's differentiation theory to provide a novel understanding of critical metrics. In particular, we unify and refine previous research carried out on Laplace and Steklov eigenvalues. We also use our theory to tackle original examples such as the conformal GJMS operators, the conformal Laplacian, and the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.07399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few decades, the concept of Birkhoff-James orthogonality has been used in several applications. In this survey article, the results known on the necessary and sufficient conditions for Birkhoff-James orthogonality in certain Banach spaces are mentioned. Their applications in studying the geometry of normed spaces are given. The connections between this concept of orthogonality, and the Gateaux derivative and the subdifferential set of the norm function are provided. Several interesting distance formulas can be obtained using the characterizations of Birkhoff-James orthogonality, which are also mentioned. In the end, some new results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Order continuity and regularity on vector lattices and on lattices of continuous functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.08776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give several characterizations of order continuous vector lattice homomorphisms between Archimedean vector lattices. We reduce the proofs of some of the equivalences to the case of composition operators between vector lattices of continuous functions, and so we obtain a characterization of order continuity of such operators. Motivated by this, we investigate various properties of the sublattices of the space $C\left(X\right)$, where $X$ is a Tychonoff topological space. We also obtain several characterizations of a regular sublattice of a vector lattice, and show that the closure of a regular sublattice of a Banach lattice is also regular.</description>

      <title>Locally solid convergences and order continuity of positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02536v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider vector lattices endowed with locally solid convergence structures, which are not necessarily topological. We show that such a convergence is defined by the convergence to $0$ on the positive cone. Some results on unbounded modification which were only available in partial cases are generalized. Order convergence is characterized as the strongest locally solid convergence in which monotone nets converge to their extremums (if they exist). We partially characterize sublattices on which the order convergence is the restriction of the order convergence of the ambient lattice. We show that homomorphism is order continuous iff it is uo-continuous. Uo convergence is characterized independently of order convergence. We show that on the space of continuous function uo convergence is weaker than the compact open convergence iff the underlying topological space contains a dense locally compact subspace. For a large class of convergences we prove that a positive operator is order continuous if and only if its restriction to a dense regular sublattice is order continuous, and that the closure of a regular sublattice is regular with the original sublattice being order dense in the closure. We also present an example of a regular sublattice of a locally solid topological vector lattice whose closure is not regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates uniformly closed subspaces, sublattices, and ideals of finite codimension in Archimedean vector lattices. It is shown that every uniformly closed subspace (or sublattice) of finite codimension may be written as an intersection of uniformly closed subspaces (respectively, sublattices) of codimension one. Every uniformly closed sublattice of codimension $n$ contains a uniformly closed ideal of codimension at most $2n$. If the vector lattice is uniformly complete then every ideal of finite codimension is uniformly closed. Results of the paper extend (and are motivated by) results of [AL90a,AL90b] and , as well as Kakutani's characterization of closed sublattices of $C(K)$ spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ be a set of equi-contractive similitudes on $\mathbb{R}^1$ satisfying the finite-type condition. We study the asymptotic quantization error for self-similar measures $\mu$ associated with $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^N$ and a positive probability vector. With a verifiable assumption, we prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity. This can be regarded as an extension of Graf and Luschgy's result on self-similar measures with the open set condition. Our result is applicable to a significant class of self-similar measures with overlaps, including Erd\"{o}s measure, the $3$-fold convolution of the classical Cantor measure and the self-similar measures on some $\lambda$-Cantor sets.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian product inequality conjecture for disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends various results related to the Gaussian product inequality (GPI) conjecture to the setting of disjoint principal minors of Wishart random matrices. This includes product-type inequalities for matrix-variate analogs of completely monotone functions and Bernstein functions of Wishart disjoint principal minors, respectively. In particular, the product-type inequalities apply to inverse determinant powers. Quantitative versions of the inequalities are also obtained when there is a mix of positive and negative exponents. Furthermore, an extended form of the GPI is shown to hold for the eigenvalues of Wishart random matrices by virtue of their law being multivariate totally positive of order~2 ($\mathrm{MTP}_2$). A new, unexplored avenue of research is presented to study the GPI from the point of view of elliptical distributions.</description>
