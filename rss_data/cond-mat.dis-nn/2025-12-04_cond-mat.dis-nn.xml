      <title>Symmetry-Protected Bipolar Skin Effect and its Topological Breakdown in Disordered Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermitian topology and disorder remains a central puzzle in open quantum systems. While the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is known to be robust against weak perturbations, its fate under strong disorder, particularly in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is not fully understood. Here, we uncover a Z_2 topological bipolar skin effect in a non-Hermitian Rashba chain, where spin-up and spin-down eigenstates localize at opposite boundaries. By strictly computing the Lyapunov exponents and introducing a biorthogonal spin-separation index, we map the global phase diagram and reveal a hierarchical breakdown of topology. We demonstrate that the Z_2 skin effect is protected against moderate disorder but collapses into a trivial skin phase before the ultimate onset of Anderson localization. Our results establish a distinct regime of disorder-robust topological non-reciprocity, distinguishable from both the trivial bulk limit and the Anderson localized phase.</description>

      <title>Stretched Exponential Scaling of Parity-Restricted Energy Gaps in a Random Transverse-Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of a quantum annealing algorithm requires a polynomial scaling of the energy gap. Recently it was shown that a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor $\pm J$ random coupling has a polynomial energy gap in the symmetric subspace of the parity operator [Nature 631, 749-754 (2024)], indicating the efficient preparation of its ground states by quantum annealing. However, it is not clear if this result can be generalized to other spin glass models with continuous or biased randomness. Here we prove that under general independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) of the exchange energies, the energy gap of a one-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model follows a stretched exponential scaling even in the parity-restricted subspace. We discuss the implication of this result to quantum annealing problems.</description>

      <title>Remembrance of Tasks Past in Tunable Physical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential learning in physical networks is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, where training a new task erases solutions to earlier ones. We show that we can significantly enhance memory of previous tasks by introducing a hard threshold in the learning rule, allowing only edges with sufficiently large training signals to be altered. Thresholding confines tuning to the spatial vicinity of inputs and outputs for each task, effectively partitioning the network into weakly overlapping functional regions. Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost. Our results hint at constrained training as a simple, local, and scalable mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in tunable matter.</description>

      <title>A microscopic theory of Anderson localization of electrons in random lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of Anderson localization, characterized by vanishing diffusion due to strong randomness, has been demonstrated in numerous ways. A systematic approach based on the Anderson quantum model of the Fermi gas in random lattices that can describe both diffusive and localized regimes has not yet been fully established. We build upon a recent publication \cite{Janis:2025ab} and present a microscopic theory of disordered electrons covering both the metallic phase with extended Bloch waves and the localized phase where the propagating particle forms a quantum bound state with the hole left behind at the origin. The general theory provides a framework for constructing controlled approximations to one-particle and two-particle Green functions that satisfy the necessary conservation laws and causality requirements in the whole range of disorder strength. It is used explicitly to derive a local, mean-field-like approximation for the two-particle irreducible vertices, enabling quantitative analysis of the solution's properties in both metallic and localized phases, including critical behavior at the Anderson localization transition.</description>

      <title>Testing the Localization Landscape Theory on the Bethe Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Localization Landscape Theory (LLT) provides a classical picture of Anderson localization by introducing an effective confining potential whose percolation is proposed to coincide with the mobility edge. Although this proposal shows remarkable numerical agreement in three dimensions, its fundamental validity remains unsettled. Here we test the LLT analytically on the Bethe lattice, where both the Anderson localization transition and the LLT percolation problem are exactly solvable. We find that the two transitions do not coincide, and their critical behaviors differ markedly. In particular, LLT percolation displays standard mean-field percolation criticality that is fundamentally distinct from the peculiar critical behavior of the Anderson transition on the Bethe lattice. Our results provide an exact benchmark showing that, while geometrically intuitive, the LLT does not capture the true quantum critical properties of localization.</description>

      <title>A high-order regularized delta-Chebyshev method for computing spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for computing spectral densities, and apply it to the evaluation of the local density of states (LDOS) of sparse Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The approach, which we call the high-order delta-Chebyshev method, can be viewed as a variant of the popular regularized Chebyshev kernel polynomial method (KPM), but it uses a high-order accurate approximation of the $\delta$-function to achieve rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit for smooth spectral densities. The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.</description>

      <title>Classical Thermometry of Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers are emerging as programmable, dynamical experimental platforms for probing strongly correlated spin systems. Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking of Current Response in Disordered Exclusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bias-reversal symmetry -- where reversing an external bias inverts the current without changing its magnitude -- is a hallmark of nonequilibrium transport. While this property holds in homogeneous systems such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process, how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect this symmetry has remained unclear. Here, we establish a general criterion showing that the bias-reversal symmetry holds if and only if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal that bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, whereas site disorder breaks it through an interplay between heterogeneity and particle interactions. Our results demonstrate how environmental disorder and interparticle interactions cooperate to generate asymmetric transport, thereby providing a unified theoretical framework relevant to transport through biological and artificial nanochannels.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of the many-body localization transition and the fulfillment of the Harris criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat the disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the standard model of many-body localization (MBL). Two new and independent order parameters stemming solely from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are introduced to probe the eigenstate phase transition in this model. From the symmetry-endowed entropy decomposition, they are the probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the maximally dimensional symmetry subdivision. The finite-size scaling reveals that $\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For the noninteracting case, these transitions coincide, but in the interacting circumstance they separate. Such separability creates an intermediate phase regime and discriminates between the Anderson and MBL transitions. One obstacle whose solution eludes the community to date concerns the violation of the Harris criterion in most numerical investigations of MBL. Upon elucidating the mutually independent measures comprising $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it becomes clear that the previous studies may lack the resolution to pinpoint thus potentially overlook the crucial internal structure of the transition. We show that after this necessary decomposition, the universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion: $\nu\approx2\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work puts forth symmetry combined with entanglement as an organization principle for the generic eigenstate matter and phase transition.</description>

      <title>A typical medium cluster approach for multi-branch phonon localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Anderson localization in various disordered media has sustained significant interest over many decades. Specifically, the Anderson localization of phonons has been viewed as a potential mechanism for creating fascinating thermal transport properties in materials. However, despite extensive work, the influence of the vector nature of phonons on the Anderson localization transition has not been well explored. In order to achieve such an understanding, we extend a recently developed phonon dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its typical medium variant (TMDCA) to investigate spectra and localization of multi-branch phonons in the presence of pure mass disorder. We validate the new formalism against several limiting cases and exact diagonalization results. A comparison of results for the single-branch versus multi-branch case shows that the vector nature of the phonons does not affect the Anderson transition of phonons significantly. The developed multi-branch TMDCA formalism can be employed for studying phonon localization in real materials.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous percolation via suppression of neighboring clusters in a network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states of Path-structured Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.</description>
