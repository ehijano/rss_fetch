      <title>Signatures of magnetic braking in Class 0 protostars ? Exploring the gas kinematics in magnetized models of low-mass star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Only indirect evidence of the role of magnetic braking in regulating gravitational collapse and the formation of circumstellar disks was found from observational work, such as compact disk sizes and the launching of high-velocity collimated protostellar jets. More direct tests of the magnetic braking shaping the angular momentum (AM) of the gas in Class 0 protostars are crucially needed. In the present work we have used non-ideal MHD models of protostellar collapse and synthetic observations of molecular gas spectral emission that we analyze to test whether possible kinematic signatures of the magnetic braking in the gas velocity field can be captured from maps of the molecular gas emission in protostellar envelopes. By comparing the 3D Specific AM of models with varying turbulent energy and magnetization, we show that, in the numerical models of protostellar evolution explored, the increase in magnetization and its consequences on the spatial redistribution of SAM modifies the shapes of the radial profiles of SAM. We show that widely used observational methods fail to quantitatively capture the magnitude of SAM of the gas in protostellar envelopes, and that no method allows to measure the differences in radial evolution of SAM due to different magnetization at all envelope radii. This is especially true in the more magnetized cases. However, our analysis suggests that the detection of symmetric patterns and organized velocity fields, in the moment-1 maps of the molecular line emission as well as monotonous radial profiles of the SAM showing a power-law decline, should be suggestive of a less magnetized scenario. Protostellar cores where efficient magnetic braking is at work are more likely to present a highly asymmetric velocity field, and more prone to show complex radial profiles of their specific angular momentum measured in the equatorial plane.</description>

      <title>Study of 26 Galactic open clusters with extended main-sequence turnoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that some Galactic open clusters (OCs) exhibit extended main-sequence turnoff (eMSTO) in their colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). However, the number of Galactic OCs with eMSTO structures detected so far is limited, and the reasons for their formation are still unclear. This work identifies 26 Galactic OCs with undiscovered eMSTOs and investigates the causes of these features. Stellar population types and fundamental parameters of cluster samples are acquired using CMD fitting methods. Among them, the results of 11 OCs are reliable as the observed CMDs are well-reproduced. We propose the crucial role of stellar binarity and confirm the importance of stellar rotation in reproducing eMSTO morphologies. The results also show that the impact of age spread is important, as it can adequately explain the structure of young OCs and fit the observed CMDs of intermediate-age OCs better.</description>

      <title>Infrared properties of carbon stars in our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the characteristics of carbon stars within our Galaxy through a comprehensive analysis of observational data spanning visual and infrared (IR) bands. Leveraging datasets from IRAS, ISO, Akari, MSX, 2MASS, WISE, Gaia DR3, AAVSO, and the SIMBAD object database, we conduct a detailed comparison between the observational data and theoretical models. To facilitate this comparison, we introduce various IR two-color diagrams (2CDs), IR color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find that the CMDs, which utilize the latest distance and extinction data from Gaia DR3 for a substantial number of carbon stars, are very useful to distinguish carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars from extrinsic carbon stars that are not in the AGB phase. To enhance the accuracy of our analysis, we employ theoretical radiative transfer models for dust shells around CAGB stars. These theoretical dust shell models demonstrate a commendable ability to approximate the observations of CAGB stars across various SEDs, 2CDs, and CMDs. We present the infrared properties of known pulsating variables and explore the infrared variability of the sample stars by analyzing WISE photometric data spanning the last 14 yr. Additionally, we present a novel catalog of CAGB stars, offering enhanced reliability and a wealth of additional information.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar Active Regions Using SDO/HMI Data and an Attention-Aided Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image super-resolution has been an important subject in image processing and recognition. Here, we present an attention-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) for solar image super-resolution. Our method, named SolarCNN, aims to enhance the quality of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ground-truth labels used for training SolarCNN are the LOS magnetograms collected by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Solar ARs consist of strong magnetic fields in which magnetic energy can suddenly be released to produce extreme space weather events, such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and solar energetic particles. SOHO/MDI covers Solar Cycle 23, which is stronger with more eruptive events than Cycle 24. Enhanced SOHO/MDI magnetograms allow for better understanding and forecasting of violent events of space weather. Experimental results show that SolarCNN improves the quality of SOHO/MDI magnetograms in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).</description>

      <title>Cepheids with giant companions: A new, abundant source of Cepheid astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a progress report of our project aiming to increase the number of known Cepheids in double-lined binary (SB2) systems from six to 100 or more. This will allow us, among other goals, to accurately measure masses for a large sample of Cepheids. Currently, only six accurate Cepheid masses are available, which hinders our understanding of their physical properties and renders the Cepheid mass--luminosity relation poorly constrained. At the same time, Cepheids are widely used for essential measurements (e.g., extragalactic distances, the Hubble constant). To examine Cepheid period--luminosity relations, we selected as binary candidates Cepheids that are too bright for their periods. To date, we have confirmed 56 SB2 systems, including the detection of significant orbital motions of the components for 32. We identified systems with orbital periods up to five times shorter than the shortest reported period to date, as well as systems with mass ratios significantly different from unity (suggesting past merger events). Both features are essential to understand how multiplicity affects the formation and destruction of Cepheid progenitors and what effect this has on global Cepheid properties. We also present eight new systems composed of two Cepheids (only one such system was known before). Among confirmed SB2 Cepheids, there are also several wide-orbit systems. In the future, these may facilitate independent accurate geometric distance measurements to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Fuzzy-based Approach for Real-Time Detection of Solar Coronal Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and analysis of the solar coronal holes (CHs) is an important field of study in the domain of solar physics. Mainly, it is required for the proper prediction of the geomagnetic storms which directly or indirectly affect various space and ground-based systems. For the detection of CHs till date, the solar scientist depends on manual hand-drawn approaches. However, with the advancement of image processing technologies, some automated image segmentation methods have been used for the detection of CHs. In-spite of this, fast and accurate detection of CHs are till a major issues. Here in this work, a novel quantum computing-based fast fuzzy c-mean technique has been developed for fast detection of the CHs region. The task has been carried out in two stages, in first stage the solar image has been segmented using a quantum computing based fast fuzzy c-mean (QCFFCM) and in the later stage the CHs has been extracted out from the segmented image based on image morphological operation. In the work, quantum computing has been used to optimize the cost function of the fast fuzzy c-mean (FFCM) algorithm, where quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has been used to optimize the quadratic part of the cost function. The proposed method has been tested for 193 \AA{} SDO/AIA full-disk solar image datasets and has been compared with the existing techniques. The outcome shows the comparable performance of the proposed method with the existing one within a very lesser time.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity evolution during active region emergence and subsequent flare productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Solar active regions (ARs), which are formed by flux emergence, serve as the primary sources of solar eruptions. However, the specific physical mechanism that governs the emergence process and its relationship with flare productivity remains to be thoroughly understood. Methods. We examined 136 emerging ARs, focusing on the evolution of their magnetic helicity and magnetic energy during the emergence phase. Based on the relation between helicity accumulation and magnetic flux evolution, we categorized the samples and investigated their flare productivity. Results. The emerging ARs we studied can be categorized into three types, Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III, and they account for 52.2%, 25%, and 22.8% of the total number in our sample, respectively. Type-I ARs exhibit a synchronous increase in both the magnetic flux and magnetic helicity, while the magnetic helicity in Type-II ARs displays a lag in increasing behind the magnetic flux. Type-III ARs show obvious helicity injections of opposite signs. Significantly, 90% of the flare-productive ARs (flare index &gt; 6) were identified as Type-I ARs, suggesting that this type of AR has a higher potential to become flare productive. In contrast, Type-II and Type-III ARs exhibited a low and moderate likelihood of becoming active, respectively. Our statistical analysis also revealed that Type-I ARs accumulate more magnetic helicity and energy, far beyond what is found in Type-II and Type-III ARs. Moreover, we observed that flare-productive ARs consistently accumulate a significant amount of helicity and energy during their emergence phase. Conclusions. These findings provide valuable insight into the flux emergence phenomena, offering promising possibilities for early-stage predictions of solar eruptions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic diffusion in the Chromosphere on the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects in the chromosphere on the solar wind by performing MHD simulations for Alfv\'en-wave driven winds with explicitly including Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion. We find that MHD waves are significantly damped in the chromosphere by ambipolar diffusion so that the Alfv\'enic Poynting flux that reaches the corona is substantially reduced. As a result, the coronal temperature and the mass loss rate of the solar wind are considerably reduced, compared with those obtained from an ideal MHD case, which is indicative of a great importance of the non-ideal MHD effects in the solar atmosphere. However, the temperature and the mass loss rate are recovered by a small increase in the convection-originated velocity perturbation at the photosphere because of the sensitive dependence of the ambipolar diffusion and reflection of Alfv\'en waves on the physical properties of the chromosphere. We also find that density perturbations in the corona are reduced by the ambipolar diffusion of Alfv\'en waves in the chromosphere because the nonlinear generation of compressible perturbations is suppressed.</description>

      <title>Onset of penumbra formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Fully fledged penumbrae have been widely studied both observationally and theoretically. Yet the relatively fast process of penumbra formation has not been studied closely with high spatial resolution. Aims. We investigate the stages previous to and during the formation of penumbral filaments in a developing sunspot. Methods. We analysed Milne-Eddington inversions from spectro-polarimetric data of the leading sunspot of NOAA 11024 during the development of its penumbra. We focused on selected areas of this protospot in which segments of penumbra develop. Results. We find that few types of distinctive flow patterns develop at the protospot limb and centre sides previous to penumbra formation. The flow in the centre side is often characterised by a persistent (&gt;20 min) inflow-outflow pattern extending radially over 4 arcsec at the direct periphery of the protospot umbra. This inflow-outflow system often correlates with elongated granules, as seen in continuum intensity maps, and is also coupled with magnetic bipolar patches at its edges, as seen in magnetograms. The field is close to horizontal between the bipolar patches, which is indicative of its possible loop configuration. All of these aspects are analogous to observations of magnetic flux emergence. In the protospot limb side, however, we observed a mostly regular pattern associated with small granules located near the protospot intensity boundary. Locally, an inflow develops adjacent to an existing penumbral segment, and this inflow is correlated with a single bright penumbral filament that is brighter than filaments containing the Evershed flow. All investigated areas at the centre and limb side eventually develop penumbral filaments with an actual Evershed flow that starts at the umbral boundary and grows outwards radially as the penumbral filaments become longer in time</description>

      <title>Gnevyshev gap in the large-scale magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of the Gnevyshev gap was first identified in the solar-corona irradiance data (green line). Later, it was studied in the sunspot, coronal, and heliospheric data. We have investigated the Gnevyshev gap in the magnetic field data and have arrived at the conclusion that it reflects the behavior of the large-scale magnetic field. The Gnevyshev gap occurs at the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field at the photosphere level. The presence of the Gnevyshev gap in sunspot data at the photosphere level is disguised by non-global structures that retain dependence on both latitude and longitude (the accepted mathematical term is tessaral, see below for more details). However, it is clearly visible in the magnetic field data at the photosphere level and is even more pronounced at the source surface (i.e., in the corona).</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>

      <title>FAUST XIII. Dusty cavity and molecular shock driven by IRS7B in the Corona Australis cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the chemical diversity observed around low-mass protostars probably resides in the earliest history of these systems. We aim to investigate the impact of protostellar feedback on the chemistry and grain growth in the circumstellar medium of multiple stellar systems. In the context of the ALMA Large Program FAUST, we present high-resolution (50 au) observations of CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO, and SiO and continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm towards the Corona Australis star cluster. Methanol emission reveals an arc-like structure at $\sim$1800 au from the protostellar system IRS7B along the direction perpendicular to the major axis of the disc. The arc is located at the edge of two elongated continuum structures that define a cone emerging from IRS7B. The region inside the cone is probed by H$_2$CO, while the eastern wall of the arc shows bright emission in SiO, a typical shock tracer. Taking into account the association with a previously detected radio jet imaged with JVLA at 6 cm, the molecular arc reveals for the first time a bow shock driven by IRS7B and a two-sided dust cavity opened by the mass-loss process. For each cavity wall, we derive an average H$_2$ column density of $\sim$7$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, a mass of $\sim$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$, and a lower limit on the dust spectral index of $1.4$. These observations provide the first evidence of a shock and a conical dust cavity opened by the jet driven by IRS7B, with important implications for the chemical enrichment and grain growth in the envelope of Solar System analogues.</description>

      <title>3D Gap Opening in Non-Ideal MHD Protoplanetary Disks: Asymmetric Accretion, Meridional Vortices, and Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-angular resolution ALMA observations have revealed rich information about protoplanetary disks, including ubiquitous substructures and three-dimensional gas kinematics at different emission layers. One interpretation of these observations is embedded planets. Previous 3-D planet-disk interaction studies are either based on viscous simulations, or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations with simple prescribed magnetic diffusivities. This study investigates the dynamics of gap formation in 3-D non-ideal MHD disks using non-ideal MHD coefficients from the look-up table that is self-consistently calculated based on the thermo-chemical code. We find a concentration of the poloidal magnetic flux in the planet-opened gap (in agreement with previous work) and enhanced field-matter coupling due to gas depletion, which together enable efficient magnetic braking of the gap material, driving a fast accretion layer significantly displaced from the disk midplane. The fast accretion helps deplete the gap further and is expected to negatively impact the growth of planetary embryos. It also affects the corotation torque by shrinking the region of horseshoe orbits on the trailing side of the planet. Together with the magnetically driven disk wind, the fast accretion layer generates a large, persistent meridional vortex in the gap, which breaks the mirror symmetry of gas kinematics between the top and bottom disk surfaces. Finally, by studying the kinematics at the emission surfaces, we discuss the implications of planets in realistic non-ideal MHD disks on kinematics observations.</description>

      <title>Stellar wind bubbles of OB stars as Galactic cosmic-ray re-accelerators</title>

Abstract: Cosmic rays are highly energetic messengers propagating in magnetized plasma, which are, possibly but not exclusively, accelerated at astrophysical shocks. Amongst the variety of astrophysical objects presenting shocks, the huge circumstellar stellar wind bubbles forming around very massive stars, are potential non thermal emitters. We present the 1D magnetohydrodynamical simulation of the evolving magnetized surroundings of a single, OB type main sequence 60 Mo star, which is post processed to calculate the re-acceleration of preexisting non-thermal particles of the Galactic cosmic ray background. It is found that the forward shock of such circumstellar bubble can, during the early phase (1 Myr) of its expansion, act as a substantial reaccelerator of pre existing interstellar cosmic rays. This results in an increasing excess emission flux by a factor of 5, the hadronic component producing gamma-rays by pion0 decay being more important than those by synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation mechanisms. We propose that this effect is at work in the circumstellar environments of massive stars in general and we conjecture that other nebulae such as the stellar wind bow shocks of runaway massive stars also act as Galactic cosmic-ray re-accelerators. Particularly, this study supports the interpretation of the enhanced hadronic emission flux measured from the surroundings of kappa Ori as originating from the acceleration of pre-existing particles at the forward shock of its wind bubble.</description>

Abstract: Heliophysics is the system science of the physical connections between the Sun and the solar system. As the physics of the local cosmos, it embraces space weather and planetary habitability. The wider view of comparative heliophysics forms a template for conditions in exoplanetary systems and provides a view over time of the aging Sun and its magnetic activity, of the heliosphere in different settings of the interstellar medium and subject to stellar impacts, of the space physics over evolving planetary dynamos, and of the long-term influence on planetary atmospheres by stellar radiation and wind.
  Based on a series of NASA-funded summer schools for early-career researchers, this textbook is intended for students in physical sciences in later years of their university training and for beginning graduate students in fields of solar, stellar, (exo-)planetary, and planetary-system sciences. The book emphasizes universal processes from a perspective that draws attention to what provides Earth (and similar (exo-)planets) with a relatively stable setting in which life as we know it could thrive. The text includes 200 "Activities" in the form of exercises, explorations, literature readings, "what if" challenges, and group discussion topics; many of the Activities provide additional information complementing the main text. Solutions and discussions are included in an Appendix for a selection of the exercises.</description>

      <title>A Method for Determining the Locations and Configurations of Magnetic Reconnection within 3D Turbulent Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Three-dimensional (3D) reconnection is an important mechanism for efficiently releasing energy during astrophysical eruptive events, which is difficult to be quantitatively analyzed especially within turbulent plasmas.
  Aims. In this paper, an efficient method for identifying locations and configurations of 3D reconnection from MHD data is developed.
  Methods. This method analyzes the local nonideal electric field and magnetic structure at an arbitrary position. As only performing algebraical manipulations on the discrete field data and avoiding computationally expensive operations like field-line tracing and root-finding, this method naturally possesses high efficiency. To validate this method, we apply it to the 3D data from a high-resolution simulation of a Harris-sheet reconnection and a data-driven simulation of a coronal flux rope eruption.
  Results. It is shown that this method can precisely identify the local structures of discrete magnetic field. Through the information of nonideal electric field and the geometric attributes of magnetic field, the local structures of reconnection sites can be effectively and comprehensively determined. For fine turbulent processes, both qualitative pictures and quantitative statistical properties of small-scale reconnection structures can be obtained. For large-scale solar simulations, macro-scale magnetic structures such as flux ropes and eruption current sheets can also be recognized.
  Conclusions. We develop a powerful method to analyze multi-scale structures of 3D reconnection. It can be applied not only in MHD simulations but also in kinetic simulations, plasma experiments, and in-situ observations.</description>

      <title>A simple method to measure numax for asteroseismology: application to 16,000 oscillating Kepler red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of numax (the frequency of maximum oscillation power) for asteroseismology has been demonstrated widely in the previous decade, especially for red giants. With the large amount of photometric data from CoRoT, Kepler and TESS, several automated algorithms to retrieve numax values have been introduced. Most of these algorithms correct the granulation background in the power spectrum by fitting a model and subtracting it before measuring numax. We have developed a method that does not require fitting to the granulation background. Instead, we simply divide the power spectrum by a function of the form nu^-2, to remove the slope due to granulation background, and then smooth to measure numax. This method is fast, simple and avoids degeneracies associated with fitting. The method is able to measure oscillations in 99.9% of previously-studied Kepler red giants, with a systematic offset of 1.5 % in numax values that that we are able to calibrate. On comparing the seismic radii from this work with Gaia, we see similar trends to those observed in previous studies. Additionally, our values of width of the power envelope can clearly identify the dipole mode suppressed stars as a distinct population, hence as a way to detect them. We also applied our method to stars with low (0.19--18.35 muHz) and found it works well to correctly identify the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet and Chromospheric activity and Habitability of M stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M-type stars are crucial for stellar activity studies since they cover two types of magnetic dynamos and particularly intriguing for habitability studies due to their abundance and long lifespans during the main-sequence stage. In this paper, we used the LAMOST DR9 catalog and the GALEX UV archive data to investigate the chromospheric and UV activities of M-type stars. All the chromospheric and UV activity indices clearly show the saturated and unsaturated regimes and the well-known activity-rotation relation, consistent with previous studies. Both the FUV and NUV activity indices exhibit a single-peaked distribution, while the {\rm H$\alpha$} and \rm {Ca \scriptsize{\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}} \normalsize H$\&amp;$K} indices show a distinct double-peaked distribution. The gap between these peaks suggests a rapid transition from a saturated population to an unsaturated one. The smoothly varying distributions of different subtypes suggest a rotation-dependent dynamo for both early-type (partly convective) to late-type (fully convective) M stars. We identified a group of stars with high UV activity above the saturation regime (log$R^{\prime}_{\rm NUV} &gt; -2.5$) but low chromospheric activity, and the underlying reason is unknown. By calculating the continuously habitable zone and the UV habitable zone for each star, we found about 70\% stars in the total sample and 40\% stars within 100 pc are located in the overlapping region of these two habitable zones, indicating a number of M stars are potentially habitable. Finally, we examined the possibility of UV activity studies of M stars using the China Space Station Telescope.</description>

      <title>Non-evolutionary effects on period change in Magellanic Cepheids I. New binary systems revealed from Light Travel Time Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Period change studies give a window to probe into the evolution and dynamics of Cepheids. While evolutionary period changes have been well studied both observationally and theoretically, non-evolutionary period changes lack a systematic and quantitative description. The overall objective is to have a quantitative understanding of the full picture of non-evolutionary period changes in Cepheids, to develop a formalism to disentangle it from the secular evolutionary period change. In the first part of the series of works, we aim to conduct a systematic search for non-evolutionary period changes to search for Cepheids in likely binary configuration and quantify their incidence rates in the Magellanic Clouds. We collect more than decade-long time-series photometry from the publically available survey, Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), with more than 7200 Cepheids collectively from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample contains both fundamental-mode and first overtone-mode Cepheids. Then we calculate observed minus calculated ($O-C$) diagrams to reveal the light-travel time effect (LTTE). In our search, out of an overall sample of more than 7200 Cepheids, we found 52 candidate Cepheid binary systems in the LMC (30 fundamental and 22 first overtone-mode) and 145 in the SMC (85 fundamental and 60 first overtone-mode). The majority of the sample is characterized by orbital periods of 2000-4000\,d and eccentricities of 0.2-0.5. Moreover, we report two candidates in each galaxy with the Cepheid likely existing with a giant companion. The incidence rate ratio for SMC to LMC calculated from our sample is in agreement with binary Cepheid population synthesis predictions.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating in 2D Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Quasi-Perpendicular Low-Beta Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the thermal electron energization in 1D and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular, low-beta ($\beta_p=0.25$) collisionless ion-electron shocks with mass ratio $m_i/m_e=200$, fast Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{ms}=1$-$4$, and upstream magnetic field angle $\theta_{Bn} = 55$-$85^\circ$ from shock normal $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$. It is known that shock electron heating is described by an ambipolar, $\boldsymbol{B}$-parallel electric potential jump, $\Delta\phi_\parallel$, that scales roughly linearly with the electron temperature jump. Our simulations have $\Delta\phi_\parallel/(0.5 m_i {u_\mathrm{sh}}^2) \sim 0.1$-$0.2$ in units of the pre-shock ions' bulk kinetic energy, in agreement with prior measurements and simulations. Different ways to measure $\phi_\parallel$, including the use of de Hoffmann-Teller frame fields, agree to tens-of-percent accuracy. Neglecting off-diagonal electron pressure tensor terms can lead to a systematic underestimate of $\phi_\parallel$ in our low-$\beta_p$ shocks. We further focus on two $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ shocks: a $\mathcal{M}_s=4$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=1.8$) case with a long, $30 d_i$ precursor of whistler waves along $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$, and a $\mathcal{M}_s=7$ ($\mathcal{M}_A=3.2$) case with a shorter, $5d_i$ precursor of whistlers oblique to both $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$; $d_i$ is the ion skin depth. Within the precursors, $\phi_\parallel$ has a secular rise towards the shock along multiple whistler wavelengths and also has localized spikes within magnetic troughs. In a 1D simulation of the $\mathcal{M}_s=4$, $\theta_{Bn}=65^\circ$ case, $\phi_\parallel$ shows a weak dependence on the electron plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratio $\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$, and $\phi_\parallel$ decreases by a factor of 2 as $m_i/m_e$ is raised to the true proton-electron value of 1836.</description>

      <title>Resolving the explosion of supernova 2023ixf in Messier 101 within its complex circumstellar environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observing a supernova explosion shortly after it occurs can reveal important information about the physics of stellar explosions and the nature of the progenitor stars of supernovae (SNe). When a star with a well-defined edge explodes in vacuum, the first photons to escape from its surface appear as a brief shock-breakout flare. The duration of this flare can extend to at most a few hours even for nonspherical breakouts from supergiant stars, after which the explosion ejecta should expand and cool. Alternatively, for stars exploding within a distribution of sufficiently dense optically thick circumstellar material, the first photons escape from the material beyond the stellar edge, and the duration of the initial flare can extend to several days, during which the escaping emission indicates photospheric heating. The difficulty in detecting SN explosions promptly after the event has so far limited data regarding supergiant stellar explosions mostly to serendipitous observations that, owing to the lack of ultraviolet (UV) data, were unable to determine whether the early emission is heating or cooling, and hence the nature of the early explosion event. Here, we report observations of SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy M101, covering the early days of the event. Using UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as well as a comprehensive set of additional multiwavelength observations, we trace the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the event and are able to temporally resolve the emergence and evolution of the SN emission.</description>

      <title>BSEC method for unveiling open clusters and its application to Gaia DR3: 83 new clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) are common in the Milky Way, but most of them remain undiscovered. There are numerous techniques (e.g., machine-learning algorithms) available for the exploration of OCs. However, each method has its limitations and therefore, different approaches to discovering OCs hold significant value. We develop a comprehensive approach method to automatically explore the data space and identify potential OC candidates with relatively reliable membership determination. This approach combines the techniques of HDBSCAN, GMM, and a novel cluster member identification technique, color excess constraint. The new method exhibits efficiency in detecting OCs while ensuring precise determination of cluster memberships. It is called Blind Search-Extra Constraint (BSEC) method. It is successfully applied to the Gaia DR3, and 83 new OCs are found. This study also reports 621 new OC candidates with discernible main sequence or red giant branch. The BSEC technique can discard some false negatives of previous works, which takes about 3 percentage of known clusters. As an extra constraint, color excess (or 2-color) constraint is useful for removing fake cluster member stars from the clusters that are identified from the positions and proper motions of stars, and getting more precise CMDs, when differential reddening of member stars of a cluster is not large (e.g., \DeltaE(G_BP -G_RP)&lt;0.5 mag). It makes the CMDs of 15 percent clusters clearer (in particular for the region near turnoff) and therefore is helpful for CMD and stellar population studies. Our result suggests that color excess constraint is more appropriate for clusters with small differential reddening, such as globular clusters or older OCs, and clusters that the distances of member stars cannot be determined accurately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters (NSCs), made up of a dense concentrations of stars and the compact objects they leave behind, are ubiquitous in the central regions of galaxies, surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Close interactions between stars and stellar-mass black holes (sBH) lead to tidal disruption events (TDEs). We uncover an interesting new phenomenon: For a subset of these, the unbound debris (to the sBH) remain bound to the SMBH, accreting at a later time, and thus giving rise to a second flare. We compute the rate of such events, and find them ranging within $10^{-6}$ -$10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$gal$^{-1}$ for SMBH mass $\simeq 10^{6}-10^{9}M_\odot$. Time delays between the two flares spread over a wide range, from less than a year to hundreds of years. The temporal evolution of the light curves of the second flare can vary between the standard $t^{-5/3}$ power-law to much steeper decays, providing a natural explanation for observed light curves in tension with the classical TDE model. Our predictions have implications for learning about NSC properties and calibrating its sBH population. Some double flares may be electromagnetic counterparts to LISA Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral (EMRI) sources. Another important implication is the possible existence of TDE-like events in very massive SMBHs, where TDEs are not expected. Such flares can affect spin measurements relying on TDEs in the upper SMBH range.</description>
