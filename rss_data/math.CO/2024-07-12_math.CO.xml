      <title>Asymptotics for Palette Sparsification from Variable Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the following holds for each $\varepsilon &gt;0$. For $G$ an $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $D$, lists $S_v$ ($v\in V(G)$), and $L_v$ chosen uniformly from the ($(1+\varepsilon)\ln n$)-subsets of $S_v$ (independent of other choices), \[ \mbox{$G$ admits a proper coloring $\sigma$ with $\sigma_v\in L_v$ $\forall v$} \] with probability tending to 1 as $D\to \infty$.
  When each $S_v $ is $\{1\dots D+1\}$, this is an asymptotically optimal version of the ``palette sparsification'' theorem of Assadi, Chen and Khanna that was proved in an earlier paper by the present authors.</description>

      <title>Upho lattices I: examples and non-examples of cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A poset is called upper homogeneous, or "upho," if every principal order filter of the poset is isomorphic to the whole poset. We study (finite type $\mathbb{N}$-graded) upho lattices, with an eye towards their classification. Any upho lattice has associated to it a finite graded lattice called its core, which determines its rank generating function. We investigate which finite graded lattices arise as cores of upho lattices, providing both positive and negative results. On the one hand, we show that many well-studied finite lattices do arise as cores, and we present combinatorial and algebraic constructions of the upho lattices into which they embed. On the other hand, we show there are obstructions which prevent many finite lattices from being cores.</description>

      <title>If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If taken seriously, the advice in the title leads to interesting combinatorics. Consider N people moving between M rooms as follows: at each step, simultaneously, the smartest person in each room moves to a different room of their choice. There are M^N possible configurations. We classify the pairs (N,M) such that every configuration can be reached from every other. More precisely, let G(N,M) be the directed graph with vertices representing configurations and edges representing legal moves. We prove that the graph G(N,M) is strongly connected if and only if M&gt;=N+1 (one extra room for maneuvering is both required and sufficient). In the case M&lt;=N, we explicitly describe the components. Proofs are based on algebraic properties of derangements.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Cliques in Edge-Colored Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V,E)$ be an $n$-vertex graph and let $c: E \to \mathbb{N}$ be a coloring of its edges. Let $d^c(v)$ be the number of distinct colors on the edges at $v \in V$ and let $\delta^c(G) = \min_{v \in V} \{ d^{c}(v) \}$. H. Li proved that $\delta^c(G) &gt; n/2$ guarantees a rainbow triangle in $G$. We give extensions of Li's result to cliques $K_r$ for $r \ge 4$.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic and diameter of planar integral point sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A point set $M$ in Euclidean plane is called an integral point set in semi-general position if all the distances between the elements of $M$ are integers, and $M$ does not contain collinear triples. We improve the lower bound for diameter of such sets in the particular case when the characteristic of the set is of the form $4k+1$ or $4k+2$. To achieve that, we combine hyperbolae-based and grid-based toolsets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the $k$-cut complex $\Delta_k(G)$ of a graph $G$ initiated in the paper of Bayer, Denker, Jeli\'c Milutinovi\'c, Rowlands, Sundaram and Xue [Topology of cut complexes of graphs, SIAM J. on Discrete Math. 38(2): 1630--1675 (2024)].
  We give explicit formulas for the $f$- and $h$-polynomials of the cut complex $\Delta_k(G_1+G_2) $ of the disjoint union of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, and for the homology representation of $\Delta_k(K_m+K_n)$.
  We also study the cut complex of the squared path and the grid graph. Our techniques include tools from combinatorial topology, discrete Morse theory and equivariant poset topology.</description>

      <title>Associated Mersenne graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new sub-family of Hypercubes called the \textit{associated Mersenne graphs} $\mathcal{M}_{n}$ are introduced. The definition of associated Mersenne graphs is motivated from the Fibonacci-run graphs ({\"O}. E\v{g}ecio\v{g}lu, V. Ir\v{s}i\v{c}, 2021) by extending run-constrained strings to circularly-run-constrained strings. The name of this new family of graphs is identified with the interesting fact that $|V(\mathcal{M}_{n})|$ is equal to the $n$-th associated Mersenne number. Various interesting structural and enumerative properties of associated Mersenne graphs are investigated, including the analogue of the fundamental recursion, number of vertices and edges, radius, diameter, center, periphery and medianicity. Some future research directions and open problems concerning associated Mersenne graphs are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Explicit estimates for the Stirling numbers of the second kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit estimates for the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,m)$. With a few exceptions, such estimates are asymptotically sharp. The form of these estimates varies according to $m$ lying in the central or non-central regions of $\{1,\ldots ,n\}$. In each case, we use a different probabilistic representation of $S(n,m)$ in terms of well known random variables to show the corresponding results.</description>

      <title>The first Steklov eigenvalue of planar graphs and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steklov eigenvalue problem was introduced over a century ago, and its discrete form attracted interest recently. Let $D$ and $\delta \Omega$ be the maximum vertex degree and the set of vertices of degree one in a graph $\mathcal{G}$ respectively. Let $\lambda_2$ be the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue of $(\mathcal{G}, \delta \Omega)$. In this paper, using the circle packing theorem and conformal mapping, we first show that $\lambda_2 \leq 8D / |\delta \Omega|$ for planar graphs. This can be seen as a discrete analogue of Kokarev's bound [Variational aspects of Laplace eigenvalues on Riemannian surfaces, Adv. Math. (2014)], that is, $\lambda_2 &lt; 8\pi / |\partial \Omega|$ for compact surfaces with boundary of genus $0$. Let $B$ and $L$ be the maximum block size and the diameter of a block graph $\mathcal{G}$ repsectively. Secondly, we prove that $\lambda_2 \leq B^2 (D-1)/ |\delta \Omega|$ and $\lambda_2 \leq (2L + (L-2)(B-2))/L^2$ for block graphs, which extend the results on trees by He and Hua [Upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues on trees, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations (2022)]. In the end, for trees with fixed leaf number and maximum degree, candidates that achieve the maximum first Steklov eigenvalue are given.</description>

      <title>Partition regularity of generalized Pythagorean pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address partition regularity problems for homogeneous quadratic equations. A consequence of our main results is that, under natural conditions on the coefficients $a,b,c$, for any finite coloring of the positive integers, there exists a solution to $ax^2+by^2=cz^2$ where $x$ and $y$ have the same color (and similar results for $x,z$ and $y,z$). For certain choices of $(a,b,c)$, our result is conditional on an Elliott-type conjecture. Our proofs build on and extend previous arguments of the authors dealing with the Pythagorean equation. We make use of new uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions and concentration estimates for multiplicative functions along arbitrary binary quadratic forms.</description>

      <title>Noncrossing partition posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the poset NC^d_n of all noncrossing partitions such that each block has cardinality 1 modulo d and each block of the dual partition also has cardinality 1 modulo d. We obtain the cardinality, the M\"obius function, the rank numbers, the antipode, and the number of maximal chains. Generalizing work of Stanley, we give an edge labeling such that the labels of the maximal chains are exactly the d-parking functions. We also introduce two classes of labeled trees: the first class is in bijective correspondence with the noncrossing partitions in NC^d_n and the second class is in bijective correspondence with the maximal chains.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier transform plays a central role in many geometric and combinatorial problems cast in vector spaces over finite fields. In general, sets with good uniform bounds for the Fourier transform are less structured, more `random', and can often be analysed more easily. In many cases obtaining good \emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good pointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a more nuanced approach where one seeks to bound the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform instead of only the maximum. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that a rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this new approach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance conjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set.</description>

      <title>A lattice framework for generalizing shellable complexes and matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of power lattices that unifies and extends the equicardinal geometric lattices, Cartesian products of subspace lattices, and multiset subset lattices, among several others. The notions of shellability for simplicial complexes, q-complexes, and multicomplexes are then unified and extended to that of complexes in power lattices, which we name as P-complexes. A nontrivial class of shellable P-complexes are obtained via P-complexes of the independent sets of a matroid in power lattice, which we introduce to generalize matroids in Boolean lattices, q-matroids in subspace lattices, and sum-matroids in Cartesian products of subspace lattices. We also prove that shellable P-complexes in a power lattice yield shellable order complexes, extending the celebrated result of shellability of order complexes of (equicardinal) geometric lattices by Bj\"orner and also, a recent result on shellability of order complexes of lexicographically shellable q-complexes. Finally, we provide a construction of matroids on the lattice of multiset subsets from weighted graphs. We also consider a variation of Stanley-Reisner rings associated with shellable multicomplexes than the one considered by Herzog and Popescu and proved that these rings are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay.</description>

Abstract: We prove PET and quantitative concatenation results for general multidimensional polynomial progressions, with at most polynomial losses in the parameters. In the companion paper \cite{KKL24b}, we use these estimates to obtain an explicit upper bound on the size of a set in $[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y), (x, y + P(z))$, where $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an integer root of multiplicity 1.</description>

      <title>Corners with polynomial side length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $P$-polynomial corner, for $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ a polynomial, is a triple of points $(x,y),\; (x+P(z),y),\; (x,y+P(z))$ for $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$. In the case where $P$ has an integer root of multiplicity $1$, we show that if $A \subseteq [N]^2$ does not contain any nontrivial $P$-polynomial corners, then $$|A| \ll_P \frac{N^2}{(\log\log\log N)^c}$$ for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$. This simultaneously generalizes a result of Shkredov about corner-free sets and a recent result of Peluse, Sah, and Sawhney about sets without $3$-term arithmetic progressions of common difference $z^2-1$. The main ingredients in our proof are a multidimensional quantitative concatenation result from our companion paper \cite{KKL24a} and a novel degree-lowering argument for box norms.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

      <title>Slab tilings, flips and the triple twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A domino is a $2\times 1\times 1$ parallelepiped formed by the union of two unit cubes and a slab is a $2\times 2\times 1$ parallelepiped formed by the union of four unit cubes. We are interested in tiling regions formed by the finite union of unit cubes. We investigate domino tilings, slab tilings and mixed tilings (vertical dominoes and horizontal slabs). A flip is a local move: in a slab (resp. domino) tiling, two neighboring parallel slabs (resp. dominoes) are removed and placed back in a different position.
  We may interpret a three dimensional region as being made of floors. A slab or domino which crosses two floors is vertical, and horizontal otherwise. We can also define a flip in a mixed tiling, we replace four vertical dominoes in a $2\times 2\times 2$ box by two horizontal slabs and vice-versa.
  Inspired by the twist for domino tilings we construct a flip invariant for mixed tilings. Based on this, we then construct the triple twist for slab tilings: an invariant under flips assuming values in $\mathbb{Z}^3$. We show that if the region is a large box then the triple twist assumes a large number of possible values, at least proportional to the fourth power of the volume. We also give examples of smaller regions for which the triple twist assumes only one value and the set of tilings is connected under flips.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>

      <title>SL(2,Z)-matrixizations of generalized Markov numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $k\geq 0$, a $k$-generalized Markov number is an integer which appears in some positive integer solution to the $k$-generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k(yz + zx + xy) = (3 + 3k)xyz$. In this paper, we discuss a combinatorial structure of generalized Markov numbers. To investigate this structure in detail, we use two families of matrices: the $k$-generalized Cohn matrices and the $k$-Markov-monodromy matrices, which are elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ whose $(1,2)$-entries are $k$-generalized Markov numbers. We show that these two families of matrices recover the tree structure of the positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation, and we give geometric interpretations and a combinatorial interpretation of $k$-generalized Markov numbers. As an application, we provide a computation algorithm of classical Markov number from a one-dimensional dynamical viewpoint. Moreover, we clarify a relation between $k$-generalized Markov numbers and toric surface singularities via continued fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear version of Roth's theorem states that dense sets of integers contain configurations of the form $x$, $x+d$, $x+d^2$. We obtain a multidimensional version of this result, which can be regarded as a first step towards effectivising those cases of the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem involving polynomials with distinct degrees. In addition, we prove an effective ``popular'' version of this result, showing that every dense set has some non-zero $d$ such that the number of configurations with difference parameter $d$ is almost optimal. Perhaps surprisingly, the quantitative dependence in this result is exponential, compared to the tower-type bounds encountered in the popular linear Roth theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex reflection groups comprise a generalization of Weyl groups of semisimple Lie algebras, and even more generally of finite Coxeter groups. They have been heavily studied since their introduction and complete classification in the 1950s by Shephard and Todd, due to their many applications to combinatorics, representation theory, knot theory, and mathematical physics, to name a few examples. For each given complex reflection group G, we explain a new recipe for producing an integrable system of linear differential equations whose differential Galois group is precisely G. We exhibit these systems explicitly for many (low-rank) irreducible complex reflection groups in the Shephard-Todd classification.</description>

      <title>Inversion sequences avoiding the pattern 010</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inversion sequences are integer sequences $(\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n)$ such that $0 \leqslant \sigma_i &lt; i$ for all $1 \leqslant i \leqslant n$. The study of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences began in two independent articles by Mansour-Shattuck and Corteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch in 2015 and 2016. These two initial articles solved the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding a single pattern for every pattern of length 3 except the patterns 010 and 100. The case 100 was recently solved by Mansour and Yildirim. We solve the final case by making use of a decomposition of inversion sequences avoiding the pattern 010. Our decomposition needs to take into account the maximal value, and the number of distinct values occurring in the inversion sequence. We then expand our method to solve the enumeration of inversion sequences avoiding the pairs of patterns $\{010, 000\}, \{010, 110\}, \{010, 120\}$, and the Wilf-equivalent pairs $\{010, 201\} \sim \{010, 210\}$. For each family of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences considered, its enumeration requires the enumeration of some family of constrained words avoiding the same patterns, a question which we also solve.</description>

      <title>On harmonious coloring of hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A harmonious coloring of a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is a vertex coloring such that no two vertices in the same edge have the same color, and each $k$-element subset of colors appears on at most one edge. The harmonious number $h(H)$ is the least number of colors needed for such a coloring.
  The paper contains a new proof of the upper bound $h(H)=O(\sqrt[k]{k!m})$ on the harmonious number of hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ with $m$ edges. We use the local cut lemma of A. Bernshteyn.</description>

Abstract: The systematic study of Tur\'an-type extremal problems for edge-ordered graphs was initiated by Gerbner et al. in 2020. Here we characterize connected edge-ordered graphs with linear extremal functions and show that the extremal function of other connected edge-ordered graphs is $\Omega(n\log n)$. This characterization and dichotomy are similar in spirit to results of F\"uredi et al. (2020) about vertex-ordered and convex geometric graphs. We also extend the study of extremal function of short edge-ordered paths by Gerbner et al. to some longer paths.</description>

      <title>Finding cliques and dense subgraphs using edge queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a large clique in an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph where we are allowed unbounded computational time but can only query a limited number of edges. Recall that the largest clique in $G \sim G(n,1/2)$ has size roughly $2\log_{2} n$. Let $\alpha_{\star}(\delta,\ell)$ be the supremum over $\alpha$ such that there exists an algorithm that makes $n^{\delta}$ queries in total to the adjacency matrix of $G$, in a constant $\ell$ number of rounds, and outputs a clique of size $\alpha \log_{2} n$ with high probability. We give improved upper bounds on $\alpha_{\star}(\delta,\ell)$ for every $\delta \in [1,2)$ and $\ell \geq 3$. We also study analogous questions for finding subgraphs with density at least $\eta$ for a given $\eta$, and prove corresponding impossibility results.</description>

      <title>Heights of posets associated with Green's relations on semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a semigroup $S$, for each Green's relation $\mathcal{K}\in\{\mathcal{L},\mathcal{R},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{H}\}$ on $S,$ the $\mathcal{K}$-height of $S,$ denoted by $H_{\mathcal{K}}(S),$ is the height of the poset of $\mathcal{K}$-classes of $S.$ More precisely, if there is a finite bound on the sizes of chains of $\mathcal{K}$-classes of $S,$ then $H_{\mathcal{K}}(S)$ is defined as the maximum size of such a chain; otherwise, we say that $S$ has infinite $\mathcal{K}$-height. We discuss the relationships between these four $\mathcal{K}$-heights. The main results concern the class of stable semigroups, which includes all finite semigroups. In particular, we prove that a stable semigroup has finite $\mathcal{L}$-height if and only if it has finite $\mathcal{R}$-height if and only if it has finite $\mathcal{J}$-height. In fact, for a stable semigroup $S,$ if $H_{\mathcal{L}}(S)=n$ then $H_{\mathcal{R}}(S)\leq2^n-1$ and $H_{\mathcal{J}}(S)\leq2^n-1,$ and we exhibit a family of examples to prove that these bounds are sharp. Furthermore, we prove that if $2\leq H_{\mathcal{L}}(S)&lt;\infty$ and $2\leq H_{\mathcal{R}}(S)&lt;\infty,$ then $H_{\mathcal{J}}(S)\leq H_{\mathcal{L}}(S)+H_{\mathcal{R}}(S)-2.$ We also show that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there exists a semigroup $S$ such that $H_{\mathcal{L}}(S)=H_{\mathcal{R}}(S)=2^n+n-3$ and $H_{\mathcal{J}}(S)=2^{n+1}-4.$ By way of contrast, we prove that for a regular semigroup the $\mathcal{L}$-, $\mathcal{R}$- and $\mathcal{H}$-heights coincide with each other, and are greater or equal to the $\mathcal{J}$-height. Moreover, in a stable, regular semigroup the $\mathcal{L}$-, $\mathcal{R}$-, $\mathcal{H}$- and $\mathcal{J}$-heights are all equal.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Regular Sequences: Summatory Functions and Divide-and-Conquer Recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the asymptotic analysis of regular sequences as defined by Allouche and Shallit, it is usually advisable to study their summatory function because the original sequence has a too fluctuating behaviour. It might be that the process of taking the summatory function has to be repeated if the sequence is fluctuating too much. In this paper we show that for all regular sequences except for some degenerate cases, repeating this process finitely many times leads to a ``nice'' asymptotic expansion containing periodic fluctuations whose Fourier coefficients can be computed using the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences by the first two authors of this paper.
  In a recent paper, Hwang, Janson, and Tsai perform a thorough investigation of divide-and-conquer recurrences. These can be seen as $2$-regular sequences. By considering them as the summatory function of their forward difference, the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences become applicable. We thoroughly investigate the case of a polynomial toll function.</description>

Abstract: A positroid is an ordered matroid realizable by a real matrix with all nonnegative maximal minors. Postnikov gave a map from ordered matroids to Grassmann necklaces, for which there is a unique positroid in each fiber of the map. Here, we give forbidden minor characterizations of ternary and quaternary positroids. We show that a positroid is ternary if and only if it is near-regular, and that all ternary positroids are formed by direct sums and $2$-sums of binary positroids and positroid ordered whirls. We prove that a positroid is quaternary if and only if it is $U^2_6, U^4_6,$ and $P_6$-free. Under the map from ordered matroids to Grassmann necklaces, we fully characterize the fibers of ternary positroids, referred to as their positroid envelope classes; in particular, the envelope class of a positroid ordered whirl of rank-$r$ contains exactly four matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Renyi random graph model $G_{n,p}$ is the model of perturbed graphs introduced by Bohman, Frieze and Martin (Bohman, Frieze, Martin 2003). This is a special case of the model of randomly augmented graphs studied in this paper. An augmented graph denoted by $pert_{H,p}$ is the union of a deterministic host graph and a random graph $G_{n,p}$. Among the first problems in perturbed graphs has been the question how many random edges are needed to ensure Hamiltonicity of the graph. This question was answered in the paper by Bohman, Frieze and Martin. The host graph is often chosen to be a dense graph. In recent years several papers on combinatorial problems in perturbed graphs were published, e.g. on the emergence of powers of Hamiltonian cycles (Dudek, Reiher, Ruci\'nski, Schacht 2020), some positional games played on perturbed graphs (Clemens, Hamann, Mogge, Parczyk, 2020) and the behavior of multiple invariants e.g. fixed clique size (Bohman, Frieze, Krivelevich, Martin, 2004). In this paper we study the chromatic number of randomly augmented graphs. We concentrate on a host graph $H$ with chromatic number $o(n)$, augmented by a $G_{n,p}$ with $n^{-\frac{1}{3} + \delta}\leq p(n) \leq 1-\delta$ for some $\delta \in (0,1)$. Our main result is an upper bound for the chromatic number: we show that asymptotically almost surely $\chi(pert_{H,p}) \leq (1+o(1)) \cdot \frac{n \log(b)}{2 (\log(n) - \log(\chi(H))}$ where $b = (1-p)^{-1}$. This result collapses to the famous theorem of Bollob\'as (1988), when $H$ is the empty host graph, thus our result can be regarded as a generalization of the latter. Our proof is not constructive. Further, we give a constructive coloring algorithm, when the chromatic number of the host graph is at most $\frac{n}{\log(n)^{\alpha}},$ $\alpha&gt;\frac{1}{2}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to representation theory of finite groups that uses some basic algebraic geometry and allows to do all the theory without using characters. With this approach, to any finite group $G$ we associate a finite number of points and show that any field containing the coordinates of those points works fine as the ground field for the representations of $G$. We apply this point of view to the symmetric group $S_d$, finding easy equations for the different symmetries of functions in $d$ variables. As a byproduct, we give an easy proof of a recent result by Tocino that states that the hyperdeterminant of a $d$-dimensional matrix is zero for all but two types of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In [5], Elnitsky constructed three elegant bijections between classes of reduced words for Type $\mathrm{A}$, $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ families of Coxeter groups and certain tilings of polygons. This paper offers a particular generalization of this concept to all finite Coxeter Groups in terms of embeddings into the Symmetric Group.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with two classes of Diophantine equations, $x^2+y^2+z^2+k_1yz+k_2zx+k_3xy=(3+k_1+k_2+k_3)xyz$ and $x^2+y^4+z^4+ky^2z^2+2xz^2+2xy^2=(7+k)xy^2z^2$, where $k_1,k_2,k_3,k$ are nonnegative integers. The former is known as the Markov Diophantine equation if $k_1=k_2=k_3=0$, and the latter is a Diophantine equation recently studied by Lampe if $k=0$. We give algorithms to enumerate all positive integer solutions to these equations, and discuss the structures of the generalized cluster algebras behind them.</description>

      <title>Representing Matroids over the Reals is $\exists \mathbb R$-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A matroid $M$ is an ordered pair $(E,I)$, where $E$ is a finite set called the ground set and a collection $I\subset 2^{E}$ called the independent sets which satisfy the conditions: (i) $\emptyset \in I$, (ii) $I'\subset I \in I$ implies $I'\in I$, and (iii) $I_1,I_2 \in I$ and $|I_1| &lt; |I_2|$ implies that there is an $e\in I_2$ such that $I_1\cup \{e\} \in I$. The rank $rank(M)$ of a matroid $M$ is the maximum size of an independent set. We say that a matroid $M=(E,I)$ is representable over the reals if there is a map $\varphi \colon E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{rank(M)}$ such that $I\in I$ if and only if $\varphi(I)$ forms a linearly independent set.
  We study the problem of matroid realizability over the reals. Given a matroid $M$, we ask whether there is a set of points in the Euclidean space representing $M$. We show that matroid realizability is $\exists \mathbb R$-complete, already for matroids of rank 3. The complexity class $\exists \mathbb R$ can be defined as the family of algorithmic problems that is polynomial-time is equivalent to determining if a multivariate polynomial with integers coefficients has a real root.
  Our methods are similar to previous methods from the literature. Yet, the result itself was never pointed out and there is no proof readily available in the language of computer science.</description>

      <title>Approximation and FPT Algorithms for Finding DM-Irreducible Spanning Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a minimum-weight strongly connected spanning subgraph of an edge-weighted directed graph is equivalent to the weighted version of the well-known strong connectivity augmentation problem, and it is NP-hard. For this problem, a simple $2$-approximation algorithm was proposed by Frederickson and J{\'a}j{\'a} (1981); surprisingly, it still achieves the best-known approximation ratio in general. Also, the unweighted problem was shown to be FPT (fixed-parameter tractable) by Bang-Jensen and Yeo (2008), if it is parameterized by the difference from the trivial upper bound of the optimal value. In this paper, we consider a generalized problem related to the Dulmage--Mendelsohn decompositions of bipartite graphs instead of the strong connectivity of directed graphs, and extend these approximation and FPT results to the generalized setting.</description>

      <title>Bohr recurrence and density of non-lacunary semigroups of $\mathbb{N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $R$ of integers is a set of Bohr recurrence if every rotation on $\mathbb{T}^d$ returns arbitrarily close to zero under some non-zero multiple of $R$. We show that the set $\{k!\, 2^m3^n\colon k,m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of Bohr recurrence. This is a particular case of a more general statement about images of such sets under any integer polynomial with zero constant term. We also show that if $P$ is a real polynomial with at least one non-constant irrational coefficient, then the set $\{P(2^m3^n)\colon m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{T}$, thus providing a joint generalization of two well-known results, one of Furstenberg and one of Weyl.</description>

      <title>Finding Spanning Trees with Perfect Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tractability of a simple fusion of two fundamental structures on graphs, a spanning tree and a perfect matching. Specifically, we consider the following problem: given an edge-weighted graph, find a minimum-weight spanning tree among those containing a perfect matching. On the positive side, we design a simple greedy algorithm for the case when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most two values. On the negative side, the problem is NP-hard even when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most three values, or when the graph is cubic, planar, and bipartite and the edge weights take at most two values.
  We also consider an interesting variant. We call a tree strongly balanced if on one side of the bipartition of the vertex set with respect to the tree, all but one of the vertices have degree $2$ and the remaining one is a leaf. This property is a sufficient condition for a tree to have a perfect matching, which enjoys an additional property. When the underlying graph is bipartite, strongly balanced spanning trees can be written as matroid intersection, and this fact was recently utilized to design an approximation algorithm for some kind of connectivity augmentation problem. The natural question is its tractability in nonbipartite graphs. As a negative answer, it turns out NP-hard to test whether a given graph has a strongly balanced spanning tree or not even when the graph is subcubic and planar.</description>
