      <title>ASRI: An Aggregated Systemic Risk Index for Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets have grown to represent over $3 trillion in capitalization, yet no unified index exists to monitor the systemic risks arising from the interconnection between decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and traditional financial institutions. This paper introduces the Aggregated Systemic Risk Index (ASRI), a composite measure comprising four weighted sub-indices: Stablecoin Concentration Risk (30%), DeFi Liquidity Risk (25%), Contagion Risk (25%), and Regulatory Opacity Risk (20%). We derive theoretical foundations for each component, specify quantitative formulas incorporating data from DeFi Llama, Federal Reserve FRED, and on-chain analytics, and validate the framework against historical crisis events including the Terra/Luna collapse (May 2022), the Celsius/3AC contagion (June 2022), the FTX bankruptcy (November 2022), and the SVB banking crisis (March 2023). Event study analysis detects statistically significant abnormal signals for all four crises (t-statistics 5.47-32.64, all p &lt; 0.01), though threshold-based operational detection identifies three of four events with an average lead time of 18 days. A three-regime Hidden Markov Model identifies distinct Low Risk, Moderate, and Elevated states with regime persistence exceeding 94%. Out-of-sample specificity testing on 2024-2025 data confirms zero false positives. The ASRI framework addresses a critical gap in existing risk monitoring by capturing DeFi-specific vulnerabilities -- composability risk, flash loan exposure, and tokenized real-world asset linkages -- that traditional systemic risk measures cannot accommodate.</description>

      <title>Taming Tail Risk in Financial Markets: Conformal Risk Control for Nonstationary Portfolio VaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk forecasts drive trading constraints and capital allocation, yet losses are nonstationary and regime-dependent. This paper studies sequential one-sided VaR control via conformal calibration. I propose regime-weighted conformal risk control (RWC), which calibrates a safety buffer from past forecast errors using exponential time decay and regime-similarity weights from regime features. RWC is model-agnostic and wraps any conditional quantile forecaster to target a desired exceedance rate. Finite-sample coverage is established under weighted exchangeability, and approximation bounds are derived under smoothly drifting regimes. On the CRSP U.S.\ equity portfolio, time-weighted conformal calibration is a strong default under drift, while regime weighting can improve regime-conditional stability in some settings with modest conservativeness changes.</description>
