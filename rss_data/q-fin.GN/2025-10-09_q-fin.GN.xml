      <title>Smart Contract-Enabled Procurement under Bounded Demand Variability: A Truncated Normal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a strategic procurement framework integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with bounded demand variability modeled through a truncated normal distribution. While existing research emphasizes the technical feasibility of smart contracts, the operational and economic implications of adoption under moderate uncertainty remain underexplored. We propose a multi-supplier model in which a centralized retailer jointly determines the optimal smart contract adoption intensity and supplier allocation decisions. The formulation endogenizes adoption costs, supplier digital readiness, and inventory penalties to capture realistic trade-offs among efficiency, sustainability, and profitability. Analytical results establish concavity and provide closed-form comparative statics for adoption thresholds and procurement quantities. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that moderate demand variability supports partial adoption strategies, whereas excessive investment in digital infrastructure can reduce overall profitability. Dynamic simulations further reveal how adaptive learning and declining implementation costs progressively enhance adoption intensity and supply chain performance. The findings provide theoretical and managerial insights for balancing digital transformation, resilience, and sustainability objectives in smart contract-enabled procurement.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Volatility of Bank Betas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research has shown banks match interest income and expense betas, and thereby obtain net interest income margins which are insensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The present analysis extends this research in a number of ways. First, we use state-space methods to estimate time-varying betas and test whether they are matched at each time interval. We find substantial variation in interest income and expense betas, which drives variation in net interest margin beta coefficients. Second, we estimate the time-varying conditional volatility of beta forecasts the uncertainty of future beta values. We find uncertainty in interest expense beta coefficients drives uncertainty in interest income betas. Further, large banks have greater expense beta uncertainty, whereas small banks have greater income beta uncertainty. Lastly, we find evidence that uncertainty in interest expense betas is priced by the market, and is negatively related to bank stock prices. This is a new and previously unmeasured source of unhedgeable risk in bank stocks, and highlights an additional benefit of the Federal Reserve's Zero Interest Rate Policy.</description>

      <title>Bloated Disclosures: Can ChatGPT Help Investors Process Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10224v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT can fundamentally change the way investors process information. We probe the economic usefulness of these tools in summarizing complex corporate disclosures using the stock market as a laboratory. The unconstrained summaries are remarkably shorter compared to the originals, whereas their information content is amplified. When a document has a positive (negative) sentiment, its summary becomes more positive (negative). Importantly, the summaries are more effective at explaining stock market reactions to the disclosed information. Motivated by these findings, we propose a measure of information ``bloat." We show that bloated disclosure is associated with adverse capital market consequences, such as lower price efficiency and higher information asymmetry. Finally, we show that the model is effective at constructing targeted summaries that identify firms' (non-)financial performance. Collectively, our results indicate that generative AI adds considerable value for investors with information processing constraints.</description>
