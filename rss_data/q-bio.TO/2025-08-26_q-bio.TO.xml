      <title>An integrated vertex model of the mesoderm invagination during the embryonic development of Drosophila</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mesoderm invagination of the Drosophila embryo is known as an archetypal morphogenic process. To explore the roles of the active cellular forces and the regulation of these forces, we developed an integrated vertex model that combines the regulation of morphogen expression with cell movements and tissue mechanics. Our results suggest that a successful furrow formation requires an apical tension gradient, decreased basal tension, and increased lateral tension, which corresponds to apical constriction, basal expansion, and apicobasal shortening respectively. Our model also considers the mechanical feedback which leads to an ectopic twist expression with external compression as observed in experiments. Our model predicts that ectopic invagination could happen if an external compressive gradient is applied.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Correlation between Force Output, Strains, and Pressure for Active Skeletal Muscle Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the forces of individual muscles in a muscle group around a joint is non-trivial, and researchers have suggested using surrogates for individual muscle forces instead. Traditionally, experimentalists have shown that the force output of the skeletal muscle tissue can be correlated to the intra-muscular pressure (IMP) generated by the muscle belly. However, IMP proves difficult to measure in vivo, due to variations from sensor placement and invasiveness of the procedure. Numerical biomechanical simulations offer a tool to analyze muscle contractions, enabling new insights into the correlations among non-invasive experimentally measurable quantities such as strains, and the force output. In this work, we investigate the correlations between the muscle force output, the principal, shear and volumetric strains experienced by the muscle, as well as the pressure developed within the muscle belly as the tissue undergoes isometric contractions with varying activation profiles and magnitudes. It is observed that pressure does not correlate well with force output under higher sub-maximal and maximal activation levels, especially at locations away from the center of the muscle belly due to pressure relaxation effects. This study reveals strong correlations between force output and the strains at all locations of the belly, irrespective of the type of activation considered. This observation offers evidence for further in vivo studies using experimentally measurable principal and volumetric strains in the muscle belly as proxies for the force generation by the individual muscle and consequently enables the estimation on the contribution of various muscle groups to the total force.</description>

      <title>Intestinal villi and crypts density maximizing nutrient absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The villi and crypts of the gastrointestinal tract increase the effective surface area of the intestinal mucosa, potentially enhancing nutrient absorption. It is commonly assumed that this is their primary function, and that a higher villi density necessarily leads to improved absorption. However, when villi are packed too closely together, diffusion can be hindered, potentially offsetting this benefit. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the density of these structures and the overall efficiency of absorption. In three different simplified geometries, approximating crypts, leaf-like villi, and finger-like villi we calculate analytically the concentration profile and the absorption flux, assuming that there is only diffusion between these structures while the lumen is well mixed. When plotting the absorption flux per unit of gut length as a function of the structures' density, we observe that there is a density maximizing absorption. We study numerically this optimum. It depends weakly on the absorption properties of the given nutrient, so that a geometry optimal for one nutrient is close to optimum for another nutrient. Physiological data from various animal species align with this predicted optimal range and potentially reflect evolutionary selection for efficient nutrient uptake, supporting the model's validity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Imaging: Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogates for 3D+T Biological Tissue Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic organization and homeostasis of living tissues requires high-resolution, time-resolved imaging coupled with methods capable of extracting interpretable, predictive insights from complex datasets. Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.</description>
