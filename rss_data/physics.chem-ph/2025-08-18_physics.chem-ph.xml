      <title>Interactive framework for techno-economic meta-analysis of marine hydrogen transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a result of the wide span of uncertainties and input variables considered in recent peer-reviewed studies on hydrogen supply chains, consensus and generalized insight are hard to derive. This work presents a meta-analysis model, building upon a growing database of literature cost estimations and enabling dynamic investigation and comparison of hydrogen transportation chains under varying input scenarios. Also built into the framework is the evaluation of the impact of costing methodology and shipping fuel type. A convenient online interface allows to leverage increasing amounts of underlying cost data and assists users in gaining insight into generalized cost dynamics attributes. The method and toolbox are demonstrated via in-depth analysis of compressed hydrogen (GH2), liquefied hydrogen (LH2), dibenzyltoluene (LOHC) and ammonia as hydrogen carriers. Confined hydrogen clathrate hydrates are used as an example to demonstrate how one can deal with lower-TRL candidate technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical measurement of saturation vapor pressures below and above room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the implementation of a dynamical method for the determination -- in an extended temperature range around room temperature -- of the saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization of low-volatility liquid substances. The method relies on isolating a \textit{precooled} substance in a heated chamber under static vacuum conditions and monitoring the chamber pressure as the sample slowly thermalizes to the chamber temperature. We apply the method to four reference substances -- diethyl phthalate, 1-decanol, 1-heptanol, and 1-hexanol -- and provide accurate data for their saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization in the range from $-10$ to $35^\circ$C.</description>

      <title>Unphysical Solutions in Coupled-Cluster-Based Random Phase Approximation and How to Avoid Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD)-based random phase approximation (RPA) has provided an attractive framework for the development and application of RPA-related methods. However, a potential unphysical solution issue recently reported by Rekkedal and co-workers (J. Chem. Phys. 139, 081101, 2013) has raised significant concerns regarding the general applicability of coupled-cluster-based RPA, particularly in small-gap systems where RPA is anticipated to outperform commonly employed second-order perturbation theory. In this work, we elucidate the underlying origin of the multi-solution issue in drCCD and develop both a practical criterion for validating drCCD solutions and improved preconditioners based on level shifting and regularized MP2 methods for stabilizing the iterative solution of the drCCD equation. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach through representative systems -- including molecules with stretched bonds, large conjugated systems, and metallic clusters -- where standard drCCD iteration encounters convergence difficulties. Furthermore, we extend our approach to various recently developed reduced-scaling drCCD-based RPA methods, thereby establishing a foundation for their stable application to large-scale problems. The extension of our approach to RPA with exchange, quasiparticle RPA, and particle-particle RPA is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral Phonons in Graphyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, quantized lattice vibrations with circular polarization and non-zero angular momentum, offer new perspectives for phononic and quantum device engineering. Graphyne could be a promising candidate due to its unique lattice geometry, valley-structured electronic bands, and thermal transport capabilities. However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to the existence of inversion ($\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathscr{T}$) symmetries. Herein, we have demonstrated the existence of chiral phonons in graphynes, achieved by breaking combined $\mathscr{PT}$ symmetry through atomic-selective substitutional doping. We find that the B, N, dopants and ortho BN co-dopant in 6-6-12 and $\gamma$-graphynes induce localized structural deformations. These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\Gamma$ point and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further established a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and electron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron density which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with electronic environment. This in turn increases phonon angular momentum, indicating potential role of electron-phonon interactions in angular momentum modulation of chiral phonons. Our prosposed approach provides a tunable route for controlling chiral phonon behavior, paving way for development of advanced phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for coated plasmonic particles: effects of shape and size-corrected dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, modal expansion methods (MEMs) were developed to accurately predict the extinction and scattering spectra of bare and coated plasmonic particles. However, it remains uncertain whether the accuracy of analytical models is preserved when incorporating size-corrected dielectric functions. We compare numerical (COMSOL) and analytical extinction and scattering spectra for various particle shapes - rods, disks, prisms, bicones, and bipyramids - using both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. Size correction primarily causes broadening and a reduction in the plasmonic peaks. Still, the accuracy of analytical models is maintained for all shapes except sharp bicones, where MEM fails for both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. This failure arises from the strong localization of the plasmonic field near the sharp bicone tips. However, for realistic bicone models with nanometer-scale tip curvature, MEM performs well.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Sensing of Excited-State Dynamics with Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The squeezed photons, as a quantum-correlated light with reduced noise, have emerged as a great resource for sensing the structures of matter. Here we study the transient absorption (TA) scheme using the squeezed photons whose spectral correlation of amplitudes can be tailored. A microscopic theory is developed, revealing a highly time-energy-resolved nature of the signal that is not attainable by conventional TA scheme. Such a capability is elaborated by applying to monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDs), achieving a real-time monitoring of valley excitons and their dynamics. Moreover, we show the intermediate squeezing regime-not the strong squeezing-which the time-resolved spectroscopy is in favor of. Our work offers a new paradigm for studying nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, in light of the photocatalysis and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: library for efficient training, model development and simulation of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) are a novel in silico approach for molecular property prediction, creating an alternative to disrupt the accuracy/speed trade-off of empirical force fields and density functional theory (DFT). In this white paper, we present our MLIP library which was created with two core aims: (1) provide to industry experts without machine learning background a user-friendly and computationally efficient set of tools to experiment with MLIP models, (2) provide machine learning developers a framework to develop novel approaches fully integrated with molecular dynamics tools. The library includes in this release three model architectures (MACE, NequIP, and ViSNet), and two molecular dynamics (MD) wrappers (ASE, and JAX-MD), along with a set of pre-trained organics models. The seamless integration with JAX-MD, in particular, facilitates highly efficient MD simulations, bringing MLIP models significantly closer to industrial application. The library is available on GitHub and on PyPI under the Apache license 2.0.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often interferes with these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows inside a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporation and resulting Marangoni flows, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our analysis shows that here solutal Marangoni forces are more relevant than thermal ones. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that is simultaneously memory-efficient and low-scaling for applying ab initio molecular Hamiltonians to matrix-product states (MPS) via the tensor-hypercontraction (THC) format. These gains carry over to Krylov subspace methods, which can find low-lying eigenstates and simulate quantum time evolution while avoiding local minima and maintaining high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only 2. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in MPS form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method using a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. Our algorithm is highly parallelizable and thus lends itself to large-scale HPC simulations.</description>
