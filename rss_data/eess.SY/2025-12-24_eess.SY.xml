      <title>A Class of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Laws for Rotational Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of attitude control laws for rotational systems, which generalizes the use of the Euler axis-angle representation beyond quaternion-based formulations. Using basic Lyapunov's stability theory and the notion of extended $K_{\infty}$ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis-angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the recorded data, in the execution of high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers, the new method consistently achieves shorter stabilization times and requires lower control effort relative to those corresponding to the quaternion-based and geometric-control methods used as benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HeylandCircle: A Computational Framework for the Geometric Reconstruction of the Heyland Circle Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heyland circle diagram is a classical graphical tool for representing the steady-state behavior of induction machines using no-load and blocked-rotor test data. While widely used in alternating-current machinery texts, the diagram is typically presented as a hand-constructed aid and lacks a standardized computational formulation. This paper presents HeylandCircle, a computational framework that reconstructs the classical Heyland circle diagram directly from standard test parameters. The framework formalizes the traditional geometric construction as a deterministic, reproducible sequence of geometric operations, establishing a clear mapping between measured data, fixed geometric objects, and steady-state operating points. Quantities such as power factor, slip, output power, torque, and efficiency are obtained through explicit geometric relationships on the constructed diagram. Validation using a representative textbook example demonstrates close agreement with classical results. The framework provides a computational realization of the traditional Heyland diagram suitable for instruction, analysis, and systematic extension.</description>

      <title>From Dissipativity Property to Data-Driven GAS Certificate of Degree-One Homogeneous Networks with Unknown Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven divide and conquer strategy for the stability analysis of interconnected homogeneous nonlinear networks of degree one with unknown models and a fully unknown topology. The proposed scheme leverages joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems described by storage functions, while providing a stability certificate over unknown interconnected networks. In our data-driven framework, we begin by formulating the required conditions for constructing storage functions as a robust convex program (RCP). Given that unknown models of subsystems are integrated into one of the constraints of the RCP, we collect data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem and provide a scenario convex program (SCP) that aligns with the original RCP. We solve the SCP as a linear program and construct a storage function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics. Under some newly developed data-driven compositionality conditions, we then construct a Lyapunov function for the fully unknown interconnected network utilizing storage functions derived from data of individual subsystems. We show that our data-driven {divide and conquer strategy} provides correctness guarantees (as opposed to probabilistic confidence) while significantly mitigating the sample complexity problem existing in data-driven approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed results, we apply our approaches to three different case studies involving interconnected homogeneous (nonlinear) networks with unknown models. We collect data from trajectories of unknown subsystems and verify the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the interconnected system with a guaranteed confidence.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Embedded Index Coding and Beamforming for MIMO-based Distributed Computing via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a robust safety-critical control method for nonlinear strictfeedback systems with mismatched disturbances. Using a state transformation and a linear time-varying disturbance observer, the system is converted into a form that enables safe control design. The approach ensures forward invariance of the safety set and also applies to disturbancefree systems. Safety is proven for all cases, and a numerical example illustrates the results.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Control Based on Differential Flatness for Wheeled Mobile Robots with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust tracking control strategy is designed to empower wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) to track predetermined routes while operating in diverse fields and encountering disturbances like strong winds or uneven path conditions, which affect tracking performance. Ensuring the applicability of this tracking method in real-world scenarios is essential. To accomplish this, the WMR model is initially transformed into a linear canonical form by leveraging the differential flatness of its kinematic model, facilitating controller design. Subsequently, a novel integral nonlinear hyperplane-based sliding mode control (INH-SMC) technique is proposed for WMR under disturbances. The stability of the technique is analyzed and verified. Finally, its practical viability is demonstrated through a comparative real-world indoor experiment on a TurtleBot3 WMR subjected to disturbances, confirming the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sliding Mode Control for a Parabolic-Elliptic PDE System with Boundary Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the robustness of parabolic-elliptic systems under boundary control. A sliding mode control strategy is proposed to reject matched perturbations. The stability analysis establishes finite-time convergence of the sliding manifold and exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Since the closed-loop system is discontinuous, we also prove its well-posedness. A numerical example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Inference in Latent Force Models Using Optimal State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent force models, a class of hybrid modeling approaches, integrate physical knowledge of system dynamics with a latent force - an unknown, unmeasurable input modeled as a Gaussian process. In this work, we introduce two optimal state estimation frameworks to reconstruct the latent forces and to estimate the states. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, the designed estimators enable the consideration of system-inherent constraints. Finally, the performance of the novel frameworks is investigated in several numerical examples. In particular, we demonstrate the performance of the new framework in a real-world biomedical example - the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis - using hormone measurements.</description>

      <title>Data-based Moving Horizon Estimation under Irregularly Measured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a sample- and data-based moving horizon estimation framework for linear systems. We perform state estimation in a sample-based fashion in the sense that we assume to have only few, irregular output measurements available. This setting is encountered in applications where measuring is expensive or time-consuming. Furthermore, the state estimation framework does not rely on a standard mathematical model, but on an implicit system representation based on measured data. We prove sample-based practical robust exponential stability of the proposed estimator under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we apply the proposed scheme to estimate the states of a gastrointestinal tract absorption system.</description>

      <title>Divergence Method to Stability Study of Andronov-Vyshnegradsky Problem. Hidden Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Andronov-Vyshnegradsky problem, which deals with locating regions of stability and oscillations in control systems with a Watt regulator, is solved using a divergence method for studying the stability of dynamic systems. This system is studied both with and without the self-regulation effect. The exact value of the hidden boundary of the global stability region is obtained. The stability criteria for a system with a Watt regulator are also presented in the context of the solvability of a linear matrix inequality. Computer modelling shows that the system exhibits hidden oscillations when the self-regulation effect is present and when it is not. The conditions for computing the hidden boundary of global stability are determined by three parameters in the Watt regulator model.</description>

      <title>Fast Fixed-time Convergence in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast convergence in a fixed-time of solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems, for which special requirements are satisfied on the derivative of a quadratic function calculated along the solutions of the system, is proposed. The conditions for the system solutions to converge to zero and to a given region within a fixed-time are obtained. To achieve fast convergence, a negative power is applied to the derivative of a quadratic function within a specific time interval during the evolution of the system. The application of the proposed results to the design of control laws for arbitrary order linear plants using the backstepping method is considered. All the main results are accompanied by numerical modelling and a comparison of the proposed solutions with some existing ones.</description>

      <title>Modeling Economic Systems as Multiport Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate how multiport network theory can be used as a powerful modeling tool in economics. The critical insight is using the port concept to pair the flow of goods (the electrical current) with the agent's incentive (the voltage) in an economic interaction. By building networks of agents interacting through ports, we create models with multiple levels of abstraction, from the macro level down to the micro level. We are thereby able to model complex macroeconomic systems whose dynamical behavior is emergent from the micro level. Using the LTSpice circuit simulator, we then design and analyze a series of example systems that range in complexity from the textbook Robinson Crusoe economy to a model of an entire economy.</description>

      <title>A Time-efficient Prioritised Scheduling Algorithm to Optimise Initial Flock Formation of Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drone applications continue to expand across various domains, with flocking offering enhanced cooperative capabilities but introducing significant challenges during initial formation. Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel data-driven framework and the first-ever county-scale application of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) to forecast composite sustainability indices from herd-level operational records. The methodology employs a novel, end-to-end pipeline utilizing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to augment Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) datasets, preserving joint distributions while mitigating sparsity. A first-ever pillar-based scoring formulation is derived via Principal Component Analysis, identifying Reproductive Efficiency, Genetic Management, Herd Health, and Herd Management, to construct weighted composite indices. These indices are modelled using a novel STGNN architecture that explicitly encodes geographic dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics to generate multi-year forecasts for 2026-2030.</description>

      <title>$\mathscr{H}_2$ Model Reduction for Augmented Model of Linear Non-Markovian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An augmented system model provides an effective way to model non-Markovian quantum systems, which is useful in filtering and control for this class of systems. However, since a large number of ancillary quantum oscillators representing internal modes of a non-Markovian environment directly interact with the principal system in these models, the dimension of the augmented system may be very large causing significant computational burden in designing filters and controllers. In this context, this paper proposes an $\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.
  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Policy for Learning Controllable Dynamics by Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial to Multirate Extended Kalman Filter Design for Monitoring of Agricultural Anaerobic Digestion Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications of biotechnology, measurements are available at different sampling rates, e.g., due to online sensors and offline lab analysis. Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid.</description>

      <title>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \&amp; Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</description>

      <title>Expected Revenue, Risk, and Grid Impact of Bitcoin Mining: A Decision-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current assessments use ex post proxies that miss uncertainty and fail to consistently capture the rapid change in bitcoin mining. We introduce a unified, ex ante statistical model that derives expected return, downside risk, and upside potential profit from the first principles of mining: Each hash is a Bernoulli trial with a Bitcoin block difficulty-based success probability. The model yields closed-form expected revenue per hash-rate unit, risk metrics in different scenarios, and upside-profit probabilities for different fleet sizes. Empirical calibration closely matches previously reported observations, yielding a unified, faithful quantification across hardware, pools, and operating conditions. This foundation enables more reliable analysis of mining impacts and behavior.</description>

      <title>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Multiple-Scattering Channel Modeling for Ultraviolet Communications: A Monte-Carlo Integration Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling of multiple-scattering channels in atmospheric turbulence is essential for the performance analysis of long-distance non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) communications. Existing works on the turbulent channel modeling for NLOS UV communications either focused on single-scattering cases or estimate the turbulent fluctuation effect in an unreliable way based on Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) approach. In this paper, we establish a comprehensive turbulent multiple-scattering channel model by using a more efficient Monte-Carlo integration (MCI) approach for NLOS UV communications, where both the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects are considered. Compared with the MCS approach, the MCI approach is more interpretable for estimating the turbulent fluctuation. To achieve this, we first introduce the scattering, absorption, and turbulence effects for NLOS UV communications in turbulent channels. Then we propose the estimation methods based on MCI approach for estimating both the turbulent fluctuation and the distribution of turbulent fading coefficient. Numerical results demonstrate that the turbulence-induced scattering effect can always be ignored for typical UV communication scenarios. Besides, the turbulent fluctuation will increase as either the communication distance increases or the zenith angle decreases, which is compatible with existing experimental results and also with our experimental results. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that the distribution of the turbulent fading coefficient for UV multiple-scattering channels under all turbulent conditions can be approximated as log-normal distribution; and we also demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that the turbulent fading can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution under weak turbulence.</description>

      <title>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</description>

      <title>Learning Stack-of-Tasks Management for Redundant Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automatically learning complete Stack-of-Tasks (SoT) controllers for redundant robotic systems, including task priorities, activation logic, and control parameters. Unlike classical SoT pipelines-where task hierarchies are manually defined and tuned-our approach optimizes the full SoT structure directly from a user-specified cost function encoding intuitive preferences such as safety, precision, manipulability, or execution speed. The method combines Genetic Programming with simulation-based evaluation to explore both discrete (priority order, task activation) and continuous (gains, trajectory durations) components of the controller. We validate the framework on a dual-arm mobile manipulator (the ABB mobile-YuMi research platform), demonstrating robust convergence across multiple cost definitions, automatic suppression of irrelevant tasks, and strong resilience to distractors. Learned SoTs exhibit expert-like hierarchical structure and adapt naturally to multi-objective trade-offs. Crucially, all controllers transfer from Gazebo simulation to the real robot, achieving safe and precise motion without additional tuning. Experiments in static and dynamic environments show reliable obstacle avoidance, high tracking accuracy, and predictable behavior in the presence of humans. The proposed method provides an interpretable and scalable alternative to manual SoT design, enabling rapid, user-driven generation of task execution hierarchies for complex robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Dynamical Modeling of Extrusion-Based 3D Printing Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trade-off between model fidelity and computational cost remains a central challenge in the computational modeling of extrusion-based 3D printing, particularly for real time optimization and control. Although high fidelity simulations have advanced considerably for offline analysis, dynamical modeling tailored for online, control-oriented applications is still significantly underdeveloped. In this study, we propose a reduced order dynamical flow model that captures the transient behavior of extrusion-based 3D printing. The model is grounded in physics-based principles derived from the Navier Stokes equations and further simplified through spatial averaging and input dependent parameterization. To assess its performance, the model is identified via a nonlinear least squares approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data spanning a range of printing conditions and subsequently validated across multiple combinations of training and testing scenarios. The results demonstrate strong agreement with the CFD data within the nozzle, the nozzle substrate gap, and the deposited layer regions. Overall, the proposed reduced order model successfully captures the dominant flow dynamics of the process while maintaining a level of simplicity compatible with real time control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\"at W\"urzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universit\"at Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.</description>
