      <title>Preparing students for the quantum information revolution: Interdisciplinary teaching, curriculum development, and advising in quantum information science and engineering</title>

Abstract: As the field of quantum information science and engineering (QISE) continues its rapid growth, there are increasing concerns about the workforce demands and the necessity of preparing students for quantum-related careers. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, it is necessary to offer diverse educational opportunities to ensure that students are well-prepared for careers emerging from the second quantum revolution. In this paper, we present our findings from a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with university QISE educators, who have taken on the challenges and opportunities in developing QISE courses and curricula for undergraduate and graduate students from different academic backgrounds. Our findings focus on common themes across undergraduate and graduate QISE education, as well as advising and mentoring students to prepare them for research in the field. The interviewees discussed the various strategies they had implemented, such as incorporating hands-on lab activities, integration of Python coding with Qiskit, and including project-based learning experiences. Furthermore, their reflections on mentorship and advising students emphasized the importance of recognizing students' prior preparation, providing targeted resources, and supportive learning environments. Our findings are meant to provide guidance for educators looking to implement effective QISE educational strategies that address the changing landscape of quantum information revolution.</description>

      <title>Beyond named methods: A typology of active learning based on classroom observation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of introductory physics instructors are implementing active learning methods in their classrooms, and they are modifying the methods to fit their local instructional contexts. However, we lack a detailed framework for describing the range of what these instructor adaptations of active learning methods look like in practice. Existing studies apply structured protocols to classroom observations and report descriptive statistics, but this approach overlooks the complex nature of instruction. In this study, we apply network analysis to classroom observations to define a typology of active learning that considers the temporal and interactional nature of instructional practices. We use video data from 30 instructors at 27 institutions who implemented one of the following named active learning methods in their introductory physics or astronomy course: Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), Peer Instruction, Tutorials, and Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP). We identify five types of active learning instruction: clicker lecture, dialogic clicker lecture, dialogic lecture with short groupwork activities, short groupwork activities, and long groupwork activities. We find no significant relationship between these instruction types and the named active learning methods; instead, implementations of each of the four methods are spread across different instruction types. This result prompts a shift in the way we think and talk about active learning: the names of developed active learning methods may not actually reflect the specific activities that happen during instruction. We also find that student conceptual learning does not vary across the identified instruction types, suggesting that instructors may be flexible when modifying these methods without sacrificing effectiveness.</description>
