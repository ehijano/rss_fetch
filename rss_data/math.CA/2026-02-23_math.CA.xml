      <title>Sharp estimates for the Fourier transform of surface-carried measures and maximal operators associated with hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with vanishing Gaussian curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study problems related to harmonic analysis on hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4 $ with zero Gaussian curvature and given as graphs of polynomial functions. We derive sharp uniform estimates with respect to the direction of frequencies for the Fourier transform of measures supported on such hypersurfaces. Additionally, we study the $L^p$-boundedness problem of maximal operators associated with hypersurfaces. We determine the exact value of the boundedness exponent in terms of the heights of these hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Helical maximal function and weighted estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize the range of $\alpha$ for which the helical maximal function is bounded from $L^p(|x|^\alpha)$ to itself for $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Our result is optimal for $4\leq p&lt;\infty,$ except possibly at end-points.</description>

      <title>Conditional thinning and multiplicative statistics of Laguerre-type orthogonal polynomial ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles near a hard edge, subject to a multiplicative deformation of the measure. Probabilistically, this deformation corresponds to a position-dependent conditional thinning of the particles. We prove that, under critical hard edge scaling and for a large class of potentials and deformation symbols, the correlation kernel of the conditional ensemble converges to a universal limit, which we identify as the conditional thinned Bessel point process.
  We derive an explicit expression for this limiting kernel in terms of the solution to a nonlocal integrable system depending on a parameter. For a special choice of the parameter, this system was recently identified in the study of multiplicative statistics of the Bessel point process. Our results establish that this system governs the full correlation structure of the conditional Bessel point process, extending the classical connection between the standard Bessel kernel and the Painlev\'e V equation.</description>

      <title>Assouad-like dimensions of a class of random Moran measures II -- non-homogeneous Moran sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the almost sure values of the $\Phi$-dimensions of random measures $\mu$ supported on random Moran sets in $\R^d$ that satisfy a uniform separation condition. This paper generalizes earlier work done on random measures on homogeneous Moran sets \cite{HM} to the case of unequal scaling factors. The $\Phi$-dimensions are intermediate Assouad-like dimensions with the (quasi-)Assouad dimensions and the $\theta$-Assouad spectrum being special cases.
  The almost sure value of $\dim_\Phi \mu$ exhibits a threshold phenomena, with one value for ``large'' $\Phi$ (with the quasi-Assouad dimension as an example of a ``large'' dimension) and another for ``small'' $\Phi$ (with the Assouad dimension as an example of a ``small'' dimension). We give many applications, including where the scaling factors are fixed and the probabilities are uniformly distributed. The almost sure $\Phi$ dimension of the underlying random set is also a consequence of our results.</description>

      <title>A uniform rate of convergence for the entropic potentials in the quadratic Euclidean setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We bound the rate of uniform convergence in compact sets for both entropic potentials and their gradients towards the Brenier potential and its gradient, respectively. Both results hold in the quadratic Euclidean setting for absolutely continuous measures satisfying some convexity assumptions.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Laplace Transforms compared: the basic confluent hypergeometric function ${}_2\phi_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In solving $q$-difference equations, and in the definition of $q$-special functions, we encounter formal power series in which the $n$th coefficient is of size $q^{-\binom{n}{2}}$ with $q\in(0,1)$ fixed. To make sense of these formal series, a $q$-Borel-Laplace resummation is required. There are three candidates for the $q$-Laplace transform, resulting in three different resummations. Surprisingly, the differences between these resummations have hardly been discussed in the literature.
  Our main result provides explicit formulas for these $q$-exponentially small differences. We also give simple Mellin--Barnes integral representations for all the basic hypergeometric ${}_r\phi_s$ functions and derive a third (discrete) orthogonality condition for the Stieltjes--Wigert polynomials.
  As the main application, we introduce three resummations for the ${}_2\phi_0$ functions which can be seen as $q$ versions of the Kummer $U$ functions. We derive many of their properties, including interesting integral and sum representations, connection formulas, and error bounds.</description>
