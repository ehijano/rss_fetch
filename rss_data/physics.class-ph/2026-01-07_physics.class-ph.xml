      <title>Resonances in b-EMRIs: playing the black hole piano</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binaries evolving in the vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be common in the universe, either in active galactic nuclei or in other astrophysical environments. Here, we study in detail the resonant excitation of SMBH modes driven by a nearby stellar-mass binary. The resulting resonant energy fluxes vary with the orbital location and frequency of the binary, exhibiting a rich and complex structure. In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical-Time Framework for the Dynamics of Charged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dynamical framework for modeling the motion of point-like charged particles, with or without mass, in general external electromagnetic fields. A key feature of this formulation is the treatment of time coordinate as a dynamical variable. The framework applies to the relativistic regime while consistently admitting a nonrelativistic limit. We also introduce a representation of particle trajectories in velocity space, which provides clear insight into the nature and asymptotic behavior of the dynamics. As an application, we compare the motion of massive and massless particles in a constant electromagnetic field and find that, for identical field configurations, their asymptotic behavior is independent of both mass and initial conditions. Finally, we explore the computational advantages of the dynamical-time formulation over the conventional uniform-time approach in two case studies: a uniform electromagnetic field, and an elliptically polarized wave propagating along a uniform magnetic field. In both scenarios, the proposed scheme exhibits improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations for multi-terminal systems with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Based on our proposed exact bounds, the analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.</description>

      <title>Geometric integrators for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>
