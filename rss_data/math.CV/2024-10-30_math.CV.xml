      <title>Segal-Bargmann transform for generalized partial-slice monogenic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions has been recently introduced to include the two theories of monogenic functions and of slice monogenic functions over Clifford algebras. The main purpose of this article is to develop the Segal-Bargmann transform and give a Schr\"{o}dinger representation in the setting of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions. To this end, the generalized partial-slice Cauchy-Kovalevskaya extension plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Three radii associated to Schur functions on the polydisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines three radii associated to bounded analytic functions on the polydisk: the well-known Bohr radius, the Bohr-Agler radius, and the Schur-Agler radius. We prove explicit upper and lower bounds for the Bohr-Agler radius, an explicit lower bound for the Schur-Agler radius, and an asymptotic upper bound for the Schur-Agler radius. The Bohr-Agler radius obeys the same (known) asymptotic as the Bohr radius while we show the Schur-Agler radius is roughly of the same growth as the Bohr radius. As a corollary, we bound the Bohr radius on the bidisk below by 0.3006. Finally, we improve some estimates of P.G. Dixon on Agler norms of homogeneous polynomials using some modern inequalities.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space of Complex-Valued Harmonic Functions in the Unit Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an extended version of Hilbert space of analytic functions called Hilbert space of complex-valued harmonic functions. It is found that functions in Hilbert space of complex-valued harmonic functions exhibit many properties analogous to its analytic counter part such as complex-valued harmonic function analogous of norm, equivalent norms, reproducing kernels, growth estimates and Littlewood-Paley Identity Theorem. In conclusion we prove that many results in Hilbert space of analytic functions also hold in larger Hilbert space of complex-valued harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Piecewise geodesic Jordan curves II: Loewner energy, projective structures, and accessory parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a Jordan curve on the Riemann sphere passing through $n \ge 3$ given points. We show that in each relative isotopy class of such curves, there exists a unique curve that minimizes the Loewner energy. These curves have the property that each arc between two consecutive points is a hyperbolic geodesic in the domain bounded by the other arcs. This geodesic property lets us define a complex projective structure on the punctured sphere. We show that its associated quadratic differential has simple poles, whose residues (accessory parameters) are given by the Wirtinger derivatives of the minimal Loewner energy, a result resembling Polyakov's conjecture for the Fuchsian projective structure that was later proven by Takhtajan and Zograf. Finally, we show that the projective structures we obtain are related to the Fuchsian projective structures via a $\pi$-grafting.</description>

      <title>Multiple Radial SLE(0) and Classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the multiple radial SLE(0) systems as the deterministic limit of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  As a consequence of domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we derive that a multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) system is characterized by a conformally covariant partition function satisfying the null vector equations--a second-order PDE system. On the other hand, using the Coulomb gas method inspired by conformal field theory, we construct conformally covariant solutions to the null vector equations, which can be classified according to topological link patterns.
  We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the classical limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the growth points and form a radial link pattern.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the fermionic states. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity, form a special class of classical CS systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <title>On Generators of the Hardy and the Bergman Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A function which is analytic and bounded in the Unit disk is called a generator for the Hardy space or the Bergman space if polynomials in that function are dense in the corresponding space. We characterize generators in terms of sub-spaces which are invariant under multiplication by the generator and also invariant under multiplication by z, and study wandering properties of such sub-spaces. Density of bounded analytic functions in the sub-spaces of the Hardy space which are invariant under multiplication by the generator is also investigated.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the Bernstein-Walsh-Siciak theorem on polynomial approximation in $\mathbb{C}^n$ to the case where the polynomial ring $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ is replaced by a subring $\mathcal{P}^S(\mathbb{C}^n)$ consisting of all polynomials with exponents restricted to sets $mS$, where $S$ is a compact convex subset of $\mathbb{R}_+^n$ with $0 \in S$ and $m = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$, and uniform estimates of error in the approximation are replaced by weighted uniform estimates with respect to an admissible weight function.</description>

Abstract: To a complex polynomial function $f$ with arbitrary singularities we associate the number of Morse points in a general linear Morsification $f_{t} := f - t\ell$. We produce computable algebraic formulas in terms of invariants of $f$ for the numbers of stratwise Morse trajectories which abut, as $t\to 0$, to some point of the space or at infinity.</description>

      <title>Genus $g$ Zhu Recursion for Vertex Operator Algebras and Their Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe Zhu recursion for a vertex operator algebra (VOA) and its modules on a genus $g$ Riemann surface in the Schottky uniformisation. We show that $n$-point (intertwiner) correlation functions are written as linear combinations of $(n-1)$-point functions with universal coefficients given by derivatives of the differential of the third kind, the Bers quasiform and certain holomorphic forms. We use this formula to describe conformal Ward identities framed in terms of a canonical differential operator which acts with respect to the Schottky moduli and to the insertion points of the $n$-point function. We consider the generalised Heisenberg VOA and determine all its correlation functions by Zhu recursion. We also use Zhu recursion to derive linear partial differential equations for the Heisenberg VOA partition function and various structures such as the bidifferential of the second kind, holomorphic $1$-forms, the prime form and the period matrix. Finally, we compute the genus $g$ partition function for any rational Euclidean lattice generalised VOA.</description>

      <title>Log-Lipschitz and H\"older regularity imply smoothness for complex analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove metric analogues, in any dimension and in any co-dimension, of the famous Theorem of Mumford on smoothness of normal surfaces and the beautiful Theorem of Ramanujam that gives a topological characterization of $\mathbb{C}^2$ as an algebraic surface. For instance, we prove that a complex analytic set that is log-Lipschitz regular at 0 (i.e., a complex analytic set that has a neighbourhood of the origin which bi-log-Lipschitz homeomorphic to an Euclidean ball) must be smooth at 0. We prove even more, we prove that if a complex analytic set $X$ such that, for each $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $(X,0)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^k,0)$ are bi-$\alpha$-H\"older homeomorphic, then $X$ must be smooth at 0. These results generalize the Lipschitz Regularity Theorem, which says that a Lipschitz regular complex analytic set must be smooth. Global versions of these results are also presented here and, in particular, we obtain a characterization of an affine linear subspace as a pure-dimensional entire complex analytic set.</description>
