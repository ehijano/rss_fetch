      <title>ReMAC:Digital Multiple Access Computing by Repeated Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the ChannelComp framework, where multiple transmitters aim to compute a function of their values at a common receiver while using digital modulations over a multiple access channel. ChannelComp provides a general framework for computation by designing digital constellations for over-the-air computation. Currently, ChannelComp uses a symbol-level encoding. However, encoding repeated transmissions of the same symbol and performing the function computation using the corresponding received sequence may significantly improve the computation performance and reduce the encoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new scheme where each transmitter repeats the transmission of the same symbol over multiple time slots while encoding such repetitions and designing constellation diagrams to minimize computational errors. We formally model such a scheme by an optimization problem, whose solution jointly identifies the constellation diagram and the repetition code. We call the proposed scheme ReMAC. To manage the computational complexity of the optimization, we divide it into two tractable subproblems. We verify the performance of ReMAC by numerical experiments. The simulation results reveal that ReMAC can reduce the computation error in noisy and fading channels by approximately up to 7.5$dB compared to standard ChannelComp, particularly for product functions.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Model for Massive MIMO Precoding Across Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) technology has transformed wireless communication by enhancing spectral efficiency and network capacity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based mMIMO precoder to tackle the complexity challenges of existing approaches, such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), while leveraging meta-learning domain generalization and a teacher-student architecture to improve generalization across diverse communication environments. When deployed to a previously unseen site, the proposed model achieves excellent sum-rate performance while maintaining low computational complexity by avoiding matrix inversions and by using a simpler neural network structure. The model is trained and tested on a custom ray-tracing dataset composed of several base station locations. The experimental results indicate that our method effectively balances computational efficiency with high sum-rate performance while showcasing strong generalization performance in unseen environments. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed model outperforms WMMSE across all tested sites and SNR conditions while reducing complexity by at least 73$\times$.</description>

      <title>Compression of Site-Specific Deep Neural Networks for Massive MIMO Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning (DL) models for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems is often constrained by high computational demands and energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the compute energy efficiency of mMIMO precoders using DL-based approaches, comparing them to conventional methods such as zero forcing and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE). Our energy consumption model accounts for both memory access and calculation energy within DL accelerators. We propose a framework that incorporates mixed-precision quantization-aware training and neural architecture search to reduce energy usage without compromising accuracy. Using a ray-tracing dataset covering various base station sites, we analyze how site-specific conditions affect the energy efficiency of compressed models. Our results show that deep neural network compression generates precoders with up to 35 times higher energy efficiency than WMMSE at equal performance, depending on the scenario and the desired rate. These results establish a foundation and a benchmark for the development of energy-efficient DL-based mMIMO precoders.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous directional channel measurements at 14 GHz and 160 GHz via a virtual circular array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper a novel frequency-scalable rotary platform design is introduced which allows for flexible directional channel measurements using different types of antennas, and which can also be used with frequency extenders for measurements up to the THz region. The measurement platform has been applied to measure the channel properties including the direction of arrival at the FR3 frequency 14 GHz and in the D-band at 160 GHz in a large hall indoor environment with LOS distances up to 40 m. The results show very good agreement of strong path components for both frequencies as well as interesting dependencies of delay spread, angular spread, and Ricean K- factor on distance and frequency and can be used to parameterize a path loss model.</description>

      <title>A procedure for assessing of machine health index data prediction quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper discusses the challenge of evaluating the prognosis quality of machine health index (HI) data. Many existing solutions in machine health forecasting involve visually assessing the quality of predictions to roughly gauge the similarity between predicted and actual samples, lacking precise measures or decisions. In this paper, we introduce a universal procedure with multiple variants and criteria. The overarching concept involves comparing predicted data with true HI time series, but each procedure variant has a specific pattern determined through statistical analysis. Additionally, a statistically established threshold is employed to classify the result as either a reliable or non-reliable prognosis. The criteria include both simple measures (MSE, MAPE) and more advanced ones (Space quantiles-inclusion factor, Kupiec's POF, and TUFF statistics). Depending on the criterion chosen, the pattern and decision-making process vary. To illustrate effectiveness, we apply the proposed procedure to HI data sourced from the literature, covering both warning (linear degradation) and critical (exponential degradation) stages. While the method yields a binary output, there is potential for extension to a multi-class classification. Furthermore, experienced users can use the quality measure expressed in percentage for more in-depth analysis.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication Meets Heterogeneous Network: Emerging Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques enable users to extract, transmit, and reproduce information semantics via ML-based semantic communication (SemCom). This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. In the network, the semantic encoders and decoders among various users, based on ML, however, require collaborative updating according to new transmission tasks. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks in turn introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating. In this article, we first overview the key components of the SemCom system. We then discuss the unique challenges associated with semantic codec updates in heterogeneous networks. Accordingly, we point out a potential framework and discuss the pros and cons thereof. Finally, several future research directions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Joint Transceiver Design for RIS Enhanced Dual-Functional Radar-Communication with Movable Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have shown significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we investigate the MA-based transceiver design for DFRC systems, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance the communication quality in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors, receiving filter, antenna positions, and RIS reflecting coefficients. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop a fractional programming-based optimization framework, incorporating block coordinate descent (BCD), successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalty techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the radar SINR and achieve a satisfactory balance between the radar and communication performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Unifying View of OTFS and Its Many Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High mobility environment leads to severe Doppler effects and poses serious challenges to the conventional physical layer based on the widely popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The recent emergence of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, along with its many related variants, presents a promising solution to overcome such channel Doppler effects. This paper aims to clearly establish the relationships among the various manifestations of OTFS. Among these related modulations, we identify their connections, common features, and distinctions. Building on existing works, this work provides a general overview of various OTFS-related detection schemes and performance comparisons. We first provide an overview of OFDM and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) by demonstrating OTFS as a precoded FBMC through the introduction of inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT). We explore the relationship between OTFS and related modulation schemes with similar characteristics. We provide an effective channel model for high-mobility channels and offer a unified detection representation. We provide numerical comparisons of power spectrum density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) to underscore the benefit of these modulation schemes in high-mobility scenarios. We also evaluate various detection schemes, revealing insights into their efficacies. We discuss opportunities and challenges for OTFS in high mobility, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.</description>

Abstract: The increasing complexity of space systems, coupled with their critical operational roles, demands a robust, scalable, and sustainable security framework. This paper presents a novel system-of-systems approach for the upcoming Lunar Gateway. We demonstrate the application of the secure-by-component approach to the two earliest deployed systems in the Gateway, emphasizing critical security controls both internally and for external communication and connections. Additionally, we present a phased approach for the integration of Canadarm3, addressing the unique security challenges that arise from both inter-system interactions and the arm's autonomous capabilities.</description>

      <title>Array-Fed RIS: Validation of Friis-Based Modeling Using Full-Wave Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-fed large antenna arrays offer superior efficiency, simplicity, and reductions in size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) compared to constrained-feed systems. Historically, horn antennas have been used for space feeding, but they suffer from limitations such as bulky designs, low aperture efficiency ($\approx 50\%$), and restricted degrees of freedom at the continuous aperture. In contrast, planar patch arrays achieve significantly higher aperture efficiency ($&gt;90\%$) due to their more uniform aperture distribution, reduced weight, and increased degrees of freedom from the discretized aperture. Building on these advantages, we proposed an array-fed Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) system, where an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) optimizes power transfer by aligning with the principal eigenmode of the AMAF-RIS propagation matrix $\mathbf{T}$. While our previous studies relied on the Friis transmission formula for system modeling, we now validate this approach through full-wave simulations in CST Microwave Studio. By comparing the Friis-based matrix, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm Friis}$, with the full-wave solution, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm full.wave}$, we validate the relevance of the Friis-based modeling for top-level system design. Our findings confirm the feasibility of the proposed AMAF-RIS architecture for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for 6G: Prototypes, Experimental Results and Link/System level Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a powerful and versatile physical layer multiple access technique that generalizes and has better interference management capabilities than 5G-based Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). It is also a rapidly maturing technology, all of which makes it a natural successor to SDMA in 6G. In this article, we describe RSMA's suitability for 6G by presenting: i) link and system level simulations of RSMA's performance gains over SDMA in realistic environments, and (ii) pioneering experimental results that demonstrate RSMA's gains over SDMA for key use cases like enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBb), and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We also comment on the status of standardization activities for RSMA.</description>

      <title>Joint Attention Mechanism Learning to Facilitate Opto-physiological Monitoring during Physical Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring is a non-contact technique for measuring cardiac signals, i.e., photoplethysmography (PPG). Quality PPG signals directly lead to reliable physiological readings. However, PPG signal acquisition procedures are often accompanied by spurious motion artefacts (MAs), especially during low-to-high-intensity physical activity. This study proposes a practical adversarial learning approach for opto-physiological monitoring by using a generative adversarial network with an attention mechanism (AM-GAN) to model motion noise and to allow MA removal. The AM-GAN learns an MA-resistant mapping from raw and noisy signals to clear PPG signals in an adversarial manner, guided by an attention mechanism to directly translate the motion reference of triaxial acceleration to the MAs appearing in the raw signal. The AM-GAN was experimented with three various protocols engaged with 39 subjects in various physical activities. The average absolute error for heart rate (HR) derived from the MA-free PPG signal via the AM-GAN, is 1.81 beats/min for the IEEE-SPC dataset and 3.86 beats/min for the PPGDalia dataset. The same procedure applied to an in-house LU dataset resulted in average absolute errors for HR and respiratory rate (RR) of less than 1.37 beats/min and 2.49 breaths/min, respectively. The study demonstrates the robustness and resilience of AM-GAN, particularly during low-to-high-intensity physical activities.</description>

      <title>Uplink OFDM Channel Prediction with Hybrid CNN-LSTM for 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communications are typically subject to complex channel dynamics, requiring the transmission of pilot sequences to estimate and equalize such effects and correctly receive information bits. This is especially true in 6G non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) in low Earth orbit, where one end of the communication link orbits around the Earth at several kilometers per second, and a multi-carrier waveform, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is employed. To minimize the pilot overhead, we remove pilot symbols every other OFDM slot and propose a channel predictor to obtain the channel frequency response (CFR) matrix in absence of pilots. The algorithm employs an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory layer, along with skip connections, to predict the CFR matrix on the upcoming slot based on the current one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictor through numerical simulations in tapped delay line channel models, highlighting the effective throughput improvement. We further assess the generalization capabilities of the model, showing minimal throughput degradation when testing under different Doppler spreads and in both line of sight (LoS) and non-LoS propagation conditions. Finally, we discuss computational-complexity-related aspects of the lightweight hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture.</description>

      <title>ESPARGOS: An Ultra Low-Cost, Realtime-Capable Multi-Antenna WiFi Channel Sounder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-antenna channel sounding is a technique for measuring the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves that is commonly employed for parameterizing channel models. Channel sounders are usually custom-built from many Software Defined Radio receivers, making them expensive to procure and difficult to operate, which constrains the set of users to a few specialized scientific institutions and industrial research laboratories. Recent developments in Joint Communications and Sensing (JCaS) extend the possible uses of channel data to applications like human activity recognition, human presence detection, user localization and wireless Channel Charting, all of which are of great interest to security researchers, experts in industrial automation and others. However, due to a lack of affordable, easy-to-use and commercially available multi-antenna channel sounders, those scientific communities can be hindered by their lack of access to wireless channel measurements. To lower the barrier to entry for channel sounding, we develop an ultra low-cost measurement hardware platform based on mass-produced WiFi chips, which is easily affordable to research groups and even hobbyists.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose LIR-LIVO, a lightweight and robust LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry system designed for challenging illumination and degraded environments. The proposed method leverages deep learning-based illumination-resilient features and LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry (LIVO). By incorporating advanced techniques such as uniform depth distribution of features enabled by depth association with LiDAR point clouds and adaptive feature matching utilizing Superpoint and LightGlue, LIR-LIVO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and robustness with low computational cost. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including NTU-VIRAL, Hilti'22, and R3LIVE-Dataset. The corresponding results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other SOTA methods on both standard and challenging datasets. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates robust pose estimation under poor ambient lighting conditions in the Hilti'22 dataset.

      <title>Data Sensor Fusion In Digital Twin Technology For Enhanced Capabilities In A Home Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of data sensor fusion in digital twin technology to bolster home environment capabilities, particularly in the context of challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects. The study underscores the crucial role of digital transformation in not just adapting to, but also mitigating disruptions during the fourth industrial revolution. Using the Wit Motion sensor, data was collected for activities such as walking, working, sitting, and lying, with sensors measuring accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The research integrates Cyber-physical systems, IoT, AI, and robotics to fortify digital twin capabilities.
  The paper compares sensor fusion methods, including feature-level fusion, decision-level fusion, and Kalman filter fusion, alongside machine learning models like SVM, GBoost, and Random Forest to assess model effectiveness. Results show that sensor fusion significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of these models, as it compensates for individual sensor weaknesses, particularly with magnetometers. Despite higher accuracy in ideal conditions, integrating data from multiple sensors ensures more consistent and reliable results in real-world settings, thereby establishing a robust system that can be confidently applied in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum code division multiple access based continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum code division multiple access (q-CDMA) based continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system. In the proposed system, the quantum states of two senders ($\text{Alice}_{1,2}$) are chaotically encoded through chaotic phase shifters and then transmitted over a quantum channel. At the receiver, the quantum states are decoded via chaos synchronization to separate the quantum states sent by the different senders and received by the two receivers ($\text{Bob}_{1,2}$) separately. We characterize the input-output relation of the quadrature between the two senders and receivers and then analyze the secret key rate (SKR) of the q-CDMA-based CV-QKD system. Our numerical results reveal that the q-CDMA approach can significantly enhance the SKR for both users when compared to the single-user case without the q-CDMA approach.</description>

      <title>Learning to Predict Global Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics from Sparse Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) consists of a one-size-fits-all treatment with limited success in persistent AF. This may be due to our inability to map the dynamics of AF with the limited resolution and coverage provided by sequential contact mapping catheters, preventing effective patient phenotyping for personalised, targeted ablation. Here we introduce FibMap, a graph recurrent neural network model that reconstructs global AF dynamics from sparse measurements. Trained and validated on 51 non-contact whole atria recordings, FibMap reconstructs whole atria dynamics from 10% surface coverage, achieving a 210% lower mean absolute error and an order of magnitude higher performance in tracking phase singularities compared to baseline methods. Clinical utility of FibMap is demonstrated on real-world contact mapping recordings, achieving reconstruction fidelity comparable to non-contact mapping. FibMap's state-spaces and patient-specific parameters offer insights for electrophenotyping AF. Integrating FibMap into clinical practice could enable personalised AF care and improve outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.</description>

      <title>A novel and efficient parameter estimation of the Lognormal-Rician turbulence model based on k-Nearest Neighbor and data generation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient parameter estimator based on $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) and data generation method for the Lognormal-Rician turbulence channel. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit statistical tools are employed to investigate the validity of $k$NN approximation under different channel conditions and it is shown that the choice of $k$ plays a significant role in the approximation accuracy. We present several numerical results to illustrate that solving the constructed objective function can provide a reasonable estimate for the actual values. The accuracy of the proposed estimator is investigated in terms of the mean square error. The simulation results show that increasing the number of generation samples by two orders of magnitude does not lead to a significant improvement in estimation performance when solving the optimization problem by the gradient descent algorithm. However, the estimation performance under the genetic algorithm (GA) approximates to that of the saddlepoint approximation and expectation-maximization estimators. Therefore, combined with the GA, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the best tradeoff between the computation complexity and the accuracy.</description>

      <title>AI Flow at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.</description>

      <title>Resonant Beam Multi-Target DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for internet of things (IoT) applications, especially for location-based services, how to locate passive mobile targets (MTs) with minimal beam control has become a challenge. Resonant beam systems are considered promising IoT technologies with advantages such as beam self-alignment and energy concentration. To establish a resonant system in the radio frequency (RF) band and achieve multi-target localization, this paper designs a multi-target resonant system architecture, allowing a single base station (BS) to independently connect with multiple MTs. By employing a retro-directive array, a multi-channel cyclic model is established to realize one-to-many electromagnetic wave propagation and MT direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation through echo resonance. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports resonant establishment between the BS and multiple MTs. This helps the BS to still have high DOA estimation accuracy in the face of multiple passive MTs, and can ensure that the DOA error is less than 1 degree within a range of 6 meters at a 50degree field of view, with higher accuracy than active beamforming localization systems.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Array Enhanced Over-the-Air Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology for fast wireless data aggregation by harnessing the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) array-enhanced AirComp system, employing the new degrees of freedom achieved by antenna movements. Specifically, we jointly optimize the transceiver design and antenna position vector (APV) to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between target and estimated function values. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex problem, we adopt an alternating optimization technique to decompose it into three subproblems. These subproblems are then iteratively solved until convergence, leading to a locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that FA arrays with the proposed transceiver and APV design significantly outperform the traditional fixed-position antenna arrays in terms of MSE.</description>

      <title>Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively. The code is released at https://github.com/MyLearnCodeSpace/Adaptive-NAD.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Overview of AI and Communication for 6G Network: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14538v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.</description>

      <title>Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>
