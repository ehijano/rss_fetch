      <title>Tunneling spectra of unconventional quasi-two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid condensation can fundamentally be different from that predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. In a broad class of low-carrier-density superconductors, such as granular aluminum, doped nitrides, and high-Tc cuprates, tunneling experiments reveal strong rather than weak coupling, as well as a conductance that does not return to that of the normal state upon approaching the critical temperature Tc. Here, we show that this behavior is in quantitative agreement with a tunneling theory that takes into account the large pairing-fluctuation effects that occur in the crossover region from weak-coupling BCS to strong-coupling Bose-Einstein condensation, provided the coherence energy scale rather than the single-particle energy gap is used to evaluate the coupling ratio. We also propose that the tendency toward strong coupling is a generic property of quasi-2D low-carrier-density superconductors.</description>

      <title>A Counterdiabatic Route to Entanglement Steering and Dynamical Freezing in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is crucial for developing quantum technologies. This work demonstrates that counter-diabatic (CD) driving provides a powerful tool for steering collective spin systems along entangled trajectories for a long time. In particular, CD driving leads to approximate stroboscopic freezing and eternal entanglement oscillations for a large class of initial states in the periodically driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. This is accompanied by a decrease in the average eigenstate entanglement and inverse participation ratio, thereby signalling greater eigenstate localization. Our work opens a new route to evade Floquet heating and control entanglement generation in collective spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays today offer powerful platforms for studying strongly correlated phases of quantum matter. Here, we employ the projective symmetry group framework to describe the symmetry fractionalization patterns in a topologically ordered $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) synthesized in such a Rydberg array on the ruby lattice. By systematically comparing the static structure factors of $\textit{all}$ possible mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ against density-matrix renormalization group calculations, we identify a promising candidate for the precise $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ QSL realized microscopically. We also present detailed analyses of the dynamical structure factors as a reference for future experiments and showcase how these spin correlations can differentiate between varied QSL $\textit{Ans\"atze}$.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion algebraic mapping in second quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algebraic method to derive the structure at the basis of the mapping of bosonic algebras of creation and annihilation operators into fermionic algebras, and vice versa, introducing a suitable identification between bosonic and fermionic generators. The algebraic structure thus obtained corresponds to a deformed Grassmann algebra, involving anticommuting Grassmann-type variables. The role played by the latter in the implementation of gauge invariance in second quantization within our procedure is then discussed, together with the application of the mapping to the case of the bosonic and fermionic harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Temporal Bell inequalities in a many-body system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving the completeness of quantum mechanics has been a fundamental task since its foundation. After the formulation of the Bell inequalities, violated by quantum physics, it is nowadays believed that the theory is complete and non-local. While more general Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties choose at random two measurements to perform at causally-disconnected space-times, one could formulate temporal inequalities in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected parties, these extensions are compatible with local hidden-variable theories, so that no quantum nature appears in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. The chain constitutes a medium for the spreading of quantum information, which prevents the immediate signaling and thus the deterministic time evolution after the first measurement. Our result suggests that, as expected in a many-body setup, the Lieb-Robinson bound substitutes the speed of light as the fundamental limit for the spreading of information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multi-band BCS free energy functional and prove that for a multi-band superconductor the effect of inter-band coupling can only increase the critical temperature, irrespective of its attractive or repulsive nature and its strength. Further, for weak coupling and weaker inter-band coupling, we prove that the dependence of the increase in critical temperature on the inter-band coupling is (1) linear, if there are two or more equally strongly superconducting bands, or (2) quadratic, if there is only one dominating band.</description>

      <title>Observation of spin squeezing with contact interactions in one- and three-dimensional easy-plane magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in a many-particle system can enable measurement sensitivities beyond that achievable by only classical correlations. For an ensemble of spins, all-to-all interactions are known to reshape the quantum projection noise, leading to a form of entanglement known as spin squeezing. Here, we demonstrate spin squeezing with strictly short-range contact interactions. In particular, working with ultracold lithium atoms in optical lattices, we utilize superexchange interactions to realize a nearest-neighbor anisotropic Heisenberg model. We investigate the resulting quench dynamics from an initial product state in both one and three dimensions. In 1D, we observe $1.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$ dB of spin squeezing in quantitative agreement with theory. However, in 3D, we observe a maximum of $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$ dB of squeezing, over an order of magnitude smaller than that expected. We demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from the presence of a finite density of holes; both the motion of the holes as well as direct coupling between spin and density qualitatively alter the spin dynamics. Our observations point to the importance of understanding the complex interplay between motional and spin degrees of freedom in quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of density-density correlations in a 1D gas of hard-core particles initially prepared at equilibrium (either at zero or finite temperature) on a semi-infinite line and subsequently let to expand into the other (initially empty) half of the system. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Loop Algorithm for Quantum Transverse Ising Model in a Longitudinal Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transverse Ising model and its extensions play a critical role in various fields, such as statistical physics, quantum magnetism, quantum simulations, and mathematical physics. Although it does not suffer from the sign problem in most cases, the corresponding quantum Monte Carlo algorithm performs inefficiently, especially at a large longitudinal field. The main hindrance is the lack of loop update method which can strongly decrease the auto-correlation between Monte Carlo steps. Here, we successfully develop a loop algorithm with a novel merge-unmerge process. It demonstrates a great advantage over the state-of-the-art algorithm when implementing it to simulate the Rydberg atom chain and Kagome qubit ice. This advanced algorithm suits many systems such as Rydberg atom arrays, trapped ions, quantum materials, and quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>The Huang-Yang formula for the low-density Fermi gas: upper bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of spin $1/2$ fermions with repulsive short-range interactions. We derive an upper bound that agrees, at low density $\rho$, with the Huang-Yang conjecture. The latter captures the first three terms in an asymptotic low-density expansion, and in particular the Huang-Yang correction term of order $\rho^{7/3}$. Our trial state is constructed using an adaptation of the bosonic Bogoliubov theory to the Fermi system, where the correlation structure of fermionic particles is incorporated by quasi-bosonic Bogoliubov transformations. In the latter, it is important to consider a modified zero-energy scattering equation that takes into account the presence of the Fermi sea, in the spirit of the Bethe-Goldstone equation.</description>

      <title>Two-dopant origin of competing stripe and pair formation in Hubbard and $t$-$J$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models' phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$ Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling $t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and pair states on the two-dopant level.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a macro-coherent regime in exciton-polariton systems, where nonequilibrium polariton Bose--Einstein condensation coexists with macroscopically occupied vibrational states. Strong exciton-vibration coupling induces an effective optomechanical interaction between cavity polaritons and vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules, leading to vibrational amplification in a resonant blue-detuned configuration. This interaction provide a sympathetic mechanism to achieve vibrational condensation with potential applications in cavity-controlled chemistry, nonlinear and quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The functional renormalisation group (FRG) approach is employed to study Bose polarons at finite temperatures in the regime of strong attractive bath-impurity interactions. Both two- and three-dimensional configurations are considered. The appearance of two polaron quasiparticle branches at finite temperatures is revealed, consistent with recent findings by other analytical techniques. Ground-state polaron energies are also reported for selected interactions and temperatures within the gas superfluid phase. The findings of this work present the FRG as a useful tool for studying finite-temperature polarons in quantum gases.</description>

Abstract: We present a general driving protocol for many-body systems to generate a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries. This imprints emergent quasi-conservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$.</description>
