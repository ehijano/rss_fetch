      <title>Twisted Trilayer Graphene, Quasiperiodic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer moir\'e materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moir\'e scale due to the interference of different misaligned moir\'e periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.</description>

      <title>A scanning probe microscopy approach for identifying defects in aluminum oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.</description>

      <title>Effect of hybrid field coupling in nanostructured surfaces on anisotropic signal detection in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.</description>

      <title>Hf/Zr Superlattice-Based High-\k{appa} Gate Dielectrics with Dipole Layer Engineering for Advanced CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.</description>

      <title>Minimal d-Band Model for the Optical Susceptibility of Non-Centrosymmetric Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been customarily calculated ab initio using plane waves and without separating the most important orbitals contributions. In the family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, we take advantage of the mostly d-orbital content of the Bloch bands around the semiconductor gap to reduce the calculation of the linear and quadratic optical susceptibilities to a very minimal model. Such a simple approach reproduces well first principles calculations and could be the starting point for the inclusion of many-body effects and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in TMDCs with only a few energy bands in a numerically inexpensive way.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Transport and 1D Channel in a Graphene Nanoslide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of the graphene nanoslide, a fundamental device for graphene straintronics that realizes a single pseudogauge barrier. We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.</description>

      <title>Effects of electron-electron interaction and spin-orbit coupling on Andreev pair qubits in quantum dot Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2\Delta$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.</description>

      <title>Efficient population transfer in a quantum dot exciton under phonon-induced decoherence via shortcuts to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.</description>

      <title>Various electronic crystal phases in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the emergence of electronic crystal phases in rhombohedral multilayer graphene using comprehensive self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations combined with \textit{ab initio} tight binding model. As the carrier density increases, we uncover an isospin cascade sequence of phase transitions that gives rise to a rich variety of ordered states, including electronic crystal phases with non-zero Chern numbers. We further show the nearly degeneracy of these topological electronic crystals hosting extended quantum anomalous Hall effect (EQAH) in the mean field regime and characterize pressure driven phase transitions. Finally, we discuss the thermodynamic signatures, particularly the behavior of the inverse compressibility, in light of recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Electronic Crystals in Bilayer Graphene--Mott Insulator Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.</description>

      <title>Observation of robust one-dimensional edge channels in a three-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $\alpha$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale spin sensing of a 2D $d$-wave altermagnet via helical tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Novel qubits in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.</description>

      <title>Soliton formation in a bound state in the continuum GaN waveguide polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Ferromagnetic Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Terahertz switching of antiferromagnetic order by N\'eel spin-orbit torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by N\'eel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the N\'eel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90{\deg} at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast N\'eel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Reversible Excitonic Charge State Conversion and High Quasiparticle Densities in PVA-doped Monolayer WS$_2$ on 2D Microsphere Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Emergent ac Effect in Nonreciprocal Coupled Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.</description>

Abstract: This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</description>

      <title>Interface Modeling of Perovskite Polymer Heterostructures for Enhanced Charge Transfer Efficiency in Hybrid Photovoltaic Materials</title>

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.</description>

      <title>Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir &gt; U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Superconductor Shift Registers with Energy Dissipation Below Landauer's Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Computational Bottlenecks in Quantum Hydrodynamics: A Volume-Based Integral Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscopic models of the optical response of metals have emerged as fundamental building blocks in quantum plasmonics, in principle overcoming the computational bottlenecks of ab initio techniques by implementing aspects of the atomistic description of the metal in otherwise classical calculations. Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale determination of the metal-insulator transition in intercalated bulk VSe$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder.</description>

      <title>Spin-galvanic response to non-equilibrium spin injection in superconductors with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even for spin voltages below the superconducting gap. Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify quantum geometric bounds for observables in non-Hermitian systems. We find unique bounds on non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensors, generalized two-point response correlators, conductivity tensors, and optical weights. We showcase these findings in topological systems with non-Hermitian Chern numbers. We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian geometric constraints on response functions naturally arise in open quantum systems governed by out-of-equilibrium Lindbladian dynamics. Our findings are relevant to experimental observables and responses under the realistic setups that fall beyond the idealized closed-system descriptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Shot noise signatures identifying non-Abelian properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. it remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.</description>

      <title>Coherent Absorption Synergizes with Plasmon-Enhanced Graphene Terahertz Photo-thermoelectric Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 microseconds. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Evolution towards quasi-equilibrium in nematic liquid crystals studied through decoherence of multi-spin multiple-quantum coherences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.01558v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New evidence is presented in favor of irreversible decoherence as the mechanism which leads an initial out-of-equilibrium state to quasi-equilibrium in nematic liquid crystals. The NMR experiment combines the Jeener-Broekaert sequence with reversal of the dipolar evolution and decoding of multiple-quantum coherences to allow visualizing the evolution of the multi-spin coherence spectra during the formation of the quasi-equilibrium states. We vary the reversion strategies and the preparation of initial states and observe that the spectra amplitude attenuate with the reversion time, and notably, that the decay is frequency selective. We interpret this effect as evidence of "eigen-selection", a signature of the occurrence of irreversible adiabatic decoherence, which indicates that the spin system in liquid crystal NMR experiments conforms an actual open quantum system.</description>

Abstract: Discovery of electron hydrodynamics in graphene system has opened a new scope of analytic calculations in condensed matter physics, which was traditionally well cultivated in science and engineering as a non-relativistic hydrodynamics and in high energy nuclear and astro physics as relativistic hydrodynamics. Electrons in graphene follow neither non-relativistic nor relativistic hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid domain of graphene system.</description>

Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a global one-form ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\eta$-pairing theory and anomalous localization in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing the eta-pairing theory to non-Hermitian Hubbard models on arbitrary lattices, we obtain the sufficient and necessary condition for the eta-pairing operator to be an eigenoperator of the Hamiltonian $H$, and find unique eta-pairing phenomena without Hermitian analogs. For instance, the Hermitian conjugate of an eta-pairing eigenoperator may not be an eigenoperator, eta-pairing eigenoperators can be spatially modulated, and the $SU(2)$ pseudospin symmetry may not be possible even if $H$ commutes with the eta-pairing operators. Remarkably, these novel non-Hermitian phenomena are closely related to each other by several theorems we establish and can lead to, for example, new types of eta-pairing operators (e.g., the notion of non-Hermitian angular-momentum operators) and the anomalous localization (e.g., the skin effect) of eta-pairing eigenstates. Some issues on the $SO(4)$ and particle-hole symmetries are clarified. Our general eta-pairing theory also reveals a previously unnoticed unification of these symmetries of the Hubbard model. To exemplify these findings, we first propose the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model. In this interacting non-Hermitian system without even the bulk translation invariance, the right and left two-particle eta-pairing eigenstates are exponentially localized at opposite boundaries of the chain. Then, we generalize this model to two dimensions and find that the eta-pairing eigenstates can exhibit the first- or second-order skin effect. Finally, a general two-sublattice model is constructed to realize all of the non-Hermitian eta-pairing phenomena. This work provides a new and rigorous theoretical framework for studying novel physical phenomena (e.g., the skin effect) in interacting non-Hermitian systems, even in arbitrary spatial dimensions and without the bulk translation symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modeled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>
