      <title>Immersions of complexes of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a complex of groups, we construct a new class of complex of groups that records its local data and offer a functorial perspective on the statement that complexes of groups are locally developable. We also construct a new notion of an immersion of complexes of groups and establish that a locally isometric immersion of a complex of groups into a non-positively curved complex of groups is $\pi_1$-injective. Furthermore, the domain complex of groups is developable and the induced map on geometric realizations of developments is an isometric embedding.</description>

      <title>Virtual fibring of manifolds and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topic of this survey is the phenomenon of fibring over the circle for manifolds, and its group-theoretic twin, algebraic fibring. We will discuss the state of the art, and explain briefly some of the ideas behind the more recent developments, focusing on RFRS groups and manifolds with such fundamental groups. Then we will move on to a more speculative part, where many conjectures about fibring in higher dimensions will be given. The conjectures vary in their level of plausibility, but even the boldest of them might share the fate of Thurston's Virtually Fibred Conjecture, about which Thurston famously said: ``This dubious-sounding question seems to have a definite chance for a positive answer''.</description>

      <title>Infinitely presented simple groups separated by homological finiteness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated linear group $G$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we construct a simple group $\Gamma$ that has the same finiteness properties as $G$ and admits $G$ as a quasi-retract. As an application, we construct a simple group of type $\mathrm{FP}_{\infty}$ that is not finitely presented. Moreover we show that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ there is a simple group of type $\mathrm{FP}_n$ that is neither finitely presented nor of type $\mathrm{FP}_{n+1}$. Since our simple groups arise as R\"over--Nekrashevych groups, this answers a question of Zaremsky.</description>

      <title>Coefficient systems on the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a conjecture (referred to as sur in the literature) in the representation theory of a reductive p-adic Lie group G which has important implications for the relationship between mod-p smooth representations and pro-p Iwahori-Hecke modules, and is currently only known for G of rank 1. We prove that sur follows from exactness of the associated oriented chain complex of a coefficient system, when restricted to a local region of the Bruhat-Tits building for G. Our main result gives strong evidence towards this exactness in the case where G=SL_3(K) for K a totally ramified extension of Q_p. We also develop new combinatorial techniques for analysing the geometric realisation of the A_2 Bruhat-Tits building, which are fundamental to the proof of our main result, and which we hope will inspire further investigation in Bruhat-Tits theory.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita equivalences and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</description>

      <title>Reducing the conjugacy problem for relatively hyperbolic automorphisms to peripheral components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a reduction of the conjugacy problem among outer automorphisms of free (and torsion-free hyperbolic) groups to specific algorithmic problems pertaining to mapping tori of polynomially growing automorphisms. We explain how to use this reduction and solve the conjugacy problem for several new classes of outer automorphisms. This proposes a path toward a full solution to the conjugacy problem for $Out (F_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote the symmetric group of degree $n$ by $S_n$. Let $\rho$ be an irreducible representation of $S_n$ over the field of complex numbers and $\sigma\in S_n$. In this paper, we describe the set of eigenvalues of $\rho(\sigma)$. Based on this result, we also obtain a description in the case of alternating groups.</description>

      <title>A continuum of non-isomorphic 3-generator groups with probabilistic law $x^n=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a continuum family of non-isomorphic 3-generator groups in which the identity $x^n = 1$ holds with probability 1, while failing to hold universally in each group. This resolves a recent question about the relationship between probabilistic and universal satisfaction of group identities. Our construction uses $n$-periodic products of cyclic groups of order $n$ and two-generator relatively free groups satisfying identities of the form $[x^{pn}, y^{pn}]^n = 1$. We prove that in each of these products, the probability of satisfying $x^n = 1$ is equal to 1, despite the fact that the identity does not hold throughout any of these groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we describe recent progress on asymptotic properties of various automorphic orbits in free groups. In particular, we address the problem of counting potentially positive elements of a given length. We also discuss complexity (worst-case, average-case, and generic-case) of Whitehead's automorphism problem and relevant properties of automorphic orbits, including orbit-blocking words.</description>

      <title>Simple solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study simple set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation that are finite and non-degenerate. Such retractable solutions are fully described and to investigate the irretracble solutions we give a new algebraic method. Our approach includes and extends the work of Joyce for quandles and Castelli for involutive solutions, demonstrating that the simplicity of a solution can be understood through its associated permutation skew left brace. In particular, we show that this skew left brace must have the smallest non-zero ideal, and the quotient by this ideal gives a trivial skew left brace of cyclic type; clearly all simple skew left braces satisfy these assumptions. As an application of our approach we construct and characterise new infinite families of simple solutions that are neither involutive nor quandles. Additionally, we show that our method can be applied to simple skew left braces to generate further families of simple solutions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Constructions for the Digraph Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency of routing on a regular digraph often involves finding opitmal properties of the graph. For example, the diameter of a digraph is the maximum distance between any two vertices. We show how we can study these problems algebraically in terms of quasigroups, 1-factors, and permutation groups. Our investigation originated from the study of graphs as the Cayley graphs of groupoids with $d$ generators, a left identity, and right cancellation; that is, a right quasigroup. This enables us to provide compact algebraic definitions for some important graphs that are either given as explicit edge lists or as the Cayley coset graphs of groups larger than the graph. One such example is a single expression for the Hoffman-Singleton graph. From there, we notice that the groupoids can be represented uniquely by a set of disjoint permutations and we explore the consequences of that observation.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Technique for the Wedderburn Decomposition of Rational Group Algebras of Nested GVZ $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a combinatorial formula for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups, where $p$ is an odd prime. Using this formula, we derive an explicit combinatorial expression for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of all two-generator $p$-groups of class $2$. Additionally, we provide explicit combinatorial formulas for the Wedderburn decomposition of rational group algebras of certain families of nested GVZ $p$-groups with arbitrarily large nilpotency class. We also classify all nested GVZ $p$-groups of order at most $p^5$ and compute the Wedderburn decomposition of their rational group algebras. Finally, we determine a complete set of primitive central idempotents for the rational group algebras of nested GVZ $p$-groups.</description>
