      <title>Resource Optimized Quantum Squaring Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum squaring operation is a useful building block in implementing quantum algorithms such as linear regression, regularized least squares algorithm, order-finding algorithm, quantum search algorithm, Newton Raphson division, Euclidean distance calculation, cryptography, and in finding roots and reciprocals. Quantum circuits could be made fault-tolerant by using error correcting codes and fault-tolerant quantum gates (such as the Clifford + T-gates). However, the T-gate is very costly to implement. Two qubit gates (such as the CNOT-gate) are more prone to noise errors than single qubit gates. Consequently, in order to realize reliable quantum algorithms, the quantum circuits should have a low T-count and CNOT-count. In this paper, we present a novel quantum integer squaring architecture optimized for T-count, CNOT-count, T-depth, CNOT-depth, and $KQ_T$ that produces no garbage outputs. To reduce costs, we use a novel approach for arranging the generated partial products that allows us to reduce the number of adders by 50%. We also use the resource efficient logical-AND gate and uncomputation gate shown in [1] to further save resources. The proposed quantum squaring circuit sees an asymptotic reduction of 66.67% in T-count, 50% in T-depth, 29.41% in CNOT-count, 42.86% in CNOT-depth, and 25% in KQ T with respect to Thapliyal et al. [2]. With respect to Nagamani et al. [3] the design sees an asymptotic reduction of 77.27% in T-count, 68.75% in T-depth, 50% in CNOT-count, 61.90% in CNOT-depth, and 6.25% in the $KQ_T$.</description>

      <title>HoneyGPT: Breaking the Trilemma in Terminal Honeypots with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Honeypots, as a strategic cyber-deception mechanism designed to emulate authentic interactions and bait unauthorized entities, continue to struggle with balancing flexibility, interaction depth, and deceptive capability despite their evolution over decades. Often they also lack the capability of proactively adapting to an attacker's evolving tactics, which restricts the depth of engagement and subsequent information gathering. Under this context, the emergent capabilities of large language models, in tandem with pioneering prompt-based engineering techniques, offer a transformative shift in the design and deployment of honeypot technologies. In this paper, we introduce HoneyGPT, a pioneering honeypot architecture based on ChatGPT, heralding a new era of intelligent honeypot solutions characterized by their cost-effectiveness, high adaptability, and enhanced interactivity, coupled with a predisposition for proactive attacker engagement. Furthermore, we present a structured prompt engineering framework that augments long-term interaction memory and robust security analytics. This framework, integrating thought of chain tactics attuned to honeypot contexts, enhances interactivity and deception, deepens security analytics, and ensures sustained engagement.
  The evaluation of HoneyGPT includes two parts: a baseline comparison based on a collected dataset and a field evaluation in real scenarios for four weeks. The baseline comparison demonstrates HoneyGPT's remarkable ability to strike a balance among flexibility, interaction depth, and deceptive capability. The field evaluation further validates HoneyGPT's efficacy, showing its marked superiority in enticing attackers into more profound interactive engagements and capturing a wider array of novel attack vectors in comparison to existing honeypot technologies.</description>

      <title>A Novel Paradigm Shift for Next-Generation: Symbiotic Backscatter Rate-Splitting Multiple Access Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are projected to empower a broad range of Internet-of-things (IoT) applications and services with extreme data rates, posing new challenges in delivering large-scale connectivity at a low cost to current communication paradigms. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is one of the most spotlight nominees, conceived to address spectrum scarcity while reaching massive connectivity. Meanwhile, symbiotic communication is said to be an inexpensive way to realize future IoT on a large scale. To reach the goal of spectrum efficiency improvement and low energy consumption, we merge these advances by means of introducing a novel paradigm shift, called symbiotic backscatter RSMA, for the next generation. Specifically, we first establish the way to operate the symbiotic system to assist the readers in apprehending the proposed paradigm, then guide detailed design in beamforming weights with four potential gain-control (GC) strategies for enhancing symbiotic communication, and finally provide an information-theoretic framework using a new metric, called symbiotic outage probability (SOP) to characterize the proposed system performance. Through numerical result experiments, we show that the developed framework can accurately predict the actual SOP and the efficacy of the proposed GC strategies in improving the SOP performance.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Variational Quantum Algorithms with Shifted Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given their potential to demonstrate near-term quantum advantage, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been extensively studied. Although numerous techniques have been developed for VQA parameter optimization, it remains a significant challenge. A practical issue is that quantum noise is highly unstable and thus it is likely to shift in real time. This presents a critical problem as an optimized VQA ansatz may not perform effectively under a different noise environment. For the first time, we explore how to optimize VQA parameters to be robust against unknown shifted noise. We model the noise level as a random variable with an unknown probability density function (PDF), and we assume that the PDF may shift within an uncertainty set. This assumption guides us to formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem, with the goal of finding parameters that maintain effectiveness under shifted noise. We utilize a distributionally robust Bayesian optimization solver for our proposed formulation. This provides numerical evidence in both the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with hardware-efficient ansatz, indicating that we can identify parameters that perform more robustly under shifted noise. We regard this work as the first step towards improving the reliability of VQAs influenced by shifted noise from the parameter optimization perspective.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg machines with programmable spin-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that we can harness two recent experimental developments to build a compact hardware emulator for the classical Heisenberg model in statistical physics. The first is the demonstration of spin-diffusion lengths in excess of microns in graphene even at room temperature. The second is the demonstration of low barrier magnets (LBMs) whose magnetization can fluctuate rapidly even at sub-nanosecond rates. Using experimentally benchmarked circuit models, we show that an array of LBMs driven by an external current source has a steady-state distribution corresponding to a classical system with an energy function of the form $E = -1/2\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} (\hat{m}_i \cdot \hat{m}_j$). This may seem surprising for a non-equilibrium system but we show that it can be justified by a Lyapunov function corresponding to a system of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations. The Lyapunov function we construct describes LBMs interacting through the spin currents they inject into the spin neutral substrate. We suggest ways to tune the coupling coefficients $J_{ij}$ so that it can be used as a hardware solver for optimization problems involving continuous variables represented by vector magnetizations, similar to the role of the Ising model in solving optimization problems with binary variables. Finally, we train a Heisenberg XOR gate based on a network of four coupled stochastic LLG equations, illustrating the concept of probabilistic computing with a programmable Heisenberg model.</description>
