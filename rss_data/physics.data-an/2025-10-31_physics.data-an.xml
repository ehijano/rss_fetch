      <title>Generative sampling with physics-informed kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generative network for Monte-Carlo sampling in lattice field theories and beyond, for which the learning of layerwise propagation is done and optimised independently on each layer. The architecture uses physics-informed renormalisation group flows that provide access to the layerwise propagation step from one layer to the next in terms of a simple first order partial differential equation for the respective renormalisation group kernel through a given layer. Thus, it transforms the generative task into that of solving once the set of independent and linear differential equations for the kernels of the transformation. As these equations are analytically known, the kernels can be refined iteratively. This allows us to structurally tackle out-of-domain problems generally encountered in generative models and opens the path to further optimisation. We illustrate the practical feasibility of the architecture within simulations in scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Brightify: A tool for calculating directionally-resolved brightness in neutron sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brightness is a critical metric for optimizing the design of neutron sources and beamlines, yet there is no direct way to calculate brightness within most Monte Carlo packages used for neutron source simulation. In this paper, we present Brightify, an open-source Python-based tool designed to calculate brightness from Monte Carlo Particle List (MCPL) files, which can be extracted from several Monte Carlo simulation packages. Brightify provides an efficient computational approach to calculate brightness for any particle type and energy spectrum recorded in the MCPL file. It enables localized, directionally-resolved brightness evaluations by scanning across both spatial and angular domains, facilitating the identification of positions and directions corresponding to maximum brightness. This functionality is particularly valuable for identifying brightness hotspots and helping fine-tune the design of neutron sources for optimal performance. We validate Brightify against standard methods, such as surface current tally and point estimator tally, and demonstrate its accuracy and adaptability, particularly in high-resolution analyses. By overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, Brightify streamlines neutron source re-optimization, reduces computational burden, and accelerates source development workflows. The full code is available on the Brightify GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Light-scattering reconstruction of transparent shapes using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the 3D deformations of slender fibres and thin sheets in flow, is a key experimental challenge in the study of particle-laden flows. We propose a high-resolution, single-camera method to visualise non-intrusively the shape of a transparent crumpled sheet, as it translates, rotates and deforms. We perform periodic scans of the crumpled shape by illuminating it with a sequence of stacked light sheets at a rate much faster than its deformation and image the scattered light signal in a plane near-orthogonal to the plane of lighting. Processing of the data using a pinhole camera model yields a noisy spatio-temporal dataset of the strongly deformed time-evolving surface of the sheet, which we reconstruct in 3D using a neural autoencoder. We validate the robustness of the shape reconstruction algorithm to noise using synthetic data sets, and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of laboratory sedimentation experiments with elastic disks. We find that the inclusion of isometricity-enforcing penalties into the cost function of the autoencoder enables us to robustly reconstruct highly folded shapes, where different regions of the sheet overlap.</description>

      <title>A Simple Method for More Precise Pulse-Height Fitting in Sparsely Sampled Data Using Pulse-Shape-Archetype Information, Especially Suited to Ultra-Short-Laser Pulsetrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel pulse-reconstruction method well suited to sparsely sampled repetitive data, such as commonly arise from trains of ultrashort laser-pulses. Typically waveforms in such traces are fully instrument-limited by the detecting systems, for instance, the combination of detector and oscilloscope, and only the energy of each waveform is sought. The method applies whenever shape of the waveform is the same for every pulse and can be well-characterized, with only amplitude and relative peak-timing changing. Under such conditions this information, known in advance, can be used as a basis - an archetype - for very accurate pulse fitting. Our characterizations show that the method very accurately extracts pulse heights and relative pulse timing, even when sampling routinely misses the pulse peak, and entirely misses the rising or falling edge. We show this method to be adaptable in different detection systems, showing significant improvement in accuracy of measurement, in this class of problem.</description>
