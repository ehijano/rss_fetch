      <title>Locomotion on a lubricating fluid with spatial viscosity variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied locomotion of a crawler on a thin Newtonian fluid film whose viscosity varied spatially. We first derived a general locomotion velocity formula with fluid viscosity variations via the lubrication theory. For further analysis, the surface of the crawler was described by a combination of transverse and longitudinal travelling waves and we analysed the time-averaged locomotion behaviours under two scenarios: (i) a sharp viscosity interface and (ii) a linear viscosity gradient. Using the asymptotic expansions of small surface deformations and the method of multiple time-scale analysis, we derived an explicit form of the average velocity that captures nonlinear, accumulative interactions between the crawler and the spatially varying environment. (i) In the case of a viscosity interface, the time-averaged speed of the crawler is always slower than that in the uniform viscosity, for both the transverse and longitudinal wave cases. Notably, the speed reduction is most significant when the crawler's front enters a more viscous layer and the crawler's rear exits from the same layer. (ii) In the case of a viscosity gradient, the crawler's speed becomes slower for the transverse wave, while for the longitudinal wave, the corrections are of a higher order compared with the uniform viscosity case. As an application of the derived locomotion velocity formula, we also analysed the impacts of a substrate topography to the average speed. Our analysis illustrates the fundamental importance of interactions between a locomotor and its environment, and separating the time scale behind the locomotion.</description>

      <title>Effect of three-orifice baffles orientation on the flow and thermal-hydraulic performance: experimental analysis for net and oscillatory flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-orifice baffles equally spaced along a circular tube are investigated as a means for heat transfer enhancement under net, oscillatory and compound flows. An unprecedented, systematic analysis of the relative orientation of consecutive baffles -- aligned or opposed -- is accomplished to assess the changes induced on the flow structure and their impact on the thermal-hydraulic performance. The results cover the Nusselt number, the net and oscillatory friction factors and the instantaneous velocity fields using PIV in an experimental campaign with a 32 mm tube diameter. The study is conducted in the range of net Reynolds numbers $50 &lt; Re_n &lt; 1000$ and oscillatory Reynolds numbers $0 &lt; Re_{osc}&lt; 750$, for a dimensionless amplitude $x_0/D = 0.5$ and $Pr=65$. In absence of oscillatory flow, opposed baffles advance the transition to turbulence from $Re_n = 100$ to $50$, increasing the net friction factor (40 %) for $Re_n &gt; 50$ and the Nusselt number (maximum of 27 %) for $Re_n &lt; 150$. When an oscillatory flow is applied, augmentations caused by opposed baffles are only observed for $Re_n &lt; 150$ and $Re_{osc} &lt; 150$. Above $Re_n$, $Re_{osc}&gt;150$, opposed baffles are not recommended for the promotion of heat transfer, owing to friction penalties. However, the chaotic mixing and lack of short-circuiting between baffles observed with flow velocimetry over a wide range of operational conditions point out the interest of this configuration to achieve plug flow.</description>

      <title>From annular cavity to rotor-stator flow: nonlinear dynamics of axisymmetric rolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporally complex flows are found at the onset of unsteadiness in (axisymmetric) rotor-stator turbulence in the shape of concentric rolls. The emergence of these rolls is rationalised using a homotopy approach, where the original flow configuration is continuously deformed into a simpler, better understood configuration. We deform here rotor-stator flow into an annular flow, thereby controlling curvature effects, and we investigate numerically the transition scenarios as functions of the Reynolds number. Increasing curvature starting from the planar limit reveals a clear path towards a subcritical scenario as a function of the Reynolds number. As the rotor-stator configuration is approached, supercritical branches shift to increasing Reynolds number while a subcritical branch of chaotic states takes over. Modal selection in the supercritical scenario involves the competition between two modal families. It rests on a specific radial localisation property of all eigenmodes, linked to the space-dependent convective radial velocity which intensifies as curvature is increased. A new nonlinear mechanism for the pairing of rolls is proposed based on multiple resonances. The critical point where the original rotor-stator flow loses its stability to axisymmetric perturbations is identified for the first time for the geometry under study.</description>

      <title>What determines the breakup length of a jet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakup of a capillary jet into drops is believed to be governed by initial disturbances on the surface of the jet that grow exponentially. The disturbances are often assumed to be due to external sources of noise, to turbulence, or to imperfections of the nozzle. However, even in conditions where external perturbations are minimal, the jet's length cannot grow indefinitely, suggesting that its fragmentation cannot be entirely attributed to such factors. Here we show that the initial disturbances are thermal capillary waves. By extrapolating the observed growth of the instability back in time, we demonstrate that the initiating disturbances must be of the order of an {\aa}ngstr\"om, consistent with fluctuations induced by thermal noise. Further, by performing many experiments with different nozzles, we find no significant variation in breakup length linked to nozzle type, shape or inner roughness. By systematically varying the jet diameter and velocity, and the surface tension, viscosity, and density of the fluid, we validate our thermal disturbance model over four orders of magnitude in jet length; seven orders of magnitude if simulations of nanojets are included.</description>

      <title>Active Flow Control for Bluff Body under High Reynolds Number Turbulent Flow Conditions Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for active flow control in a turbulent flow field of high Reynolds numbers at $Re=274000$. That is, an agent is trained to obtain a control strategy that can reduce the drag of a cylinder while also minimizing the oscillations of the lift. Probes are placed only around the surface of the cylinder, and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent controls nine zero-net mass flux jets on the downstream side of the cylinder. The trained PPO agent effectively reduces drag by $29\%$ and decreases lift oscillations by $18\%$ of amplitude, with the control effect demonstrating good repeatability. Control tests of this agent within the Reynolds number range of $Re=260000$ to $288000$ show the agent's control strategy possesses a certain degree of robustness, with very similar drag reduction effects under different Reynolds numbers. Analysis using power spectral energy reveals that the agent learns specific flow frequencies in the flow field and effectively suppresses low-frequency, large-scale structures. Graphically visualizing the policy, combined with pressure, vorticity, and turbulent kinetic energy contours, reveals the mechanism by which jets achieve drag reduction by influencing reattachment vortices. This study successfully implements robust active flow control in realistically significant high Reynolds number turbulent flows, minimizing time costs (using two-dimensional geometrical models and turbulence models) and maximally considering the feasibility of future experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Self-Propulsion of floating ice blocks caused by melting in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that floating ice blocks with asymmetric shapes can self-propel with significant speeds due to buoyancy driven currents caused by the melting ice. Model right-angle ice wedges are found to move in the direction opposite to the gravity current which descends along the longest inclined side in water, with temperatures above 4{\deg}C. We describe the measured speed as a function of the length and angle of the inclined side, and the temperature of the bath in terms of a propulsion model which incorporates the cooling of the surrounding fluid by the melting ice. We show the heat pulled from the surrounding liquid by the melting ice block leads to net propulsion which is balanced by drag. We further show that the ice block moves robustly in a salt water bath with salinity similar to that of the ocean, in the same direction as in fresh water, implying that this propulsion mechanism may be relevant to icebergs in sufficiently warm oceans.</description>

      <title>Local Divergence-Free Immersed Finite Element-Difference Method Using Composite B-Splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the class of immersed boundary (IB) methods, the choice of the delta function plays a crucial role in transferring information between fluid and solid domains. Most prior work has used isotropic kernels that do not preserve the divergence-free condition of the velocity field, leading to loss of incompressibility of the solid when interpolating velocity to Lagrangian markers. To address this issue, in simulations involving large deformations of incompressible hyperelastic structures immersed in fluid, researchers often use stabilization approaches such as adding a volumetric energy term. Composite B-spline (CBS) kernels offer an alternative by maintaining the discrete divergence-free property. This work evaluates CBS kernels in terms of volume conservation and accuracy, comparing them with isotropic kernel functions using a construction introduced by Peskin (IB kernels) and B-spline (BS) kernels. Benchmark tests include pressure-loaded and shear-dominated flows, such as an elastic band under pressure loads, a pressurized membrane, a compressed block, Cook's membrane, and a slanted channel flow. Additionally, we validate our methodology using a complex fluid-structure interaction model of bioprosthetic heart valve dynamics. Results demonstrate that CBS kernels achieve superior volume conservation compared to isotropic kernels, eliminating the need for stabilization techniques. Further, CBS kernels converge on coarser fluid grids, while IB and BS kernels need finer grids for comparable accuracy. Unlike IB and BS kernels, which perform better with larger mesh ratios, CBS kernels improve with smaller mesh ratios. Wider kernels provide more accurate results across all methods, but CBS kernels are less sensitive to grid spacing variations than isotropic kernels.</description>

      <title>Scalable resolvent analysis for three-dimensional flows</title>

Abstract: Resolvent analysis is a powerful tool for studying coherent structures in turbulent flows. However, its application beyond canonical flows with symmetries that can be used to simplify the problem to inherently three-dimensional flows and other large systems has been hindered by the computational cost of computing resolvent modes. In particular, the CPU and memory requirements of state-of-the-art algorithms scale poorly with the problem dimension, \ie the number of discrete degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present RSVD-$\Delta t$, a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by combining randomized singular value decomposition with an optimized time-stepping method for computing the action of the resolvent operator. Critically, the CPU cost and memory requirements of the algorithm scale linearly with the problem dimension. We develop additional strategies to minimize these costs and control errors. We validate the algorithm using a Ginzburg-Landau test problem and demonstrate RSVD-$\Delta t$'s low cost and improved scaling using a three-dimensional discretization of a turbulent jet. Lastly, we use it to study the impact of low-speed streaks on the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepackets in the jet via secondary stability analysis, a problem that would have been intractable using previous algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient harmonic resolvent analysis via time-stepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the RSVD-$\Delta t$ algorithm initially developed for resolvent analysis of statistically stationary flows to handle harmonic resolvent analysis of time-periodic flows. The harmonic resolvent operator, as proposed by \citet{Padovanetal20}, characterizes the linearized dynamics of time-periodic flows in the frequency domain, and its singular value decomposition reveals forcing and response modes with optimal energetic gain. However, computing harmonic resolvent modes poses challenges due to $(i)$ the coupling of all $N_{\omega}$ retained frequencies into a single harmonic resolvent operator and $(ii)$ the singularity or near-singularity of the operator, making harmonic resolvent analysis considerably more computationally expensive than a standard resolvent analysis. To overcome these challenges, the RSVD-$\Delta t$ algorithm leverages time stepping of the underlying time-periodic linearized Navier-Stokes operator, which is $N_{\omega}$ times smaller than the harmonic resolvent operator, to compute the action of the harmonic resolvent operator. We develop strategies to minimize the algorithm's CPU and memory consumption, and our results demonstrate that these costs scale linearly with the problem dimension. We validate the RSVD-$\Delta t$ algorithm by computing modes for a periodically varying Ginzburg-Landau equation and demonstrate its performance using the flow over an airfoil.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in a stably stratified, valley-shaped enclosure heated from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe the spontaneous onset of three-dimensional motion from a quiescent, purely conductive state of a stably stratified fluid in a V-shaped enclosure heated from below, which ultimately self-organizes into a two-dimensional steady state without any external forcing to the initial configuration. We identify a dominant three-dimensional instability through modal stability analysis. Direct numerical simulations confirm this instability but also reveal that, after an initial period of spontaneous three-dimensional growth, the flow gradually self-organizes into a steady two-dimensional state without external intervention. This self-organization manifests consistently for any arbitrary infinitesimal three-dimensional disturbance to the initial quiescent configuration. We demonstrate that the mechanism driving this self-organization is the increasing dominance of viscous dissipation over buoyant production of disturbance kinetic energy at later stages of flow evolution from the initial quiescent state. Our investigation reveals a flow scenario in which the most natural transition pathway to the final state involves passing through an intermediate state with a higher dimension than the final state itself. Specifically, our final flow state is less complex than the three-dimensional most unstable eigenvector predicted by linear stability analysis. We demonstrate that the entire flow evolution remains non-turbulent throughout and closely aligns with results from linear stability analysis, distinguishing the present flow dynamics from transient chaos, which also features complex transient states that eventually converge to a less complex final state.</description>

      <title>Measurements and modelling of induced flow in collective vertical migration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions between swimming or flying organisms can lead to complex flows on the scale of the group. These emergent fluid dynamics are often more complex than a linear superposition of individual organism flows, especially at intermediate Reynolds numbers. This paper presents an approach to estimate the flow induced by multiple swimmer wakes in proximity using a semianalytical model that conserves mass and momentum in the aggregation. The key equations are derived analytically, while the implementation and solution of these equations are carried out numerically. This model was informed by and compared with empirical measurements of induced vertical migrations of brine shrimp, Artemia salina. The response of individual swimmers to ambient background flow and light intensity was evaluated. In addition, the time-resolved three-dimensional spatial configuration of the swimmers was measured using a recently developed laser scanning system. Numerical results using the model found that the induced flow at the front of the aggregation was insensitive to the presence of downstream swimmers, with the induced flow tending towards asymptotic beyond a threshold aggregation length. Closer swimmer spacing led to higher induced flow speeds, in some cases leading to model predictions of induced flow exceeding swimmer speeds required to maintain a stable spatial configuration. This result was reconciled by comparing two different models for the near-wake of each swimmer. The results demonstrate that aggregation-scale flows result from a complex, yet predictable interplay between individual organism wake structure and aggregation configuration and size.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>

Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lagrangian averaging with exponential filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging is a valuable tool for the analysis and modelling of multiscale processes in fluid dynamics. The numerical computation of Lagrangian (time) averages from simulation data is challenging, however. It can be carried out by tracking a large number of particles or, following a recent approach, by solving a dedicated set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Both approaches are computationally demanding because they require an entirely new computation for each time at which the Lagrangian mean fields are desired.
  We overcome this drawback by developing a PDE-based method that delivers Lagrangian mean fields for all times through the single solution of evolutionary PDEs. This allows for an on-the-fly implementation, in which Lagrangian averages are computed along with the dynamical variables. This is made possible by the use of a special class of temporal filters whose kernels are sums of exponential functions.
  We focus on two specific kernels involving one and two exponential functions. We implement these in the rotating shallow-water model and demonstrate their effectiveness at filtering out large-amplitude Poincar\'e waves while retaining the salient features of an underlying slowly evolving turbulent flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) is a collection of thunderstorms that function as a system, representing a widely discussed phenomenon in both the natural sciences and visual effects industries, and embodying the untamed forces of nature.In this paper, we present the first interactive, physically inspired mesoscale thunderstorms simulation model that integrates Grabowski-style cloud microphysics with atmospheric electrification processes. Our model simulates thunderclouds development and lightning flashes within a unified meteorological framework, providing a realistic and interactive approach for graphical applications. By incorporating key physical principles, it effectively links cloud formation, electrification, and lightning generation. The simulation also encompasses various thunderstorm types and their corresponding lightning activities.</description>

      <title>A variational front-tracking method for multiphase flow with triple junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

      <title>Fluid dynamics duality and solution of decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a duality in the dynamics of incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids in three dimensions, leading to a reformulation of the problem as a one-dimensional momentum loop equation. \textbf{Importantly, the momentum loop equation does not admit finite-time blow-up solutions.}
  The phenomenon of decaying turbulence emerges as a solution to this equation and can be interpreted as a string theory with a discrete target space composed of regular star polygons and Ising degrees of freedom along their edges. This string theory is solvable in the turbulent limit, which corresponds to a quasiclassical approximation in a nontrivial, calculable background.
  As a result, the spectrum of decay exponents is derived analytically and exhibits excellent agreement with both experimental data and numerical simulations. Notably, the spectrum includes complex conjugate pairs of exponents associated with the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The classical Kolmogorov scaling laws are replaced by specific functions derived from number theory, exhibiting nonlinear behavior in log-log scale.
  In particular, we compare the theoretically predicted effective exponent for the second moment of the velocity difference with new DNS results. This comparison reveals a remarkable agreement, with deviations well within the small DNS error margin over a broad range of the scaling variable $r/\sqrt{t}$.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow channeling and mass transport with discontinuous porosity distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flow of fluids within porous rocks is an important process with numerous applications in Earth sciences. Modeling the compaction-driven fluid flow requires the solution of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that account for the fluid flow and the solid deformation within the porous medium. Despite the nonlinear relation of porosity and permeability that is commonly encountered, natural data show evidence of channelized fluid flow in rocks that have an overall layered structure. Layers of different rock types routinely have discontinuous hydraulic and mechanical properties. We present numerical results obtained by a novel space-time method which can handle discontinuous initial porosity (and permeability) distributions. The space-time method enables a straightforward coupling to models of mass transport for trace elements. Our results show the influence of different kinds of layering in the development of fluid-rich channels and mass transport.</description>
