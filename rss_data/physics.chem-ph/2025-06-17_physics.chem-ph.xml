      <title>Accurate Chemistry Collection: Coupled cluster atomization energies for broad chemical space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate thermochemical data with sub-chemical accuracy (i.e., within $\pm$1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ from sufficiently accurate experimental or theoretical reference data) is essential for the development and improvement of computational chemistry methods. Challenging thermochemical properties such as heats of formation and total atomization energies (TAEs) are of particular interest because they rigorously test the ability of computational chemistry methods to accurately describe complex chemical transformations involving multiple bond rearrangements. Yet, existing thermochemical datasets that confidently reach this level of accuracy are limited in either size or scope. Datasets with highly accurate reference values include a small number of data points, and larger datasets provide less accurate data or only cover a narrow portion of the chemical space. The existing datasets are therefore insufficient for developing data-driven methods with predictive accuracy over a large chemical space. The Microsoft Research Accurate Chemistry Collection (MSR-ACC) will address this challenge. Here, it offers the MSR-ACC/TAE25 dataset of 76,879 total atomization energies obtained at the CCSD(T)/CBS level via the W1-F12 thermochemical protocol. The dataset is constructed to exhaustively cover chemical space for all elements up to argon by enumerating and sampling chemical graphs, thus avoiding bias towards any particular subspace of the chemical space (such as drug-like, organic, or experimentally observed molecules). With this first dataset in MSR-ACC, we enable data-driven approaches for developing predictive computational chemistry methods with unprecedented accuracy and scope.</description>

      <title>Shake-down spectroscopy as state- and site-specific probe of ultrafast chemical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the multifarious ultrafast electronic and structural changes occurring in a molecule during a photochemical transformation is a challenging endeavor that benefits from recent experimental and computational progress in time-resolved techniques. Measurements of valence electronic states, which provide a global picture of the bonding structure of the molecule, and core electronic states, which provide insight into the local environment, traditionally require different approaches and are often studied separately. Here, we demonstrate that X-ray pulses from a seeded free-electron laser (FEL) enable the measurement of high-resolution, time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) that capture weak satellite states resulting from shake-down processes in a valence-excited molecule. This approach effectively combines the advantages of both valence- and core-state investigations. We applied this method to investigate photoexcited CS$_2$ molecules, where the role of internal conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) in determining the pre-dissociation dynamics is controversial. We present XPS spectra from photoexcited CS$_2$, obtained at the FERMI FEL. High-resolution measurements, compared to the corresponding spectra obtained from accurate multireference quantum chemical calculations, reveal that shake-down satellite channels are highly sensitive to both valence electronic and geometric changes. Previous studies of the pre-dissociation dynamics have led to uncertain assignments around the branching between singlet and triplet excited states. We derived a propensity rule that demonstrates the spin-selectivity of the shake-downs. This selectivity allows us to unequivocally assign contributions from the bright and dark singlet excited states with populations tracked along the pre-dissociation dynamic pathway.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>About explosive delayed desorption from methane-doped argon matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The features of delayed desorption from CH4-doped Ar matrices irradiated with an electron beam of subthreshold energy were studied. Radiolysis products were detected by emission spectroscopy. The total desorption yield was monitored by recording the pressure in the experimental chamber. Based on the analysis of the concentration dependence of delayed desorption bursts and their structure, an assumption was made about the formation of CH4 clusters in Ar matrices. At a high dopant concentration of 10%, up to three consecutive bursts were recorded. Delayed desorption from a sample doped with 0.1% CH4 was registered for the first time. A correlation has been found between the burst of particles and the flash of luminescence of H atoms. This seemingly contradictory observation of the correlation of the H atom content with the particle explosion due to their recombination was explained by analyzing the energy transfer and capture processes and the features of the energy structure of H2 molecule. A linear dependence of the total particle yield on the CH4 concentration in the range of 1-10% was found. The dynamics of intensity changes in the sequence of main flashes and their delay time were discussed.</description>

      <title>First-passage time to capture for diffusion in a 3D harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the survival probability and first-passage time (FPT) to capture for a harmonically trapped particle, diffusing outside an absorbing spherical boundary by directly solving the differential equation for the survival probability. This solution, obtained as an infinite sum over the relevant eigenfunctions, corrects previously published results [D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014)]. To verify our calculations, we perform simulations of the survival probability, that accurately reproduce the analytic solutions for a range of parameter values. We then obtain the corresponding FPT distribution as the negative time derivative of the survival probability. Finally, we derive an expression for mean first-passage time (MFPT), also as a sum over eigenfunctions. Numerical evaluation of the first twenty-five terms in this sum closely matches the MFPT obtained by a different method in D. S. Grebenkov, J. Phys. A 48, 013001 (2014). We also find that, in the limit of vanishing trap stiffness, the amplitude of the first term in our infinite-sum solution for the survival probability matches the theoretical escape probability for the potential-free diffusion-to-capture process.</description>

      <title>Transferability and interpretability of vibrational normalizing-flow coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of vibrational coordinates is crucial for the accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability of molecular vibrational dynamics and spectra calculations. We explore the recently proposed normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates, which are learned molecule-specific coordinate transformations optimized for a given basis set. Much like how spherical coordinates naturally simplify the hydrogen atom by embedding physical insight into the coordinate system, normalizing-flow coordinates offload complexity from the basis functions into the coordinate transformation itself. This shift not only improves basis-set convergence, but also enhances interpretability of vibrational motions. We provide an analysis of the utility, interpretation and associated constraints of normalizing-flow vibrational coordinates. Moreover, we demonstrate that these coordinates can be generalized across different isotopologues, and even structurally related molecules, achieved with minimal fine-tuning of selected output parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications.
  Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.</description>

      <title>Multireference equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group: theoretical foundations and applications to ionized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of an equation-of-motion (EOM) extension of the multireference driven similarity renormalization group (MR-DSRG) formalism for ionization potentials (IP-EOM-DSRG). The IP-EOM-DSRG formalism results in a Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problem, delivering accurate ionization potentials for systems with strongly correlated ground and excited states. The EOM step scales as $O(N^5)$ with the basis set size $N$, allowing for efficient calculation of spectroscopic properties, such as transition energies and intensities. The IP-EOM-DSRG formalism is combined with three truncation schemes of the parent MR-DSRG theory: an iterative nonperturbative method with up to two-body excitations [MR-LDSRG(2)] and second- and third-order perturbative approximations [DSRG-MRPT2/3]. We benchmark these variants by computing 1) the vertical valence ionization potentials of a series of small molecules at both equilibrium and stretched geometries; 2) the spectroscopic constants of several low-lying electronic states of the OH, CN, N2+, and CO+ radicals; and 3) the binding curves of low-lying electronic states of the CN radical. A comparison with experimental data and theoretical results shows that all three IP-EOM-DSRG methods accurately reproduce the vertical ionization potentials and spectroscopic constants of these systems. Notably, the DSRG-MRPT3 and MR-LDSRG(2) versions outperform several state-of-the-art multireference methods of comparable or higher cost.</description>

      <title>Topological descriptors for the electron density of inorganic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Descriptors play an important role in data-driven materials design. While most descriptors of crystalline materials emphasize structure and composition, they often neglect the electron density - a complex yet fundamental quantity that governs material properties. Here, we introduce Betti curves as topological descriptors that compress electron densities into compact representations. Derived from persistent homology, Betti curves capture bonding characteristics by encoding components, cycles, and voids across varied electron density thresholds. Machine learning models trained on Betti curves outperform those trained on raw electron densities by an average of 33 percentage points in classifying structure prototypes, predicting thermodynamic stability, and distinguishing metals from non-metals. Shannon entropy calculations reveal that Betti curves retain comparable information content to electron density while requiring two orders of magnitude less data. By combining expressive power with compact representation, Betti curves highlight the potential of topological data analysis to advance materials design.</description>
