      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Forecasting with an N-dimensional Langevin Equation and a Neural-Ordinary Differential Equation</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity day-ahead prices is essential in competitive electricity markets. Although stationary electricity-price forecasting techniques have received considerable attention, research on non-stationary methods is comparatively scarce, despite the common prevalence of non-stationary features in electricity markets. Specifically, existing non-stationary techniques will often aim to address individual non-stationary features in isolation, leaving aside the exploration of concurrent multiple non-stationary effects. Our overarching objective here is the formulation of a framework to systematically model and forecast non-stationary electricity-price time series, encompassing the broader scope of non-stationary behavior. For this purpose we develop a data-driven model that combines an N-dimensional Langevin equation (LE) with a neural-ordinary differential equation (NODE). The LE captures fine-grained details of the electricity-price behavior in stationary regimes but is inadequate for non-stationary conditions. To overcome this inherent limitation, we adopt a NODE approach to learn, and at the same time predict, the difference between the actual electricity-price time series and the simulated price trajectories generated by the LE. By learning this difference, the NODE reconstructs the non-stationary components of the time series that the LE is not able to capture. We exemplify the effectiveness of our framework using the Spanish electricity day-ahead market as a prototypical case study. Our findings reveal that the NODE nicely complements the LE, providing a comprehensive strategy to tackle both stationary and non-stationary electricity-price behavior. The framework's dependability and robustness is demonstrated through different non-stationary scenarios by comparing it against a range of basic naive methods.</description>

      <title>Precise influence evaluation in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating node influence is fundamental for identifying key nodes in complex networks. Existing methods typically rely on generic indicators to rank node influence across diverse networks, thereby ignoring the individualized features of each network itself. Actually, node influence stems not only from general features but the multi-scale individualized information encompassing specific network structure and task. Here we design an active learning architecture to predict node influence quantitively and precisely, which samples representative nodes based on graph entropy correlation matrix integrating multi-scale individualized information. This brings two intuitive advantages: (1) discovering potential high-influence but weak-connected nodes that are usually ignored in existing methods, (2) improving the influence maximization strategy by deducing influence interference. Significantly, our architecture demonstrates exceptional transfer learning capabilities across multiple types of networks, which can identify those key nodes with large disputation across different existing methods. Additionally, our approach, combined with a simple greedy algorithm, exhibits dominant performance in solving the influence maximization problem. This architecture holds great potential for applications in graph mining and prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained polynomial chaos expansion for scientific machine learning and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel physics-constrained polynomial chaos expansion as a surrogate modeling method capable of performing both scientific machine learning (SciML) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks. The proposed method possesses a unique capability: it seamlessly integrates SciML into UQ and vice versa, which allows it to quantify the uncertainties in SciML tasks effectively and leverage SciML for improved uncertainty assessment during UQ-related tasks. The proposed surrogate model can effectively incorporate a variety of physical constraints, such as governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with associated initial and boundary conditions constraints, inequality-type constraints (e.g., monotonicity, convexity, non-negativity, among others), and additional a priori information in the training process to supplement limited data. This ensures physically realistic predictions and significantly reduces the need for expensive computational model evaluations to train the surrogate model. Furthermore, the proposed method has a built-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) feature to efficiently estimate output uncertainties. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to a diverse set of problems, including linear/non-linear PDEs with deterministic and stochastic parameters, data-driven surrogate modeling of a complex physical system, and UQ of a stochastic system with parameters modeled as random fields.</description>
