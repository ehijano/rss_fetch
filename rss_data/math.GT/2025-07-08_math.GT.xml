      <title>Analogue of Goeritz matrices for computation of bipartite HOMFLY-PT polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goeritz matrix is an alternative to the Kauffman bracket and, in addition, makes it possible to calculate the Jones polynomial faster with some minimal choice of a checkerboard surface of a link diagram. We introduce a modification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for computing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of bipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices, and therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite links form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links constructed from the so-called rational tangles. We demonstrate how to obtain a bipartite diagram of such links and calculate the corresponding HOMFLY-PT polynomials using our developed generalized Goeritz method.</description>

      <title>Cable links of uniformly thick knot types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Legendrian realizations of cable links of knot types that are uniformly thick but not Legendrian simple, extending prior work of Dalton, the second author, and Traynor. This leads to new phenomena, such as Legendrian links that are smoothly isotopic and component-wise Legendrian isotopic, but are not Legendrian isotopic. In our study, we establish new results for cable links whose cable slope is sufficiently negative. We will also show how to classify Legendrian knots in (most) negative cables of twist knots. This is done by introducing a new technique to the study of cables based on Legendrian surgeries.</description>

      <title>More Exotic $\mathbb{RP}^2$-knots and Homotopy Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the infinite family of exotic embeddings $\mathbb{RP}^2 \hookrightarrow S^4$ constructed by Miyazawa to a strictly larger family of exotic embeddings, by showing that in place of the pretzel knot $P(-2, 3, 7)$, an infinite family of knots may be used as input to the construction. To this end, we prove that for any Montesinos knot of the form $K(2,3,|6s+1|)$, the branched double cover of the corresponding roll-spun knot is a homotopy sphere. This in turn produces a larger family of homotopy spheres and homotopy $\mathbb{CP}^2$s with potentially interesting involutions. We also observe that Miyazawa's homotopy sphere can be obtained from $S^4$ by a Gluck twist.</description>

      <title>Bonded braids and the Markov theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bonded knots arise naturally in topological protein modeling, where intramolecular interactions such as disulfide bridges stabilize folded configurations. These structures extend classical knot theory by incorporating embedded graphs, and have been formalized as bonded knots. In this paper, we develop the algebraic theory of bonded braids, introducing the bonded braid monoid in the topological and rigid settings, which encodes both classical braid crossings and (rigid) bonded connections. We prove bonded analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems, establishing that every bonded knot arises as the closure of a bonded braid and that two bonded knots are equivalent if and only if their braid representatives are related by a finite sequence of algebraic (Markov-like) moves. In addition, we define the bonded Burau and reduced bonded Burau representations of the monoid, extending classical braid group representations to the bonded setting, and analyze their (non-)faithfulness in low dimensions.</description>

      <title>Jones Polynomials and their Zeros for a Family of Knots and Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate Jones polynomials $V(H_r,t)$ for a family of alternating knots and links $H_r$ with arbitrarily many crossings $r$, by computing the Tutte polynomials $T(G_+(H_r),x,y)$ for the associated graphs $G_+(H_r)$ and evaluating these with $x=-t$ and $y=-1/t$. Our method enables us to circumvent the generic feature that the computational complexity of $V(L_r,t)$ for a knot or link $L_r$ for generic $t$ grows exponentially rapidly with $r$. We also study the accumulation set of the zeros of these polynomials in the limit of infinitely many crossings, $r \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>On ADEG-polyhedra in hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the non-zero dihedral angles of hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra of large dimensions are not arbitrarily small. Namely, for dimensions $n\geq 32$, they are of the form $\frac{\pi}{m}$ with $m\leq 6$. Moreover, this property holds in all dimensions $n\geq 7$ for Coxeter polyhedra with mutually intersecting facets. Then, we develop a constructive procedure tailored to Coxeter polyhedra with prescribed dihedral angles, from which we derive the complete classification of ADEG-polyhedra, characterized by having no pair of disjoint facets and dihedral angles $\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{3}$ and $\frac{\pi}{6}$, only. Besides some well-known simplices and pyramids, there are three exceptional polyhedra, one of which is a new polyhedron $P_{\star}\subset \mathbb H^9$ with $14$ facets.</description>

      <title>The classification of links up to clasp-pass moves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete classification of links up to clasp-pass moves, which coincides with Habiro's $C_3$-equivalence. We also classify links up to band-pass and band-# moves, which are versions of the usual pass- and #-move, respectively, where each pair of parallel strands belong to the same component. This recovers and generalizes widely a number of partial results in the study of these local moves. The proofs make use of clasper theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\omega$ be a Kahler form on $M$, which is a torus $T^4$, a $K3$ surface or an Enriques surface, let $M\#n\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ be $n-$point Kahler blowup of $M$. Suppose that $\kappa=[\omega]$ satisfies certain irrationality condition. Applying techniques related to deformation of complex objects, we extend the guage-theoretic invariant on closed Kahler suraces developed by Kronheimer\cite{Kronheimer1998} and Smirnov\cite{Smirnov2022}\cite{Smirnov2023}. As a result, we show that even dimensional higher homotopy groups of $\Symp(M\#n\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2},\omega)$ are infinitely generated.</description>

Abstract: We review the main achievements regarding the interactions between gem theory (which makes use of edge-colored graphs to represent PL-manifolds of arbitrary dimension) and both the classical representation of PL 4-manifolds via Kirby diagrams and the more recent one via trisections. Original results also appear (in particular, about gems representing closed 4-manifolds which need 3-handles in their handle decomposition, as well as about trisection diagrams), together with open problems and further possible applications to the study of compact PL 4-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building further on work of Marin and Wagner, we give a braid-type skein theory of the Links-Gould polynomial invariant of oriented links, prove that it can be used to evaluate any oriented link and prove that it is also shared by the $V_1$-polynomial defined by two of the authors, deducing the equality of the two link polynomials. This implies specialization properties of the $V_1$-polynomial to the Alexander polynomial and to the $\mathrm{ADO}_3$-invariant, the fact that it is a Vassiliev power series invariant, as well as a Seifert genus bound for knots.</description>

Abstract: For a connected orientable hyperbolic surface $S$ without boundary and of finite topological type, the Johnson kernel ${\mathcal K}(S)$ is the subgroup of the mapping class group of $S$ generated by Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves on $S$. We prove that ${\mathcal K}(S)$ is generated by the Dehn twists about separating simple closed curves on $S$ bounding either: a closed subsurface of genus $1$ or $2$; a closed subsurface of genus $1$ minus one point; a closed disc minus two points.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances, Borsuk-Ulam theorems, and Vietoris-Rips complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore emerging relationships between the Gromov--Hausdorff distance, Borsuk--Ulam theorems, and Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes. The Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces $X$ and~$Y$ can be lower bounded by the distortion of (possibly discontinuous) functions between them. The more these functions must distort the metrics, the larger the Gromov--Hausdorff distance must be. Topology has few tools to obstruct the existence of discontinuous functions. However, an arbitrary function $f\colon X\to Y$ induces a continuous map between their Vietoris--Rips simplicial complexes, where the allowable choices of scale parameters depend on how much the function $f$ distorts distances. We can then use equivariant topology to obstruct the existence of certain continuous maps between Vietoris--Rips complexes. With these ideas we bound how discontinuous an odd map between spheres $S^k\to S^n$ with $k&gt;n$ must be, generalizing a result by Dubins and Schwarz (1981), which is the case $k=n+1$. As an application, we recover or improve upon all of the lower bounds from Lim, M{\'e}moli, and Smith (2022) on the Gromov--Hausdorff distances between spheres of different dimensions. We also provide new upper bounds on the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between spheres of adjacent dimensions.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions of principal connections and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>
