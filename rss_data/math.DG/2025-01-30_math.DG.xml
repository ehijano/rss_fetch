      <title>Two-dimensional Calderon problem and flat metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with boundary $\partial M$, the Diri\-chl\-et-to-Neumann operator $\Lambda_g:C^\infty(\partial M)\longrightarrow C^\infty(\partial M)$ is defined by $\Lambda_gf=\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}\right|_{\partial M}$, where $\nu$ is the unit outer normal vector to the boundary and $u$ is the solution to the Dirichlet problem $\Delta_gu=0,\ u|_{\partial M}=f$. Let $g_\partial$ be the Riemannian metric on $\partial M$ induced by $g$. The Calderon problem is posed as follows: To what extent is $(M,g)$ determined by the data $(\partial M,g_\partial,\Lambda_g)$? We prove the uniqueness theorem: A compact connected two-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with non-empty boundary is determined by the data $(\partial M,g_\partial,\Lambda_g)$ uniquely up to conformal equivalence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a Lie groupoid integrating the elliptic tangent bundle associated to a (possibly normal crossing) elliptic divisor, providing a necessary and sufficient topological condition for the existence of a Hausdorff integration. We also produce an explicit local model for the symplectic integration of an elliptic Poisson structure.</description>

      <title>Spectral flow of Callias operators, odd K-cowaist, and positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a complete Riemannian manifold $M$, we study the spectral flow of a family of Callias operators on $M$. We derive a codimension zero formula when dimension of $M$ is odd and a codimension one formula when dimension of $M$ is even. These can be seen as analogues of Gromov--Lawson's relative index theorem and classical Callias index theorem, respectively. Secondly, we introduce an intrinsic definition of K-cowaist on odd-dimensional manifolds, making use of the odd Chern character of a smooth map from $M$ to a unitary group. It behaves just like the usual K-cowaist on even-dimensional manifolds. We then apply the notion of odd K-cowaist and the tool of spectral flow to investigate problems related to positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds. In particular, we prove infinite odd K-cowaist to be an obstruction to the existence of PSC metrics. We obtain quantitative scalar curvature estimates on complete non-compact manifolds and scalar-mean curvature estimates on compact manifolds with boundary. They extend several previous results optimally, which unfolds a major advantage of our method via spectral flow and odd K-cowaist.</description>

      <title>FFT-based Alignment of 2d Closed Curves with Application to Elastic Shape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many shape analysis problems in computer vision and scientific imaging (e.g., computational anatomy, morphological cytometry), the ability to align two closed curves in the plane is crucial. In this paper, we concentrate on rigidly aligning pairs of closed curves in the plane. If the curves have the same length and are centered at the origin, the critical steps to an optimal rigid alignment are finding the best rotation for one curve to match the other and redefining the starting point of the rotated curve so that the starting points of the two curves match. Unlike open curves, closed curves do not have fixed starting points, and this introduces an additional degree of freedom in the alignment. Hence the common naive method to find the best rotation and starting point for optimal rigid alignment has O(N^2) time complexity, N the number of nodes per curve. This can be slow for curves with large numbers of nodes. In this paper, we propose a new O(N log N) algorithm for this problem based on the Fast Fourier Transform. Together with uniform resampling of the curves with respect to arc length, the new algorithm results in an order of magnitude speed-up in our experiments. Additionally, we describe how we can use our new algorithm as part of elastic shape distance computations between closed curves to obtain accurate shape distance values at a fraction of the cost of previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Relative eta invariant and uniformly positive scalar curvature on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On complete non-compact manifolds with bounded sectional curvature, we consider a class of self-adjoint Dirac-type operators called Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators. Assuming two Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators coincide at infinity, by previous work, one can define their relative eta invariant. A typical example of Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators is the (twisted) spin Dirac operators on spin manifolds which admit a Riemannian metric of uniformly positive scalar curvature. In this case, using the relative eta invariant, we get a geometric formula for the spectral flow on non-compact manifolds, which induces a new proof of Gromov-Lawson's result about compact area enlargeable manifolds in odd dimensions. When two such spin Dirac operators are the boundary restriction of an operator on a manifold with non-compact boundary, under certain conditions, we obtain an index formula involving the relative eta invariant. This generalizes the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to non-compact boundary situation. As a result, we can use the relative eta invariant to study the space of uniformly positive scalar curvature metrics on some non-compact connected sums.</description>

      <title>Positive $\mathrm{Ric}_2$ curvature on products of spheres and their quotients via intermediate fatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct metrics of positive $2^{\rm nd}$ intermediate Ricci curvature, $\mathrm{Ric}_2&gt;0$, on closed manifolds of dimensions 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, including $\mathbb{S}^6\times\mathbb{S}^7$, $\mathbb{S}^7\times\mathbb{S}^7$ and all their simply connected isometric quotients. In particular, we obtain infinitely many examples in dimension 13. We also produce infinitely many non-simply connected spaces with $\mathrm{Ric}_2&gt;0$ in dimensions 13 and 14, including $\mathbb{RP}^6\times \mathbb{RP}^7$ and $\mathbb{RP}^7\times \mathbb{RP}^7$, which cannot admit a metric of positive sectional curvature. The main new idea is a generalization of the concept of fatness which ensures the existence of $\mathrm{Ric}_2&gt;0$ metrics on the total space of certain homogeneous bundles.</description>

      <title>Remark on Laplacians and Riemannian Submersions with Totally Geodesic Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian submersion $(M,g) \to (B,j)$ each of whose fibers is connected and totally geodesic, we consider a certain 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics $(g_{t})_{t &gt; 0}$ on $M$, which is called the canonical variation. Let $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})$ be the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator $\Delta^{M}_{g_{t}}$ and $\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})$ the volume of $(M, g_{t})$. In 1982, B\'{e}rard-Bergery and Bourguignon showed that the scale-invariant quantity $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $0$ with $t$. In this paper, we prove that if each fiber is Einstein and $(M,g)$ satisfies a certain condition about its Ricci curvature, then $\lambda_{1}(g_{t})\mbox{Vol}(M,g_{t})^{2/\mbox{dim}M}$ goes to $\infty$ with $t$. We consider many examples. In particular, we consider Riemannian submersions from compact rank one symmetric spaces and the twistor fibration of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold of positive scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Laplacian Eigenvalues on Surfaces with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Rohleder proposed a new variational approach to an inequality between the Neumann and Dirichlet eigenvalues in the simply connected planar case using the language of classical vector analysis. Writing his approach in terms of differential forms permits to generalize these results to a much broader context. The spectrum of the absolute boundary problem for the Hodge-Laplacian on a Riemannian manifold with boundary is presented as a union of the spectra of the absolute boundary problem on the spaces of closed and co-exact forms. An inequality for the eigenvalues of the absolute boundary problem for the Hodge-Laplacian and the Dirichlet boundary problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the Euclidean case is obtained using this presentation. The Rohleder's results are obtained as corollaries of a more general theorem.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of 3-webs around a point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let W be a planar 3-web defined on a neighborhood of a point M. We call "symmetry of W around M" any local diffeomorphism which fixes M and maps each foliation of W to a (not necessarily the same) foliation of W. We say that it is a simple symmetry if it respects each foliation, a mirror symmetry if its respects one foliation and permutes the two other and a circular symmetry if it permutes circularly the three foliations.
  Hexagonal (i.e. flat) planar 3-webs have always the three types of symmetry. We study here the non-flat case. We give a classification of 3-webs which admits simple or mirror symmetries. We give a method to build all the 3-webs with a circular symmetry and we exhibit a precise non-flat example.</description>
