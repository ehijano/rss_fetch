      <title>Constructions of symplectic surfaces in symplectic 4-manifolds with transversal intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the breakthrough paper [V. Mu\~noz, A Smale-Barden manifold admitting K-contact but not Sasakian structure, 2024, 10.4171/JEMS/1496], it is constructed the first example of a simply connected compact 5-manifold (aka.\ Smale-Barden manifold) which admits a K-contact structure but does not carry a Sasakian structure, thus settling the question raised as Open Problem 10.2.1 in n [C. Boyer and K. Galicki, Sasakian Geometry, OUP, 2007]. In this paper we revise, refine and generalize the constructions of symplectic surfaces in a symplectic 4-manifold with transversal intersections. These are needed to produce the ramification locus of Seifert bundles over symplectic 4-orbifolds that serve to produce K-contact 5-manifolds.</description>

      <title>RTD-Lite: Scalable Topological Analysis for Comparing Weighted Graphs in Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological methods for comparing weighted graphs are valuable in various learning tasks but often suffer from computational inefficiency on large datasets. We introduce RTD-Lite, a scalable algorithm that efficiently compares topological features, specifically connectivity or cluster structures at arbitrary scales, of two weighted graphs with one-to-one correspondence between vertices. Using minimal spanning trees in auxiliary graphs, RTD-Lite captures topological discrepancies with $O(n^2)$ time and memory complexity. This efficiency enables its application in tasks like dimensionality reduction and neural network training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RTD-Lite effectively identifies topological differences while significantly reducing computation time compared to existing methods. Moreover, integrating RTD-Lite into neural network training as a loss function component enhances the preservation of topological structures in learned representations.

      <title>The degeneration of Calabi-Yau 3-folds via 3-forms and the SYZ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometries associated with 3-forms of various orbital types on a symplectic 6-manifold. We demonstrate that certain unstable 3-forms, which naturally emerge from specific degenerations of Calabi-Yau structures, exhibit remarkably rich geometric properties. This, in turn, offers a novel perspective on the SYZ conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>The mapping class group action on the odd character variety is faithful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The odd character variety of a Riemann surface is a moduli space of SO(3) representations of the fundamental group which can be interpreted as the moduli space of stable holomorphic rank 2 bundles of odd degree and fixed determinant. This is a symplectic manifold, and there is a homomorphism from a finite extension of the mapping class group of the surface to the symplectic mapping class group of this moduli space. When the genus is at least 2, it is shown that this homomomorphism is injective. This answers a question posed by Dostoglou and Salamon and generalizes a theorem of Smith from the genus 2 case to arbitrary genus. A corresponding result on the faithfulness of the action on the Fukaya category of the odd character variety is also proved. The proofs use instanton Floer homology, a version of the Atiyah-Floer Conjecture, and aspects of a strategy used by Clarkson in the Heegaard Floer setting.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation and Simplicity in Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general axiomatic theorem establishing the conditions for a group homomorphism to possess a simple kernel, based on fragmentation, transitivity, and perfectness properties. This extends classical results in geometric group theory and finds specific applications in the study of cosymplectic manifolds. We prove a fragmentation lemma for weakly Hamiltonian cosymplectic diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds with periodic Reeb flow and establish the discreteness of the cosymplectic flux group. We show that a closed cosymplectic manifold has periodic Reeb flow. Using these results, we prove the perfectness, fragmentation, and simplicity of the group of weakly Hamiltonian cosymplectic diffeomorphisms, together with a theorem of Liouville integrability in cosymplectic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic 4-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian RP^2s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as hypersurfaces of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigation on S^1-invariant contact structures also suggests there should be a universal upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the singularity).</description>
