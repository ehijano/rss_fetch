      <title>Improved universality bounds for directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove universality of Tracy-Widom GUE fluctuations for directed polymers in $1+1$ dimensions in the intermediate disorder regime. Building on the Lindeberg replacement method of arXiv:2304.04871, we refine estimates for the measure of steep paths using probabilistic arguments. Our result extends the admissible range of the inverse temperature scaling parameter $\beta = n^{-\alpha}$ to all $\alpha \in (2/(3K+11), 1/4)$, provided the weights match $K$ moments with the log-Gamma distribution. For a general class of distributions, this gives universality for $\alpha &gt; 2/17$, and when the third moment vanishes, this threshold improves to $\alpha &gt; 1/10$. These results substantially broaden the known range of universality for directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime.</description>

      <title>Vector-valued Gaussian free field conditioned to avoid a ball: Entropic repulsion of the norm and Freezing of spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the laws of the two-dimensional vector-valued Dirichlet Gaussian free field and its massive lattice counterpart, conditioned to avoid a ball at every site of a subdomain. We prove that, under this conditioning, the norm of the massless field exhibits entropic repulsion, while its angular components freeze at all mesoscopic scales. A key step in the analysis is showing that around any given point in the bulk of the range, the unconditioned field has no holes.
  In the massive case, the conditioned field behaves differently: its norm remains uniformly bounded as the system size grows, leading to the existence of infinite-volume Gibbs measures. Furthermore, in the scalar massive case, the system undergoes a phase transition in the size of the avoided interval: for small intervals, the system admits a unique infinite-volume limit, while for sufficiently large centered intervals, multiple such limits exist.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov equations for stochastic Volterra processes with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate backward and forward Kolmogorov equations to a class of fully nonlinear Stochastic Volterra Equations (SVEs) with convolution kernels $K$ that are singular at the origin. Working on a carefully chosen Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$, we rigorously establish a link between solutions of SVEs and Markovian mild solutions of a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) of transport-type. Then, we obtain two novel It\^o formulae for functionals of mild solutions and, as a byproduct, show that their laws solve corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. Finally, we introduce a natural notion of "singular" directional derivatives along $K$ and prove that (conditional) expectations of SVE solutions can be expressed in terms of the unique solution to a backward Kolmogorov equation on $\mathcal{H}_1$. Our analysis relies on stochastic calculus in Hilbert spaces, the reproducing kernel property of the state space $\mathcal{H}_1,$ as well as crucial invariance and smoothing properties that are specific to the SPDEs of interest. In the special case of singular power-law kernels, our conditions guarantee well-posedness of the backward equation either for all values of the Hurst parameter $H,$ when the noise is additive, or for all $H&gt;1/4$ when the noise is multiplicative.</description>

      <title>Coupling Theory, Optimal Transport, and Strassen's Theorem Beyond Regular Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many results in probability (most famously, Strassen's theorem on stochastic domination), characterize some relationship between probability distributions in terms of the existence of a particular structured coupling between them. Optimal transport, and in particular Kantorovich duality, provides a framework for formally unifying these results, but the standard duality theory requires topological conditions that are not satisfied in some settings. In this work, we investigate the extent to which Kantorovich duality still provides meaningful connections between distributional relations and their coupling counterparts, in the topologically irregular setting. Towards this end, we show that Strassen's theorem ``nearly holds'' for topologically irregular orders but that the full theorem admits counterexamples. The core of the proof is a novel technical result in optimal transport, which shows that the Kantorovich dual problem is well-behaved for optimal transport problems whose cost functions can be written as a non-increasing limit of lower semi-continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Earthquake modelling via Brownian motions on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general model for Brownian motions on metric graphs with interactions. In a general setting, for (sticky) Brownian propagations on edges, our model provides a characterization of lifetimes and holding times on vertices in terms of (jumping) Brownian accumulation of energy associated with that vertices. Propagation and accumulation are given by drifted Brownian motions subjected to non-local (also dynamic) boundary conditions. As the continuous (sticky) process approaches a vertex, then the right-continuous process has a restart (resetting), it jumps randomly away from the zero-level of energy. According with this new energy, the continuous process can start (or not) as a new process in a randomly chosen edge. We provide a self-contained presentation with a detailed construction of the model. The model well extends to a higher order of interactions, here we provide a simple case and focus on the analysis of earthquakes. Earthquakes are notoriously difficult to study. They build up over long periods and release energy in seconds. Our goal is to introduce a new model, useful in many contexts and in particular in the difficult attempt to manage seismic risks.</description>

      <title>On the differentiability of the local time of the ($1+\beta$)-stable super-Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the local time of the ($1+\beta$)-stable super-Brownian motion with $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$. It is shown by Mytnik and Perkins ({\em Ann. Probab.}, 31(3), 1413 -- 1440, (2003)) that the local time, denoted by $L(t,x)$, is jointly continuous in $d=1$ while $L(t,x)$ is locally unbounded in $x$ in $d\geq 2$ where it exists. This paper shows that the local time is continuously differentiable in the spatial parameter $x$ in $d=1$. Moreover, we give a representation of the spatial derivative of the local time, denoted by $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}L(t,x)$, and further prove that the derivative is locally $\gamma$-H\"older continuous in $x$ with any index $\gamma \in (0, \frac{\beta}{1+\beta})$.</description>

      <title>Multiradial SLE with spiral: resampling property and boundary perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multiple radial SLE curves with various time parameterizations and possible spiraling behavior. We construct them by tilting independent radial SLEs with a suitable local martingale, generalizing the earlier construction by Healey and Lawler. We prove that the curves are almost surely transient (i.e., they emanate from boundary points and terminate at a common interior target point). We show that they enjoy the resampling property: conditional on all of the curves but one, the remaining curve is distributed as chordal SLE in the remaining domain. We also verify that the multiradial SLE measure satisfies a natural boundary perturbation property analogous to that of the known SLE variants, involving its partition function (which is finite).
  Interestingly, in the parlance of Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, partition functions of multiradial SLE processes with spiral involve both electric and magnetic charges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work will appear as a chapter in a forthcoming volume titled `Topics in Probabilistic Graph Theory'.
  For a given graph $G$, each partition of the vertices has a modularity score, with higher values indicating that the partition better captures community structure in $G$. The modularity $q^*(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum over all vertex-partitions of the modularity score, and satisfies $0\leq q^*(G)&lt; 1$. Modularity lies at the heart of the most popular algorithms for community detection. In this chapter we discuss the behaviour of the modularity of various kinds of random graphs, starting with the binomial random graph $G_{n,p}$ with $n$ vertices and edge-probability $p$.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued multifractal processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifractal scaling has been extensively studied for real-valued stochastic processes, but a systematic integer-valued analogue has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a multifractal framework for integer-valued processes using the thinning operation, which serves as a natural discrete counterpart to scalar multiplication. Within this framework, we construct integer-valued multifractal processes by time changing compound Poisson processes with nondecreasing multifractal clocks. We derive the scaling laws of their moments, provide explicit examples, and illustrate the results through numerical simulations. This construction integrates multifractal concepts into point process theory, enabling analysis of nonlinear discrete stochastic systems with nontrivial scaling properties.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit and large deviations for run-and-tumble particles with mean-field switching rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study run-and-tumble particles moving on two copies of the discrete torus (referred to as layers), where the switching rate between layers depends on a mean-field interaction among the particles. We derive the hydrodynamic limit of this model, as well as the large deviations from the hydrodynamic limit. Our main tool is the introduction of a weakly perturbed version of the system, whose hydrodynamic equations precisely characterize the trajectories associated with large deviations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry of concentration and scaling for self-bounding functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove generalised concentration inequalities for a class of scaled self-bounding functions of independent random variables, referred to as ${(M,a,b)}$ self-bounding. The scaling refers to the fact that the component-wise difference is upper bounded by an arbitrary positive real number $M$ instead of the case $M=1$ previously considered in the literature. Using the entropy method, we derive symmetric bounds for both the upper and lower tails, and study the tightness of the proposed bounds. Our results improve existing bounds for functions that satisfy the ($a,b$) self-bounding property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a model of age-structured ecological populations in continuous interaction with a community of harvesters. We propose an individual-based model for this feedback interactions and prove its convergence to a system of coupled stochastic differential equations. This limit process is complemented with socio-ecological and environmental factors.
  For the resulting system we establish well-posedness, positivity, and the non-attainability of extinction boundaries, together with its long-term behavior and numerical approximation, relying on ad-hoc arguments to handle the super-linear growth and non-Lipschitz coefficients. Finally, we illustrate some of our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exponential anticoncentration of the permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a random matrix with independent entries, and suppose that the entries are "uniformly anticoncentrated" in the sense that there is a constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that each entry $a_{ij}$ satisfies $\sup_{z}\Pr[a_{ij}=z]\le1-\varepsilon$ (for example, $A$ could be a uniformly random $n\times n$ matrix with $\pm1$ entries). Significantly improving previous bounds of Tao and Vu, we prove that the permanent of $A$ is exponentially anticoncentrated: there is $c_{\varepsilon}&gt;0$ such that $\sup_{z}\Pr[\operatorname{per}(A)=z]\le\exp(-c_{\varepsilon}n)$. Our proof also works for the determinant, giving an alternative proof of a classical theorem of Kahn, Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi. As a consequence, we see that there are at least exponentially many different permanents of $n\times n$ matrices with $\pm1$ entries, resolving a problem of Ingram and Razborov.</description>

      <title>Discovering and Analyzing Stochastic Processes to Reduce Waste in Food Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and product shortages.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of some popular adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods in the small learning rate regime. Using the stochastic modified equations framework introduced by Li et al., we derive effective continuous stochastic dynamics for these methods. Our key contribution is that sampling-induced noise in SGD manifests in the limit as independent Brownian motions driving the parameter and gradient second momentum evolutions. Furthermore, extending the approach of Malladi et al., we investigate scaling rules between the learning rate and key hyperparameters in adaptive methods, characterising all non-trivial limiting dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal non-commutative analogues of the classical Law of Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for both martingales and sequences of independent (non-commutative) random variables. The classical martingale version was established by Stout [Sto70b] and the independent case by Hartman-Wintner [HW41]. Our approach relies on a key exponential inequality essentially due to Randrianantoanina [Ran24] that improves that from Junge and Zeng [JZ15]. It allows to derive an optimal non-commutative Stout-type LIL just as in [Zen15], from that martingale result we then deduce a non-commutative Hartman-Wintner type LIL for independent sequences of random variables.</description>

      <title>A dynamical formulation of multi-marginal optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a primal-dual dynamical formulation of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem for (semi-)convex cost functions. Even in the two-marginal setting, this formulation applies to cost functions not covered by the classical dynamical approach of Benamou-Brenier. Our dynamical formulation yields a convex optimization problem, enabling the use of convex optimization tools to find quasi-Monge solutions of the static multi-marginal problem for translation-invariant costs. We illustrate our results numerically with proximal splitting methods.</description>

      <title>Weakly self-avoiding walk in a pareto-distributed random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a model of continuous-time simple random walk paths in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ undergoing two competing interactions: an attractive one towards the large values of a random potential, and a self-repellent one in the spirit of the well-known weakly self-avoiding random walk. We take the potential to be i.i.d.~Pareto-distributed with parameter $\alpha&gt;d$, and we tune the strength of the interactions in such a way that they both contribute on the same scale as $t\to\infty$.
  Our main results are (1) the identification of the logarithmic asymptotics of the partition function of the model in terms of a random variational formula, and, (2) the identification of the path behaviour that gives the overwhelming contribution to the partition function for $\alpha&gt;2d$: the random-walk path follows an optimal trajectory that visits each of a finite number of random lattice sites for a positive random fraction of time. We prove a law of large numbers for this behaviour, i.e., that all other path behaviours give strictly less contribution to the partition function. The joint distribution of the variational problem and of the optimal path can be expressed in terms of a limiting Poisson point process arising by a rescaling of the random potential. The latter convergence is in distribution and is in the spirit of a standard extreme-value setting for a rescaling of an i.i.d. potential in large boxes, like in \cite{KLMS09}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Potts model on a graph can be approximated by a sequence of independent and identically distributed spins in terms of Wasserstein distance at high temperatures. We prove a similar result for the Curie--Weiss--Potts model on the complete graph, conditioned on being close enough to any of its equilibrium macrostates, in the low-temperature regime. Our proof technique is based on Stein's method for comparing the stationary distributions of two Glauber dynamics with similar updates, one of which is rapid mixing and contracting on a subset of the state space. Along the way, we prove a new upper bound on the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics for the conditional measure of the Curie--Weiss--Potts model near an equilibrium macrostate.</description>

Abstract: We consider a Markov chain on invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ which moves by picking an ordered pair of distinct rows and add the first one to the other, modulo $2$. We establish a logarithmic Sobolev inequality with constant $n^2$, which yields an upper bound of $O(n^2\log n)$ on the mixing time.</description>

      <title>Estimating the entanglement of random multipartite quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement of a given multipartite pure quantum state can be quantified through its geometric measure of entanglement, which, up to logarithms, is simply the maximum overlap of the corresponding unit tensor with product unit tensors, a quantity that is also known as the injective norm of the tensor. Our general goal in this work is to estimate this injective norm of randomly sampled tensors. To this end, we study and compare various algorithms, based either on the widely used alternating least squares method or on a novel normalized gradient descent approach, and suited to either symmetrized or non-symmetrized random tensors. We first benchmark their respective performances on the case of symmetrized real Gaussian tensors, whose asymptotic average injective norm is known analytically. Having established that our proposed normalized gradient descent algorithm generally performs best, we then use it to obtain numerical estimates for the average injective norm of complex Gaussian tensors (i.e., up to normalization, uniformly distributed multipartite pure quantum states), with or without permutation-invariance. We also estimate the average injective norm of random matrix product states constructed from Gaussian local tensors, with or without translation-invariance. All these results constitute the first numerical estimates on the amount of genuinely multipartite entanglement typically present in various models of random multipartite pure states. Finally, motivated by our numerical results, we posit two conjectures on the injective norms of random Gaussian tensors (real and complex) and Gaussian MPS in the asymptotic limit of the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>The space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information geometry of Markov chains has been studied using the dually flat structure of the space of transition probabilities. Although applications of this structure have been investigated, few attempts have examined its statistical meaning. In this paper, we construct a foundation for investigating the statistical meaning based on Amari's theory of positive measures. For the space of discrete distributions, Amari has introduced the space of positive measures by removing the constraint condition and investigated the extended space by finding the Bregman and $F$-divergence suitably. According to this, we introduce an extension of the space of transition probabilities equipped with suitable $F$-divergence for a given Markov chain. We regard it as the space of positive transition measures on a Markov chain, and study its dually flat structure. This provides new insight into the geometry of Markov chains and may lead to the development of the theory of Markov embeddings.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Allocation with Average Budget Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11425v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online resource allocation with average budget constraints. At each time point the decision maker makes an irrevocable decision of whether to accept or reject a request before the next request arrives with the goal to maximize the cumulative rewards. In contrast to existing literature requiring the total resource consumption is below a certain level, we require the average resource consumption per accepted request does not exceed a given threshold. This problem can be casted as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment, and can find applications in various fields such as online anomaly detection, sequential advertising, and per-capita public service providers. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such a regret growing rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data of New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \asymp 1, $$ where the implied constants are absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a 2002 conjecture of Arratia arXiv:1305.0941 who constructed a coupling for which the left-hand side in the above estimate is $\ll \log\!\log x$, and who also proved that the left-hand side is $\ge 1-o(1)$ for all couplings. In addition, we use our refined coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Verbose Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The persistence diagram is a central object in the study of persistent homology and has also been investigated in the context of random topology. The more recent notion of the verbose diagram (a.k.a. verbose barcode) is a refinement of the persistence diagram. Whereas the persistence diagram is a complete invariant of persistent homology, the verbose persistence diagram is a complete invariant of the one-level higher object -- a filtered chain complex. It therefore strictly contains the persistence diagram, both in form and in the amount of information it encodes. Concretely, the verbose diagram incorporates ephemeral features that arise in a filtered topological space, representing them as additional points along the diagonal.
  In this work, we initiate the study of random verbose diagrams. We establish a strong law of large numbers for verbose diagrams as a random point cloud grows in size -- that is, we prove the existence of a limiting verbose diagram, viewed as a measure on the half-plane on and above the diagonal. Also, we characterize its support and compute its total mass. Along the way, we extend the notion of the persistent Betti number, reveal the relation between this extended notion and the verbose diagram (which is an extension of the fundamental lemma of persistent homology), and establish results on the asymptotic behavior of the extended persistent Betti numbers.
  This work extends the main results of the work by Hiraoka, Shirai, and Trinh and its sequel by Shirai and Suzaki to the setting of verbose diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Monte Carlo simulation method (MinMC) that approximates prices and risk measures for a range $\Gamma$ of model parameters at once. The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}[X]$, where $\theta$ denotes the model and $\mathbb{E}_{\theta}$ the expectation with respect to the distribution $P_\theta$ of the model $\theta$, can be obtained across all $\theta \in \Gamma$ by minimizing a map $V:H\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $H$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of $\theta$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.</description>

Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the intersection covolume of cross sections for probability preserving actions of a class of abelian groups without lattices, including $p$-adic groups and the group of finite adeles. We show that for cross sections with a uniformly discrete return time set, the intersection covolume is bounded below by twice the intensity, revealing a strict gap compared to the lattice case. Our main theorem asserts that cut-and-project systems uniquely attain the minimal intersection covolume. As an application, we characterize the generalized Farey fractions in the finite adeles via their Banach density.</description>
