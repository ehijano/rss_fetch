      <title>Optical computing using telecom device platform for nonlinear mapping to high-dimensional feature space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping input signals to a high-dimensional space is a critical concept in various computing paradigms. We propose using commercially available telecom devices developed for high-speed optical data transmission for computing through nonlinear mapping of optical signals into a high-dimensional space where linear processing can be applied. We manipulate the output feature dimension by applying temporal up-sampling (at the speed of commercially available telecom devices) of input signals and a well-established wave-division-multiplexing (WDM). This gives remarkable flexibility in the {\it dynamical phase masking} of the input signal. We demonstrate the general concept employing readily available photonic devices, including a semiconductor optical amplifier and nonlinear optical loop mirror (equivalent nonlinear Mach-Zender interferometer). We apply linear regression on the high-dimensional output states to solve forecasting and classification problems. We investigate how nonlinear mapping provided by these devices can be characterized in terms of the increased controlled separability and predictability of the output state.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mode-Locked Single-Cavity Dual-Comb Laser Utilizing Time-Stretch Dispersive Fourier Transform Spectroscopy with Supplemental File</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As dual combs play a significant role in numerous high-precision measurements, their efficient generation has been widely researched. Although the single-cavity dual-comb generation can avoid the complex active stabilization methods, achieving and maintaining stable dual-comb mode locking within a single cavity remains a critical challenge. To break through this constraint, a two-part evaluation criterion containing a fitness function and a CNN-Transformer network is employed to achieve mode locking and classify the dual-comb mode-locked state. Simulated time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) spectra are used as datasets, which simplifies the optimization process and does not rely on specific experimental data. A developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) for paddle-based motorized polarization controllers (MPCs) is proposed, enabling the intelligent attainment of dual-comb mode-locked states. A real-time library stores fitness and MPC angles, facilitating mode-locked state achievement within 2 seconds. Finally, long term running of dual-comb mode locking is ensured by a random collision algorithm utilizing an evaluation criterion of weak soliton peaks.</description>

      <title>Long-distance high-precision and high-sensitivity time delay sensing based on fiber optic weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fiber optic sensing, time delays induced by polarization mode dispersion can distort signals in systems relying on phase or intensity variations for measurement, degrading performance, especially in long distance, high-precision applications. To address this challenge, we propose a weak measurement-based scheme using intensity contrast ratio for high-precision, high-sensitivity fiber optic delay estimation under large inherent time delays. We demonstrate that a narrower light source bandwidth enhances the effective sensing distance for high-sensitivity measurements. Our results show that, even with large inherent time delays, the measurement precision and sensitivity remain comparable to those of biased weak measurement, enabling detection of time delay variations at the attosecond level, corresponding to a 25.5 Pa water pressure change. The scheme is also robust against fiber misalignment errors, offering a novel solution for long-distance distributed fiber-optic sensing and broadening the applications of weak measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Simple THz phase retarder based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer for polarization control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand polarization control of electromagnetic waves is the fundamental element of modern optics. Its interest has recently been expanded in the terahertz (THz) range for coherent excitation of collective quasiparticles in matters, triggering a wide variety of non-trivial intriguing physics, e.g., anharmonicity, nonlinear coupling, and metastability. Wavelength tunability in THz polarization control is fundamentally important for the resonant excitation of collective modes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a simple and convenient THz phase retarder based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer to obtain circular polarization. The efficiency of THz polarization conversion is demonstrated by the achieved high polarization degree of more than 99.9% and a large transmission of ~76%. The simple and compact setup allows us to adapt the phase retarder to existing setups readily and will contribute to further exploration of ultrafast science, e.g., chiral phononics.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps &gt; 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</description>

      <title>Thermally Adaptive Surface Microscopy for brain functional imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopes can record the dynamics of living cells with high spatio-temporal resolution in a single plane. However, monitoring rapid and dim fluorescence fluctuations, e.g induced by neuronal activity in the brain, remains challenging for 3D-distributed emitters due to out-of-focus fluorescence background, a restricted photon budget, and the speed limit of conventional scanning systems. Here, we introduce a Thermally Adaptive Surface strategy, capable of simultaneously recording, at camera framerate, the activity of 3D-distributed objects. This innovative microscope leverages on an array of thermally tuneable microlenses that offer low chromatic aberration and high transmission, and can be combined with patterned illumination to provide optical sectioning. We demonstrate its potential in vivo, by simultaneously monitoring fast fluorescent dynamics at different depths in the zebrafish larval brain, at a rate of 0.5 kHz and over a large field of view (360um x 360um).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formula for the spectral distribution of intensity of radiation from a system of gap-separated undulators is derived. Due to the constructive addition of radiation fields formed in undulators, the line shape of the spontaneous radiation at zero angle is narrowed. According to Madey's theory, the gain is proportional to the derivative of the line shape of the spontaneous radiation, hence, it is enhanced.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Quantum Polarization Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on the quantum principles has been proposed over traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from coincidence count. While, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, though the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within narrow range of analyzer angle. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>On Large-Space and Long-Time Asymptotic Behaviors of Kink-Soliton Gases in the Sine-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the large-space and long-time asymptotics of kink-soliton gases in the sine-Gordon (sG) equation, addressing an important open problem highlighted in the recent work [Phys. Rev. E 109 (2024) 061001]. We focus on kink-soliton gases modeled within a Riemann-Hilbert framework and characterized by two types of generalized reflection coefficients, each defined on the interval $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$: $r_0(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} |\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0} \gamma(\lambda)$ and $r_c(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} \chi_c(\lambda) \gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$, \(\gamma(\lambda)\) is a continuous, strictly positive function defined on $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$. The function \(\chi_c(\lambda)\) demonstrates a step-like behavior: it is given by \(\chi_c(\lambda) = 1\) for \(\lambda \in [\eta_1, \eta_0)\) and \(\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2\) for \(\lambda \in (\eta_0, \eta_2]\), with \(c\) as a positive constant distinct from one. To rigorously derive the asymptotic results, we leverage the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. A central component of this approach is constructing an appropriate \(g\)-function for the conjugation process. Unlike in the KdV equation, the sG presents unique challenges for \(g\)-function formulation, particularly concerning the singularity at the origin. The Riemann-Hilbert problem also requires carefully constructed local parametrices near endpoints \(\eta_j\) and the singularity \(\eta_0\). At the endpoints \(\eta_j\), we employ a modified Bessel parametrix of the first kind. For the singularity \(\eta_0\), the parametrix selection depends on the reflection coefficient: the second kind of modified Bessel parametrix is used for \(r_0(\lambda)\), while a confluent hypergeometric parametrix is applied for \(r_c(\lambda)\).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</description>

      <title>A Value Mapping Virtual Staining Framework for Large-scale Histological Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of virtual staining technology provides a rapid and efficient alternative for researchers in tissue pathology. It enables the utilization of unlabeled microscopic samples to generate virtual replicas of chemically stained histological slices, or facilitate the transformation of one staining type into another. The remarkable performance of generative networks, such as CycleGAN, offers an unsupervised learning approach for virtual coloring, overcoming the limitations of high-quality paired data required in supervised learning. Nevertheless, large-scale color transformation necessitates processing large field-of-view images in patches, often resulting in significant boundary inconsistency and artifacts. Additionally, the transformation between different colorized modalities typically needs further efforts to modify loss functions and tune hyperparameters for independent training of networks. In this study, we introduce a general virtual staining framework that is adaptable to various conditions. We propose a loss function based on the value mapping constraint to ensure the accuracy of virtual coloring between different pathological modalities, termed the Value Mapping Generative Adversarial Network (VM-GAN). Meanwhile, we present a confidence-based tiling method to address the challenge of boundary inconsistency arising from patch-wise processing. Experimental results on diverse data with varying staining protocols demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative indicators and improved visual perception.</description>

Abstract: Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional reconstructions of capillary flows and objects using Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental technique to characterize the free surface of capillary flows adapted from the Spatio-Temporal Phase Shifting Profilometry (ST-PSP) method introduced by Ri et al. (Journal of Optics, 2019) for solid bodies. The present study is focused on various regimes of capillary flows over inclined surfaces, including drops, rivulets, meanders, and braided films. A calibration process is carried out using a solid wedge to determine the optical distances required for the phase-to-height relationship. The optimal dye concentration necessary for accurately reconstructing the free surface of a dyed water flow is explored. The ST-PSP method is then applied to profile different liquid flows and objects, achieving large signal-to-noise ratios across all experiments. Notably, the analysis of a sessile droplet shows a promising correlation between the ST-PSP results and side-view visualizations, as evidenced by the accurate recovery of its apparent contact angle. Furthermore, free surface reconstructions of rivulet flows exhibit good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Duffy and Moffatt (The Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal, 1995). These results suggest that the ST-PSP method is highly effective for obtaining accurate height maps of capillary flows and objects, making it a valuable tool for validating theoretical models in the future.</description>

      <title>The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes</title>

Abstract: Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transparent conducting oxides are highly doped semiconductors that exhibit favourable characteristics when compared to metals, including reduced material losses, tuneable electronic and optical properties, and enhanced damage thresholds. Recently, the photonic community has renewed its attention towards these materials, recognizing their remarkable nonlinear optical properties in the near-infrared spectrum, a feature previously overlooked despite their long-standing application in photovoltaics and touchscreens. The exceptionally large and ultra-fast change of the refractive index, which can be optically induced in these compounds, extends beyond the boundaries of conventional perturbative analysis and makes this class of materials the closest approximation to a time-varying system, and a unique playground for studying a variety of novel phenomena within the domain of photon acceleration. Here we report the spatio-spectral fission of an ultra-fast pulse trespassing a thin film of aluminium zinc oxide with a non-stationary refractive index. By applying phase conservation to this time-varying layer, our model can account for both space and time refraction and explain in quantitative terms, the spatial separation of both the spectrum and energy. Our findings represent an example of extreme nonlinear phenomena on subwavelength propagation distances and shed light on the nature of several nonlinear effects recently reported not accounting for the full optical field distribution. Our work also provides new important insights into transparent conducting oxides transient optical properties which are critical for the ongoing research in photonic time crystals, on-chip generation of nonclassical states of light, integrated optical neural networks as well as ultra-fast beam steering and frequency division multiplexing</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems offer significant advantages in sensor design, especially at the exceptional points. However, the extreme sensitivity near these points poses great challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we establish a direct relation between the incident polarization and the transmission phase of a coupled metasurface system and achieve the polarization-controlled phase singularity even post-fabrication. The incident polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

Abstract: Experimentally measured characteristics of a kHz laser-driven Cu plasma X-ray source that was recently commissioned at ELI Beamlines facility are reported. The source can be driven either by an in-house developed high contrast sub-20 fs near-infrared TW laser based on optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification technology, or by a more conventional Ti:sapphire laser delivering 12 mJ, 45 fs pulses. The X-ray source parameters obtained with the two driving lasers are compared. Measured photon flux of the order up to 10^{12} K{\alpha} photons/4{\pi}/s is reported. Furthermore, experimental platforms for ultrafast X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption and/or emission spectroscopy based on the reported source are described.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Frequency Combs and Pulse Generation based on Single Section Interband Cascade Lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inelastic interaction between coherent light with constant frequency and free electrons enables periodic phase modulation of electron wave packets leading to periodic side-bands in the electron energy spectra. In this Letter we propose a generalization of the interaction by considering linearly chirped electron wave packets interacting with chirped optical fields. We theoretically demonstrate that when matching the chirp parameters of the electron and light waves, the interaction leads to partial monochromatization of the electron spectra in one of the energy side-bands. Depending on the coherence time of the electrons, the electron spectrum may be narrowed down by a factor of 5-times with 26% of the electron distribution in the monochromatized energy band. This approach will improve the spectral resolution and reduce color aberrations in ultrafast imaging experiments with free electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme allowing to reach noncollinear phase-matching of high harmonic generation in solids, which may potentially lead to an enhancement of the generation efficiency. The principle is based on high-order frequency mixing of two light waves with identical frequencies but different directions of wavevectors. In this process, $N$-th harmonic frequency is produced by frequency mixing of $N$+1 photons from a wave with high amplitude of electric field and a single photon from a wave with low field amplitude, which are propagating noncollinearly in an optically isotropic media. We experimentally verify the feasibility of this scheme by demonstrating phase-matched generation of third and fifth harmonic frequency in sapphire.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.</description>

Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently emerged as a promising method for generating non-classical states of light with frequencies spanning from the infrared up to the extreme ultraviolet regime. In this work, we theoretically investigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in atomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our study reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and low-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing features in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes, and among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we demonstrate the generation of optical Schr\"odinger kitten states through heralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes influenced by two-mode squeezing.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that these non-classical features prompt the HHG process, with the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics depending on the type of squeezing applied. We examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.</description>
