      <title>Twisted Bilayer Graphene in Commensurate Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ``magic angles" in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has spurred extensive research into its electronic properties. The primary tool for studying this thus far has been the famous Bistritzer-MacDonald model, which relies on several approximations. This work aims to build the first steps in studying magic angles without using this model. Thus, we study a model for TBG in AA stacking \emph{without} the approximations mentioned above in the continuum setting, using two copies of a potential with the symmetries of graphene, sharing a common origin and twisted with respect to each other. We describe the angles for which the two twisted lattices are commensurate and prove the existence of Dirac cones in the vertices of the Brillouin zone for such angles. Furthermore, we show that for small potentials, the slope of the Dirac cones is small for commensurate angles that are close to incommensurate angles. This work is the first to establish the existence of Dirac cones for twisted bilayer graphene in the continuum setting without relying on the above model. This work is the first in a series of works to build a more fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of magic angles.</description>

      <title>On the Hilbert Space of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model, Deformed Double Current Algebra Action, and the Conformal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons matrix model was proposed by Dorey, Tong, and Turner to describe non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall effect. In this paper we study the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model from a geometric quantization point of view. We show that the Hilbert space of the Chern-Simons matrix model can be identified with the space of sections of a line bundle on the quiver variety associated to a framed Jordan quiver. We compute the character of the Hilbert space using localization technique. Using a natural isomorphism between vortex moduli space and a Beilinson-Drinfeld Schubert variety, we prove that the ground states wave functions are flat sections of a bundle of conformal blocks associated to a WZW model. In particular they solve a Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. We show that there exists a natural action of the deformed double current algebra (DDCA) on the Hilbert space, moreover the action is irreducible.
  We define and study the conformal limit of the Chern-Simons matrix model. We show that the conformal limit of the Hilbert space is an irreducible integrable module of $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ with level identified with the matrix model level. Moreover, we prove that $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ generators can be obtained from scaling limits of matrix model operators, which settles a conjecture of Dorey-Tong-Turner. The key to the proof is the construction of a Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the conformal limit of the Hilbert space, which we expect to be equivalent to the $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ action on the integrable $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n)$ modules constructed by Uglov. We also characterize eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix model Hilbert space with respect to a maximal commutative subalgebra of Yangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burgers--KdV hierarchy was introduced towards understanding intersection numbers on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with boundaries. The goal of this paper is to derive the Dubrovin--Zhang type loop equation for the topological tau-function of the Burgers--KdV hierarchy. As as application, we provide some relations for open intersection numbers.</description>

      <title>Symplectic fermions in general domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we construct a logarithmic conformal field theory in general domains of the complex plane. The theory of interest is the symplectic fermions because of its links to models of statistical mechanics. We provide an explicit construction of its space of fields as a logarithmic Fock space, and discuss its logarithmic structure as a representation of the Virasoro algebra at $c=-2$. The correlation functions of the theory are explicitly constructed following the ideas of the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>On the alternatives to the ideal mathematical points-like separatedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10253v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper as an alternative to models based on the notion of ideal mathematical point, characterized by a property of separatedness, we considered a viewpoint based on the notion of continuous change, making use of elements of a non-classical logic, in particular the fuzzy sets theory, with events represented as spatiotemporally blurred blobs. Here we point out and discuss a number of aspects of this imperfect symbolic description that might potentially be misleading. Besides that, we analyze its relation to various concepts used commonly to model physical systems, denoted by terms like: point, set, continuous, discrete, infinite, or local, clarifying further how our viewpoint is different and asking whether, in light of our main postulate, any of these notions, or their opposites, if exist, are in their usual meanings suitable to accurately describe the natural phenomena.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Quantum Contextual Topos: Integrating Modality and Topos Theory in Quantum Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Quantum Contextual Topos (QCT), a novel framework that extends traditional quantum logic by embedding contextual elements within a topos-theoretic structure. This framework seeks to provide a classically-obedient tool for exploring the logical foundations of quantum mechanics. The QCT framework aims to address the limitations of classical quantum logic, particularly its challenges in capturing the dynamic and contextual nature of quantum phenomena. By integrating modal operators and classical propositional logic within a topos structure, the QCT offers a unified approach to modeling quantum systems. The main result of this work is demonstrating that the internal logic of QCT corresponds to a form of classical propositional polymodal logic. We do this by generalizing Stone's Representation Theorem for a specific case of polymodal algebras and their underlying Stone Spaces.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics is a promising candidate for obtaining a quantum computational advantage. However, linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some computations require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. We obtain the invariants by projecting the density operator of the state onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. The conservation of the invariants gives necessary conditions for exact and approximate state preparation with passive linear optics: if input and output states have different invariants, it will be impossible to design a linear optical experiment that evolves one into the other or a sufficiently close one. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare entangled states useful for quantum information, like Bell or NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to take into account the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <title>The Virasoro Completeness Relation and Inverse Shapovalov Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an explicit expression for the inverse of the symmetric bilinear form of Virasoro Verma modules, the so-called Shapovalov form, in terms of singular vector operators and their conformal dimensions. Our proposed expression also determines the resolution of the identity for Verma modules of the Virasoro algebra, and can be thus employed in the computation of Virasoro conformal blocks via the sewing procedure.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Broadcast Structures from von Neumann type interaction Hamiltonians with continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS and asymptotic convergence to SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We will be focusing on the case where the system is modeled by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the operators associated with the system in the Hamiltonian have purely continuous spectrum. Such a setup yields mathematical complications that have hitherto not been addressed in the theory of SBS.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of 3D Out-flowing Compressible Viscous Fluid under Non-Spherical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an outflow problem for the $3$-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^3\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and it is flowing out from $\Omega$ at a constant speed $|u_b|$, in the normal direction to the boundary surface $\partial\Omega$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, and $|u_b|$ is sufficiently small, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(x)$. In this paper, we prove that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(x)$ is asymptotically stable in time, under small, possibly non-spherically symmetric initial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Any Quantum Many-Body State under Local Dissipation will be Disentangled in Finite Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any quantum many-spin state under genetic local dissipation will be fully separable after a finite time independent of the system size. Such a sudden death of many-body entanglement occurs universally provided that there is a finite damping gap and the unique steady-state density matrix is of full rank. This result is rigorously derived by combining a state-reconstruction identity based on random measurements and the convergence bound for quantum channels. Related works and possible generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Dunkl-Schrodinger Equation in Higher Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents analytical solutions for eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions, incorporating the Dunkl operator. Two fundamental quantum mechanical problems are examined in their exact forms: the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. In order to obtain analytical solutions to these problems, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems were employed. Firstly, the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation is derived in d-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, and then for the isotropic harmonic potential interaction, its solutions are given. Subsequently, using polar coordinates the angular and radial parts of the Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation are obtained. It is demonstrated that the system permits the separation of variables in both coordinate systems, with the resulting separated solutions expressed through Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Then, the radial Dunkl-Schr\"odinger equation is solved using the isotropic harmonic, pseudoharmonic, and Coulomb potentials. The eigenstates and eigenvalues are obtained for each case and the behavior of the energy eigenvalue functions are illustrated graphically with the reduced probability densities.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for fully coupled stochastic fluid dynamics across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates variational frameworks for modeling stochastic dynamics in incompressible fluids, focusing on large-scale fluid behavior alongside small-scale stochastic processes. The authors aim to develop a coupled system of equations that captures both scales, using a variational principle formulated with Lagrangians defined on the full flow, and incorporating stochastic transport constraints. The approach smooths the noise term along time, leading to stochastic dynamics as a regularization parameter approaches zero. Initially, fixed noise terms are considered, resulting in a generalized stochastic Euler equation, which becomes problematic as the regularization parameter diminishes. The study then examines connections with existing stochastic frameworks and proposes a new variational principle that couples noise dynamics with large-scale fluid motion. This comprehensive framework provides a stochastic representation of large-scale dynamics while accounting for fine-scale components. The evolution of the small-scale velocity component is governed by a linear Euler equation with random coefficients, influenced by large-scale transport, stretching, and pressure forcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we replace the standard partial derivatives in the Klein-Gordon equation with Dunkl derivatives and obtain exact analytical solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation in higher dimensions. We apply this formalism to two key quantum mechanical systems: the d-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the Coulomb potential. First, we introduce Dunkl quantum mechanics in d-dimensional polar coordinates, followed by an analysis of the d-dimensional Dunkl-Klein-Gordon oscillator. Subsequently, we derive the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions, which are expressed using confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the Dunkl formalism on both the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the second case, we explore both the bound-state solutions and scattering scenarios of the Dunkl-Klein-Gordon equation with the Coulomb potential. The bound-state solutions are represented in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, while the scattering states enable us to compute the particle creation density and probability using the Bogoliubov transformation method.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>The number of minima in random landscapes generated by constrained random walk and L\'evy flights: universal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a uniform framework to compute the exact distribution of the number of minima/maxima in three different random walk landscape models in one dimension. The landscape is generated by the trajectory of a discrete-time continuous space random walk with arbitrary symmetric and continuous jump distribution at each step. In model I, we consider a ``free'' random walk of $N$ steps. In model II, we consider a ``meander landscape'' where the random walk, starting at the origin, stays non-negative up to $N$ steps. In model III, we study a ``first-passage landscape'' which is generated by the trajectory of a random walk that starts at the origin and stops when it crosses the origin for the first time. We demonstrate that while the exact distribution of the number of minima is different in the three models, for each model it is universal for all $N$, in the sense that it does not depend on the jump distribution as long as it is symmetric and continuous. In the last two cases we show that this universality follows from a non trivial mapping to the Sparre Andersen theorem known for the first-passage probability of discrete-time random walks with symmetric and continuous jump distribution. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with our numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Isomonodromic and isospectral deformations of meromorphic connections: the $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-twisted meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ and the associated symplectic Hamiltonian structure. In particular, we provide explicit expressions of the Lax pair in the geometric gauge supplementing previous results where explicit formulas have been obtained in the oper gauge. Expressing the geometric Lax matrices requires the introduction of specific Darboux coordinates for which we provide the explicit Hamiltonian evolutions. These expressions allow to build bridges between the isomonodromic deformations and the isospectral ones. More specifically, we propose an explicit change of Darboux coordinates to obtain isospectral coordinates for which Hamiltonians match the spectral invariants. This result solves the issue left opened in \cite{BertolaHarnadHurtubise2022} in the case of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Disjointness of inertial KMS states and the role of Lorentz symmetry in thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint, i.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary, have separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike cluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by the inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus showing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial frame is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We review the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems theory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior of detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue that the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant velocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot thermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the physical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged "heat bath" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and RTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest frame of the detector.</description>

      <title>The ground state energy is not always convex in the number of electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first counter-example showing that the ground state energy of electrons in an external Coulomb potential is not always a convex function of the number of electrons. This property had been conjectured to hold for decades and it plays an important role in quantum chemistry. Our counter-example involves an external potential generated by six nuclei of small fractional charges, placed far away from each other. The ground state energy of 3 electrons is proved to be higher than the average of the energies for 2 and 4 electrons. In addition, we show that the nuclei can bind 2 or 4 electrons, but not 3. Although the conjecture remains open for real nuclei (of integer charges), our work sets some doubt on the validity of the energy convexity for general atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Instantons and transseries of the Mathieu potential deformed by a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative effects of a deformation of the Mathieu differential equation consistent with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. First, we develop a connection between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian scenarios by a reparameterization in the complex plane, followed by a restriction of the $\mathcal{PT}$ deformation parameter. The latter is responsible for preserving the information about $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry when we choose to work in the Hermitian scenario. We note that this factor is present in all non-perturbative results and in the transseries representation of the deformed Mathieu partition function that we have obtained. In quantum mechanics, we found that the deformation parameter of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has an effect on the real instanton solution for the deformed Mathieu potential in the Hermitian scenario. As its value increases, the non-Hermiticity factor makes it smoother for the instanton to pass from one minimum to another, that is, it modifies the instanton width. The explanation for this lies in the fact that the height of the potential barrier decreases as we increase the value of the deformation parameter. We present how this effect extends to the multi-instanton level and to the bounce limit of an instanton-anti-instanton pair. As an application of the obtained results, we show that the equation of motion under a tilted version of the potential in the Hermitian scenario compares to the resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model for the Josephson junction.</description>

Abstract: We propose a geometric realization of the Feigin-Loktev fusion product of graded cyclic modules over the current algebra. This allows us to compute it in several new cases. We also relate the Feigin-Loktev fusion product to the convolution of perverse coherent sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of the adjoint group. This relation allows us to establish the existence of exact triples, conjecturally corresponding to cluster relations in the Grothendieck ring of coherent Satake category.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) capability, two properties of fundamental importance to the physics and practical use of quantum many-body systems, covering systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems in finite spatial dimensions. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding $k$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial "phases" of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant "scaling threshold" of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <title>Useful variants and perturbations of completely entangled subspaces and spans of unextendible product bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite dimensional entanglement for pure states has been used extensively in quantum information theory. Depending on the tensor product structure, even set of separable states can show non-intuitive characters. Two situations are well studied in the literature, namely the unextendible product basis by Bennett et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5385, (1999)], and completely entangled subspaces explicitly given by Parthasarathy in [Proc. Indian Acad. Sci. Math. Sci. 114, 4 (2004)]. More recently, Boyer, Liss, and Mor [Phys. Rev. A 95, 032308 (2017)]; Boyer and Mor [Preprints 2023080529, (2023)]; and Liss, Mor, and Winter [Lett. Math. Phys, 114, 86 (2024)] have studied spaces which have only finitely many pure product states. We carry this further and consider the problem of perturbing different spaces, such as the orthogonal complement of an unextendible product basis and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled spaces, by taking linear spans with specified product vectors. To this end, we develop methods and theory of variations and perturbations of the linear spans of certain unextendible product bases, their orthogonal complements, and also Parthasarathy's completely entangled sub-spaces. Finally, we give examples of perturbations with infinitely many pure product states.</description>

      <title>Flux-balance laws for spinning bodies under the gravitational self-force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of an extended, but still weakly gravitating body in general relativity can often be determined by a set of conserved quantities. Much like for geodesic motion, a sufficient number of conserved quantities allows the motion to be solved by quadrature. Under the gravitational self-force (relaxing the "weakly gravitating" assumption), the motion can then be described in terms of the evolution these "conserved quantities". This evolution can be calculated using the (local) self-force on the body, but such an approach is computationally intensive. To avoid this, one often uses flux-balance laws: relationships between the average evolution (capturing the dissipative dynamics) and the values of the field far away from the body, which are far easier to compute. In the absence of spin, such a flux-balance law has been proven in [Isoyama et al., 2019] for any of the conserved action variables appearing in a Hamiltonian formulation of geodesic motion in the Kerr spacetime. In this paper, we derive a corresponding flux-balance law, to linear order in spin, directly relating average rates of change to the flux of a conserved current through the horizon and out to infinity. In the absence of spin, this reproduces results consistent with those in [Isoyama et al., 2019]. To linear order in spin, we derive flux-balance laws for four of the five constants for spinning bodies in the Kerr spacetime, in particular a novel flux-balance law for the (generalized) Carter constant.</description>

Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

Abstract: Current fluctuations for the one-dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) connected to reservoirs of particles, and their large scale limit to the KPZ fixed point in finite volume, are studied using exact methods. Focusing on the maximal current phase for TASEP, corresponding to infinite boundary slopes for the KPZ height field, we obtain for general initial condition an exact expression for the late time correction to stationarity, involving extreme value statistics of Brownian paths. In the special cases of stationary and narrow wedge initial conditions, a combination of Bethe ansatz and numerical conjectures alternatively provide fully explicit exact expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, the idea of finite dimensional $L^p$ spaces is transferred to Lorentzian length spaces to provide an example that is locally nowhere Minkowskian. Looking at the sectional curvature bounds of this example leads to the more general statement that normed spaces in which the norm does not come from an inner product, have no sectional curvature bounds. This statement holds in the Riemannian and Lorentzian cases. In addition, the Lorentzian $L^p$ space can be used as an example in the context of Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, to show that unbounded sectional curvature or geodesic regularity is in general not preserved in the GH limit, and as an example of a sequence of uniform bounded length spaces which are not GH pre-compact.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quantification of entanglement with a single copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in fueling many quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. This is due to the need to precisely characterise many-copy, asymptotic protocols for entanglement processing. Here we overcome these issues by introducing a new way of benchmarking the fundamental protocol of entanglement distillation (purification), where instead of measuring its asymptotic yield, we focus on the best achievable error. We connect this formulation of the task with an information-theoretic problem in composite quantum hypothesis testing known as generalised Sanov's theorem. By solving the latter problem -- which had no previously known solution even in classical information theory -- we thus compute the optimal asymptotic error exponent of entanglement distillation. We show this asymptotic solution to be given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state, which is a unique feature among operational measures of entanglement. Altogether, we thus demonstrate a measure of entanglement that admits a direct operational interpretation as the optimal asymptotic rate of an important entanglement manipulation protocol while enjoying an exact, single-letter formula.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>
