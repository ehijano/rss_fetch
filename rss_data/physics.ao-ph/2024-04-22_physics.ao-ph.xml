      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>What can Hurricane SAM (2021) tell us about ocean waves under tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ocean wave field under Hurricane SAM (2021). Whilst measurements of waves under Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are rare, an unusually large number of quality in situ and remote measurements are available in that case. First, we highlight the good consistency between the wave spectra provided by the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) instrument onboard the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), the in situ spectra measured by National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, and a saildrone. The impact of strong rains on SWIM spectra is then further investigated. We show that whereas the rain definitely affects the normalized radar cross section, both the innovative technology (beam rotating scanning geometry) and the post-processing processes applied to retrieve the 2D wave spectra ensure a good quality of the resulting wave spectra, even in heavy rain conditions. On this basis, the satellite, airborne and in situ observations are confronted to the analytical model proposed by Kudryavtsev et al (2015). We show that a trapped wave mechanism may be invoked to explain the large significant wave height observed in the right front quadrant of Hurricane SAM.</description>

      <title>The environmental low-frequency background for macro-calorimeters at the millikelvin scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many of the most sensitive physics experiments searching for rare events, like neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and dark matter interactions, rely on cryogenic macro-calorimeters operating at the mK-scale. Located underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), in central Italy, CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events) is one of the leading experiments for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, implementing the low-temperature calorimetric technology. We present a novel multi-detector analysis to correlate environmental phenomena with the low-frequency noise of low-temperature calorimeters. Indeed, the correlation of marine and seismic data with data from a pair of CUORE detectors indicates that cryogenic detectors are sensitive not only to intense vibrations generated by earthquakes, but also to the much fainter vibrations induced by marine microseisms in the Mediterranean Sea due to the motion of sea waves. Proving that cryogenic macro-calorimeters are sensitive to such environmental sources of noise opens the possibility of studying their impact on the detectors physics-case sensitivity. Moreover, this study could pave the road for technology developments dedicated to the mitigation of the noise induced by marine microseisms, from which the entire community of cryogenic calorimeters can benefit.</description>

      <title>Preserving linear invariants in ensemble filtering methods</title>

Abstract: Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.</description>

      <title>Identifying Three-Dimensional Radiative Patterns Associated with Early Tropical Cyclone Intensification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud radiative feedback impacts early tropical cyclone (TC) intensification, but limitations in existing diagnostic frameworks make them unsuitable for studying asymmetric or transient radiative heating. We propose a linear Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) to learn the hidden relationship between radiation and the surface intensification of realistic simulated TCs. Limiting VED model inputs enables using its uncertainty to identify periods when radiation has more importance for intensification. A close examination of the extracted 3D radiative structures suggests that longwave radiative forcing from inner core deep convection and shallow clouds both contribute to intensification, with the deep convection having the most impact overall. We find that deep convection downwind of the shallow clouds is critical to the intensification of Haiyan. Our work demonstrates that machine learning can discover thermodynamic-kinematic relationships without relying on axisymmetric or deterministic assumptions, paving the way towards the objective discovery of processes leading to TC intensification in realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Wave-resolving Voronoi model of Rouse number for sediment entrainment equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To integrate wave and sediment transport modeling, a computationally extensive wave-resolving Voronoi mesh-based simulation has been developed to improve upon heretofore separate sediment and spectral wave modeling. Orbital wave motion-dependent sediment transport and fine structures of the dynamic Rouse number distribution across the seabed were brought into focus. The entirely parallelized wave-resolving hydrodynamic model is demonstrated for nearshore beach waters adjacent to artificial islands in Doha Bay. The nested model was validated with tidal time series for three locations and two seasons.</description>

      <title>Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to merge precipitation data over mountainous area in Sierra Nevada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale. The merged results are compared with the widely used reanalysis precipitation product, Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), and assessed against gauge observational data from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC). The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.</description>

      <title>Short-term wind speed forecasting model based on an attention-gated recurrent neural network and error correction strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate wind speed series forecast is very pivotal to security of grid dispatching and the application of wind power. Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast.</description>
