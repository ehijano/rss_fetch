      <title>Isospin kaon anomaly and its consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospin symmetry is well fulfilled in the QCD vacuum, as evidenced by small mass differences of isospin partners and suppressed isospin-violating decays. Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\Sigma^{+}/\Sigma^{-}\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions.</description>

      <title>Initial Baryon Stopping and Angular Momentum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncentral heavy-ion collisions create fireballs with large initial orbital angular momentum that is expected to induce strong vorticity in the hot bulk fluid and generate global spin polarization of the produced particles. As the collision beam energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ decreases to approach the two-nucleon-mass threshold, this initial angular momentum approaches zero. One may thus expect that the observed global spin polarization should reach a maximum and then drop to zero as increased stopping competes with decreased initial momentum. Recent experimental measurements, however, appear to show a continual rise of hyperon polarization even down to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =$ 2.42 GeV, suggesting a peak very near threshold which is difficult to interpret and calls for a better understanding of angular momentum initial conditions, especially at low energy. Here, we develop a new Glauber-based initial state model ("Glauber+") to investigate the initial distribution of angular momentum with respect to rapidity as well as the dependence of this distribution on initial baryon stopping across a wide range of collisional beam energy. We estimate that the angular momentum per produced final charged particle at mid-rapidity peaks around 5 GeV, which may present a potential challenge to an interpretation of the spin polarization measurements near threshold as being a consequence of the initial angular momentum of the colliding system.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-decay of N=126 isotones for the r-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta$-decay properties of nuclei with neutron number $N = 126$ is investigated in this paper. Two different versions of the proton-neutron quasi particle random phase (pn-QRPA) model were employed to compute $\beta$-decay rates and half-lives for the N = 126 isotones. The first set of calculation solves the pn-QRPA equations using the schematic model (SM) approach. The Woods-Saxon potential was employed as a mean-field basis. A spherical shape assigned for each waiting point nuclei throughout all simulations. Both allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions were considered in the particle-hole (ph) channel. The second set uses the pn-QRPA model in deformed Nilsson basis to calculate $\beta$-decay rates for allowed GT and unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions under terrestrial and stellar conditions. Our results are in agreement with shell model findings that first-forbidden transitions lead to a considerable decrement in the calculated half-lives of the isotones. Inclusion of the first-forbidden contribution led to a decent agreement of our computed terrestrial $\beta$-decay half-lives with measured ones, much better than the previous calculations. The possible implication of the waiting point nuclei on r-process nucleosynthesis is discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Lepton emission rates of 43-64V isotopes under stellar conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical conditions prevalent during the late times of stellar evolution, lepton ($e^-$ and $e^+$) emission processes compete with the corresponding lepton capture processes. Prior to the collapse, lepton emissions significantly affect the cooling of the core and reduce its entropy. Therefore, the lepton emission rates for Fe-group nuclei serve as an important input for core-collapse simulations of high-mass stars.
  From earlier simulation studies, isotopes of vanadium (V) have great astrophysical significance in regard to their weak-decay rates, which substantially affect $Y_e$ (fraction of lepton to baryon number) during the final developmental stages of massive stars. The current study involves the computation of the weak lepton emission (LE) rates for V isotopes by employing the improved deformed proton-neutron Quasi-particle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The mass numbers of the selected isotopes range from 43 to 64. The LE rates on these isotopes have been estimated for a broad spectrum of density and temperature under astrophysical conditions. The ranges considered for density and temperature are $10^1$ to $10^{11}$ (g/cm$^3$) and $10^7$ to $3 \times 10^{11}$ (K), respectively.
  The lepton emission rates from the present study were also compared to the rates previously estimated by using the independent-particle model (IPM) and large-scale shell model (LSSM). IPM rates are generally bigger than QRPA rates, while LSSM rates overall show a good comparison with the reported rates.</description>

      <title>Mapped interacting boson model for nuclear structure studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present status of the mapped interacting boson model studies on nuclear structure is reviewed. With the assumption that the nuclear surface deformation induced by the multi-nucleon dynamics is simulated by bosonic degrees of freedom, the interacting-boson Hamiltonian that provides energy spectra and wave functions is determined by mapping the potential energy surface that is obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations based on the energy density functional onto the corresponding energy surface of the boson system. This procedure has been shown to be valid in general cases of the quadrupole collective states, and has allowed for systematic studies on spectroscopic properties of medium-heavy and heavy nuclei, including those that are far from the line of $\beta$ stability. The method is extended to study intriguing nuclear structure phenomena that include shape phase transitions and coexistence, octupole deformation and collectivity, and the coupling of the single-particle to collective degrees of freedom, which is crucial to describe structures of odd nuclei, and $\beta$ and $\beta\beta$ decays.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-decay properties of some astrophysically important Sc-isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the late progressive stages of heavy stars, electron capture and $\beta^\pm$-decay are the governing processes. The weak rates are essential inputs for modeling the stages of high-mass stars before supernova explosions. As per results obtained from previous simulations, weak rates of Scandium isotopes contribute substantially in changing the lepton-to-baryon ratio ($Y_e$) of the nuclear matter in the core. In the present analysis, we report important $\beta^-$-decay properties of crucial Sc isotopes in an astrophysical environment with mass numbers $49 \leq A \leq 54$. The investigation includes Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions, terrestrial half-lives, and stellar rates of electron capture (EC) and $\beta^-$-decay reactions. The calculations are performed using the proton-neutron (pn) quasi-particle random phase approximation (QRPA) model over a wide temperature range ($10^7$-$3 \times 10^{10}$ K) and density range ($10^1 - 10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$). Additionally, we compare our calculated results with available experimental and theoretical data. A good agreement is observed between our calculated half-lives and experimentally measured values. Our weak $\beta^-$-decay and EC rates are compared with those from the Independent-Particle Model (IPM) and Large-Scale Shell Model (LSSM). At high stellar temperatures and densities, our calculated $\beta^-$-decay rates are smaller than those from the other models.</description>

      <title>Revealing the harmonic structure of nuclear two-body correlations in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smashing nuclei at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the momentum distribution of outgoing debris provides a powerful method to probe the many-body properties of the incoming nuclear ground states. Within a perturbative description of initial-state fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma, we express the measurement of anisotropic flow in ultra-central heavy-ion collisions as the quantum-mechanical average of a specific set of operators measuring the harmonic structure of the two-body azimuthal correlations among nucleons in the colliding states. These observables shed a new light on spatial correlations in atomic nuclei, while enabling us to test the complementary pictures of nuclear structure delivered by low- and high-energy experiments on the basis of state-of-the-art theoretical approaches rooted in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid neural network method of a multilayer perceptron and autoencoder for the {\alpha}-particle preformation factor in {\alpha}-decay theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preformation factor quantifies the probability of {\alpha} particles preforming on the surface of the parent nucleus in decay theory and is closely related to the study of {\alpha} clustering structure. In this work, a multilayer perceptron and autoencoder (MLP + AE) hybrid neural network method is introduced to extract preformation factors within the generalized liquid drop model and experimental data. A K-fold cross validation method is also adopted. The accuracy of the preformation factor calculated by this improved neural network is comparable to the results of the empirical formula. MLP + AE can effectively capture the linear relationship between the logarithm of the preformation factor and the square root of the ratio of the decay energy, further verifying that Geiger-Nuttall law can deal with preformation factor. The extracted preformation probability of isotope and isotone chains show different trends near the magic number, and in addition, an odd-even staggering effect appears. This means that the preformation factors are affected by closed shells and unpaired nucleons. Therefore the preformation factors can provide nuclear structure information. Furthermore, for 41 new nuclides, the half-lives introduced with the preformation factors reproduce the experimental values as expected. Finally, the preformation factors and {\alpha}-decay half-lives of Z = 119 and 120 superheavy nuclei are predicted.</description>

      <title>Rapidity spectra in high-energy collisions and longitudinal nuclear suppression from nonadditive statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the longitudinal nuclear suppression factor defined by a scaled ratio of rapidity distributions. To study this experimental observable, we describe three approaches involving numerical and analytical calculations. We first approach this problem by conducting model studies using EPOS, FTFP$_{BERT}$, and HIJING, and notice that while EPOS shows a decreasing trend of this ratio for increasing rapidity, the latter two model calculations display an increment of the ratio. The analytical approaches involve, first, the quasi-exponential distribution obtained from the Tsallis statistics, and second, the nonadditive Boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation time approximation. We notice that our analytical results satisfactorily describe NA61 experimental data (for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and 17.3 GeV) for the negatively charged pions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of deep-inelastic $e+p$ scattering data from HERA and transverse energy distributions in $p+p$ and $p+\Pb$ collisions, alongside charged hadron multiplicities in $\Pb+\Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02\;\mathrm{TeV}$ from ALICE. Using a saturation-based initial state model grounded in high-energy QCD, we determine the early-time non-equilibrium shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma. Our results provide new insights into the early-time transport properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Evidence for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The D-measure of event-by-event net-charge fluctuations was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative heavy quark diffusion coefficients in a weakly magnetized thermal QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions to the heavy quark (HQ) momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients are computed in a weak background magnetic field. The formalism adopted here involves calculation of the in-medium potential of the HQ in a weak magnetic field, which then serves as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator in the calculation of HQ self-energy ($\Sigma$). The self-energy determines the scattering rate of HQs with light thermal partons, which is subsequently used to evaluate $\kappa$ and $D_s$. It is observed that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low temperature. The spatial diffusion coefficient $2\pi T D_s$, exhibits good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be applied to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies. An extension of this formalism to the case of finite HQ momentum has also been attempted.</description>

      <title>The temperature dependence of fractional topological charge objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for defining the topological charge contained within distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields of SU(N) lattice gauge theory. Such an analysis has been called for by the growing number of models for Yang-Mills topological structure which propose the existence of fractionally charged objects. This investigation is performed for SU(3) at a range of temperatures across the deconfinement phase transition, providing an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. This reveals a connection between the topological charge and holonomy of the system which must be satisfied by finite-temperature models of Yang-Mills vacuum structure. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for SU(N) vacuum structure.</description>

      <title>ToMCCA-3: A realistic 3-body coalescence model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of light nuclei in high-energy collisions provides valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction and the structure of the particle-emitting source. Understanding this process is crucial not only for nuclear physics but also for astrophysical studies, where the production of rare antinuclei could serve as a probe for new physics. This work presents a three-body coalescence model based on the Wigner function formalism, offering a refined description of light-nucleus production. By incorporating realistic two- and three-body nuclear interaction potentials constrained by modern scattering and femtoscopic correlation data, our approach improves on traditional coalescence models. The framework is validated using event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV to predict the momentum spectra of light (anti) nuclear nuclei with mass number $A=3$, which are then compared with the experimental data from ALICE. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of light nucleus yields to the choice of nuclear wave functions, emphasizing the importance of an accurate description of the coalescence process. This model lays the foundation for the extension of coalescence studies of $A=3$ light nuclei to a wider range of collision systems and energies.</description>

      <title>Backward DVCS in a Sullivan process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesons' internal structure and dynamics may be accessed through hard exclusive electroproduction processes such as deeply virtual Compton scattering in both near forward and near backward kinematics. With the help of the Sullivan process which allows us to use a nucleon target as a quasi-real $\pi$ meson emitter, we study backward scattering in the framework of collinear QCD factorization where pion-to-photon transition distribution amplitudes describe the photon content of the $\pi$ meson. We present a model of these TDAs based on the overlap of lightfront wave functions primarily developed for generalized parton distributions, using a previously developed pion lightfront wave function and deriving a new model for the lightfront wave functions of the photon. This leads us to an estimate of the cross-sections for JLab energies. We conclude that deeply virtual $ep\rightarrow e\gamma M n$ processes, in backward kinematics, may be experimentally discovered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Identifying weak critical fluctuations of intermittency in heavy-ion collisions with topological machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large density fluctuations of conserved charges have been proposed as a promising signature for exploring the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations are expected to exhibit a fractal or scale-invariant behavior, which can be probed by intermittency analysis. Recent high-energy experimental studies reveal that the signal of critical fluctuations related to intermittency is very weak and thus could be easily obscured by the overwhelming background particles in the data sample. Employing a point cloud neural network with topological machine learning, we can successfully classify weak signal events from background noise by the extracted distinct topological features, and accurately determine the intermittency index for weak signal event samples.</description>

      <title>Correlations between nuclear incompressibility, liquid-gas critical point, and quarkyonic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically probe different parametrizations of the attractive nuclear force based on real gas models to construct the nuclear matter equation of state. In each of the cases, the repulsion between nucleons is treated in the framework of excluded volume, and interaction parameters are fitted to the empirical properties of the nuclear ground state. We calculate the critical temperature $T_c$ and critical particle number density $n_c$, and find that they are strongly correlated. Both are also correlated with the incompressibility $K_0$ in the nuclear ground state. We also include a quarkyonic matter phase in the quasiparticle description and investigate the relationships among $K_0$, transition density to the quarkyonic phase, $n_{tr}$, and corresponding peak in the speed of sound, $v_{s, {\rm max}}^2$. At each density, the quark fraction is found by minimizing the energy density. We find that both $n_{tr}$ and $v_{s, {\rm max}}^2$ are negatively correlated with $K_0$, $n_c$, and $T_c$.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a 1+1D toy model of particle space-time evolution. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energies. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei and the quark-gluon plasma hadronisation paradox. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Gluon Saturation Effects in Exclusive Heavy Vector Meson Photoproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exclusive $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction for proton and Pb targets in the high-energy limit, with the energy dependence computed using the linear Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov and the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equations. The difference between these two evolution equations can be directly attributed to gluon saturation physics. We find that for proton targets there is no difference between the two approaches at the energies of the currently available data, while for Pb targets in $J/\psi$ production the data shows a clear preference for the evolution with gluon saturation.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Studying the $K\Lambda$ strong interaction with femtoscopic correlation functions and the $N^*(1535)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $K \Lambda$ strong interaction dynamics around the energy region of $N^*(1535)$ resonance through femtoscopic correlation functions within the Koonin-Pratt formalism, where coupled-channel effects of $\pi N$, $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$ and $\eta N$ channels are taken into account, by means of which the $N^*(1535)$ resonance can be dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach. Two-body scattering amplitudes are calculated using the chiral unitary approach, and the corresponding wave functions and correlation functions are obtained. Our analysis shows that the $\pi N$ channel becomes important to the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function through coupled channel effects, even if its mass threshold is far from the energy region of the $N^*(1535)$. Furthermore, with the picture that the $N^*(1535)$ is a dynamically generated state, we can get a good reproduction of the experimental data on the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function. This work establishes femtoscopic correlation functions as a sensitive probe for coupled-channel dynamics and validates the Koonin-Pratt framework in multi-channel hadronic systems, offering critical insights into some exotic hadron states and strong interaction mechanisms.</description>
