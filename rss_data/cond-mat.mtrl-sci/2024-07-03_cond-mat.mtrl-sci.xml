      <title>Harmonizing Microstructures and Enhancing Mechanical Resilience: Novel Powder Metallurgy Approach for Zn-Mg Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc alloys are recognised for their excellent biocompatibility and favourable corrosion rates, making them suitable for bioabsorbable implants. However, their mechanical properties necessitate improvement to fulfil the rigorous requirements of biomedical applications. This research focuses on engineering pseudo-harmonic structures within zinc alloys through a comprehensive method combining mechanical alloying, spark plasma sintering, and hot extrusion techniques. This fabrication process results in a composite material characterised by a soft core surrounded by a continuous, three-dimensional, ultrafine-grained hard shell. The experiment involved blending pure zinc with Zn-1Mg alloy powder, leading to the formation of both ductile zinc and fine-grained Zn-1Mg regions. While the Mg2Zn11 intermetallic phase was found to enhance the alloy's mechanical strength, the presence of oxide shells adversely affected the material's properties. The elimination of these shells via hot extrusion markedly improved the alloy's tensile strength, reaching an average value of tensile strength of 333 MPa. This study provides significant insights into the material engineering of zinc-based alloys for biodegradable implant applications, demonstrating a viable approach to optimising their mechanical performance.</description>

      <title>Fracture Characteristics of Rare-earth Phosphate under Molten Calcium Magnesium Aluminosilicate Corrosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fracture characteristics of LuPO4 rare-earth phosphate environmental barrier coating (EBC) material under molten calcium-magnesium aluminosilicate (CMAS) corrosion is quantified. EBCs are crucial for protecting SiC-based ceramic matrix composite components in the hot section of gas turbine engines. Recent research has highlighted the potential of rare-earth phosphates as better EBC materials than third-generation rare-earth silicates for CMAS corrosion resistance. However, the fracture of EBCs under CMAS corrosion during service remains a significant concern. This work investigates the fracture behavior of LuPO4 using mesoscale simulation and experiments. The model uses micrographs taken from fabricated EBC samples for mesoscale fracture simulations. The simulation results are compared with experimental fracture toughness data and validated using statistical tests (p&lt;0.01). The simulation results and experimental observations demonstrate that LuPO4 may exhibit higher fracture resistance than Lu2SiO5 rare-earth silicate under similar CMAS corrosion conditions, offering potential insights for future EBC design and development.</description>

      <title>Switchable Ferroelectricity in Subnano Silicon Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the critical need to develop ferroelectric materials compatible with silicon. We systematically explore possible ferroelectric silicon quantum films and discover a low-energy variant (hex-OR-2*2-P) with energy just 1 meV/atom above the ground state (hex-OR-2*2). Both hex-OR-2*2 and hex-OR-2*2-P are confirmed to be dynamically and mechanically stable semiconductors with indirect gaps of 1.323 eV and 1.311 eV, respectively. The ferroelectric hex-OR-2*2-P exhibits remarkable in-plane spontaneous polarization up to 120 Pc/m and is protected by a potential barrier (13.33 meV/atom) from spontaneously transitioning to hex-OR-22. To simulate the switching ferroelectricity in electric fields of the single-element silicon bilayer, we develop a method that simultaneously learns interatomic potentials and Born effective charges (BEC) in a single equivariant model with a physically informed loss. Our method demonstrates good performance on several ferroelectrics. Simulations of hex-OR-2*2-P silicon suggest a depolarization temperature of approximately 300 K and a coercive field of about 0.05 V/{\AA}. These results indicate that silicon-based ferroelectric devices are feasible, and the ground state phase of the silicon bilayer (hex-OR-2*2) is an ideal system. Our findings highlight the promise of pure silicon ferroelectric materials for future experimental synthesis and applications in memory devices, sensors, and energy converters.</description>

      <title>Local-time formula for dissipation in solid ionic electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When ions move through solids, they interact with the solid's constituent atoms and cause them to vibrate around their equilibrium points. This vibration, in turn, modifies the potential landscape through which the mobile ions travel. Because the present-time potential depends on past interactions, the coupling is inherently non-local in time, making its numerical and analytical treatment challenging. For sufficiently slow-moving ions, we linearize the phonon spectrum to show that these non-local effects can be ignored, giving rise to a drag-like force. Unlike the more familiar drag coefficient in liquids, the drag takes on a matrix form due to the crystalline structure of the framework. We numerically simulate trajectories and dissipation rates using both the time-local and non-local formulas to validate our simplification. The time-local formula dramatically reduces the computational cost of calculating the motion of mobile particle through a crystalline framework and clearly connects the properties of the material to the drag experienced by the particle.</description>

      <title>Description of Molecular Chirality and its Analysis via High Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clarify the microscopic origin of chirality-induced optical effect, we develop an analytical method that extracts the chiral part of the Hamiltonian of molecular electronic states. We demonstrate this method in a model chiral molecule consisting of helically stacked two $N$ regular polygons, and compare it with numerical calculation for chiral discrimination via high-harmonic generation (HHG) of the same molecule. The discrimination signal here is the difference between the harmonic intensity from the bicircular laser field and that from its reflected laser field, resulting in a pseudoscalar quantity that reflects the chirality of the molecule. As a result, we find that, to obtain the large discrimination signal via HHG difference, the increase of capacity to generate the polar quantity is more advantageous than maximizing the conversion efficiency via the optimization of molecular chirality. We speculate this criteria may be extended to other optical and current-induced processes relevant to the chiral molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulation for coalescence of vacancies in tungsten crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations of coalescence of two vacancies in a tungsten (W) crystal to elucidate the effect of temperature and hydrogen atoms. Simulations were performed for two types of vacancy structures, $\mathrm{V}_9 + \mathrm{W}_1 + \mathrm{V}_9$ and $\mathrm{V}_{10} + \mathrm{W}_4 + \mathrm{V}_{10}$ ($\mathrm{V}_{n}$ means that a vacancy corresponds to the absence of $n$ W atoms, and $\mathrm{W}_{m}$ indicates that there are $m$ W atoms between two vacancies) in various cases of temperature and hydrogen atom concentration. Under the vacancy structure $\mathrm{V}_9 + \mathrm{W}_1 + \mathrm{V}_9$, we observed vacancy coalescence for all the cases of the temperature and the number of hydrogen atoms. Evaluating the potential energy required for removing one of the W atoms between two vacancies, we found that high temperature and existing hydrogen atoms in the vacancies facilitate vacancy coalescence, and that under the structure $\mathrm{V}_{10} + \mathrm{W}_4 + \mathrm{V}_{10}$, hydrogen atoms facilitate vacancy coalescence most strongly when the number is around 45 to 54 in each vacancy.</description>

      <title>In-situ topotactic chemical reaction for spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topotactic chemical reaction (TCR) is a chemical process that transforms one crystalline phase to another while maintaining one or more of the original structural frameworks, typically induced by the local insertion, removal, or replacement of atoms in a crystal. The utilization of TCR in atomic-layer materials and surfaces of bulk crystals leads to exotic quantum phases, as highlighted by the control of topological phases, the emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity, and the realization of 2D ferromagnetism. Advanced surface-sensitive spectroscopies such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) are leading techniques to visualize the electronic structure of such exotic states and provide us a guide to further functionalize material properties. In this review article, we summarize the recent progress in this field, with particular emphasis on intriguing results obtained by combining spectroscopies and TCR in thin films.</description>

      <title>Magnetic critical phenomena and low temperature re-entrant spin-glass features of Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A detailed investigation of the structural and magnetic properties, including magnetocaloric effect, re-entrant spin-glass behavior at low temperature, and critical behavior in polycrystalline Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy is reported. The prepared alloy crystallizes in a cubic CsCl-type crystal structure with Pm-3m space group. The temperature-dependent magnetization data reveals a second-order paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition ($\sim$ 122.9 K), which is further supported by the analysis of the magnetocaloric effect. The isothermal magnetization loops show a soft ferromagnetic behavior of the studied alloy and also reveal an itinerant character of the underlying exchange interactions. In order to understand the nature of magnetic interactions, the critical exponents for spontaneous magnetization, initial magnetic susceptibility, and critical MH isotherm are determined using Modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plots, and critical isotherm analysis. The derived critical exponents $\beta$ = 0.363(2), $\gamma$ = 1.384(3), and $\delta$ = 4.81(3) confirm the critical behavior similar to that of a 3D-Heisenberg-type ferromagnet with short-range exchange interactions that are found to decay with distance as J(r) $\approx$ r$^{-4.936}$. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the AC susceptibility data suggests that the frequency-dependent shifting of the peak temperatures is well explained using standard dynamic scaling laws such as the critical slowing down model and Vogel-Fulcher law, and confirms the signature of re-entrant spin-glass features in Al$_2$MnFe Heusler alloy. Furthermore, maximum magnetic entropy change of $\sim$ 1.92 J/kg-K and relative cooling power of $\sim$ 496 J/kg at 50 kOe applied magnetic field are determined from magnetocaloric studies that are comparable to those of other Mn-Fe-Al systems.</description>

      <title>ML-extendable framework for multiphysics-multiscale simulation workflow and data management using Kadi4Mat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As material modeling and simulation has become vital for modern materials science, research data with distinctive physical principles and extensive volume are generally required for full elucidation of the material behavior across all relevant scales. Effective workflow and data management, with corresponding metadata descriptions, helps leverage the full potential of data-driven analyses for computer-aided material design. In this work, we propose a research workflow and data management (RWDM) framework to manage complex workflows and resulting research (meta)data, while following FAIR principles. Multiphysics multiscale simulations for additive manufacturing investigations are treated as showcase and implemented on Kadi4Mat: an open source research data infrastructure. The input and output data of the simulations, together with the associated setups and scripts realizing the simulation workflow, are curated in corresponding standardized Kadi4Mat records with extendibility for further research and data-driven analyses. These records are interlinked to indicate information flow and form an ontology based knowledge graph. Automation scheme for performing high-throughput simulation and post-processing integrated with the proposed RWDM framework is also presented.</description>

      <title>PINNs-MPF: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Multi-Phase-Field Simulation of Interface Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Point Defect Properties Near Surfaces in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now widely recognized that surface and interfacial defects exhibit distinct behavior compared to bulk defects in metal halide perovskites. However, the transition from bulk to surface behavior and the spatial extent of the surface's influence are not well understood. To address this, we conducted first-principles calculations on iodine vacancies and interstitial defects in methylammonium lead iodide and cesium lead iodide at various depths from the surface, enabling us to map out depth-dependent behavior. We find that the defect formation energy follows a saturating exponential curve as the defect moves away from the surface to the bulk. Using first-principles calculated defect formation energies, we quantify the extent of the surface's influence by calculating the decay length associated with each defect. The difference between the surface and bulk defect formation energy is found to be as high as 1.12 eV for the negatively charged iodine vacancy in methylammonium lead iodide, leading to the enrichment of the surface with defects. Through analysis of defective structures, we find that the differences in the bulk and surface defect properties are a consequence of different bond lengths and in some cases, even changes in bonding and coordination environments. Finally, we determine how the defect transition levels change as a function of the layer index, which could contribute to increased non-radiative recombination. Our findings pave the way for a systematic treatment of non-radiative losses in perovskite solar cells that incorporate spatially dependent defect densities and transition levels.</description>

      <title>Catalogue of $C$-paired spin-valley locking in antiferromagnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) have been gaining lots of attentions due to its great potential in spintronics devices and the recently discovered novel spin structure in the momentum space, i.e., $C$-paired spin-valley or spin-momentum locking (CSVL), where spins and valleys/momenta are locked to each other due to the crystal symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization. Here, we systematically studied CSVLs and proposed a general theory and algorithm using little co-group and coset representatives, which reveals that 12 elementary kinds of CSVLs, determined by the geometric relation of spins and valleys and the essential symmetry guaranteeing zero magnetization, are sufficient to fully represent all possible CSVLs. By combining the proposed algorithm and high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predicted 38 magnetic point groups and identified 140 experimentally verified AFMs that can realize CSVL. Besides predicting new materials, our theory can naturally reveal underlying mechanisms of CSVLs' responses to external fields. As an example, two qualitatively different types of piezomagnetism via occupation imbalance or spin tilting were predicted in RuO$_2$. The algorithm and conclusions can be directly extended to the locking between valley/momentum and any other pseudo-vector degree of freedom, e.g. Berry curvature, as exemplified in RuO$_2$, and the proposed concept and methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other symmetry groups such as spin space group.</description>

      <title>Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are heterogeneous materials harder to break than homogeneous ones? Predicting rapid crack propagation in the presence of inhomogeneities remains a challenge. Linear perturbations leave the net speed of fracture unchanged. We obtain a nonlinear equation of motion for planar crack fronts to gain insight into the dynamic fracture of moderately heterogeneous solids. The coupling of the front geometry to the heterogeneity landscape renormalizes the energy dissipation and the crack velocity. In materials whose toughness is weakly sensitive to crack speed, such as silica glass, heterogeneity results in increased dissipation and slower crack propagation. However, heterogeneity has a reduced effect and may even facilitate fracture in strongly velocity-dependent materials.</description>

      <title>Improved Long-Term Prediction of Chaos Using Reservoir Computing Based on Stochastic Spin-Orbit Torque Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting chaotic systems is crucial for understanding complex behaviors, yet challenging due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and inherent unpredictability. Probabilistic Reservoir Computing (RC) is well-suited for long-term chaotic predictions by handling complex dynamic systems. Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) devices in spintronics, with their nonlinear and probabilistic operations, can enhance performance in these tasks. This study proposes an RC system utilizing SOT devices for predicting chaotic dynamics. By simulating the reservoir in an RC network with SOT devices that achieve nonlinear resistance changes with random distribution, we enhance the robustness for the predictive capability of the model. The RC network predicted the behaviors of the Mackey-Glass and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating that stochastic SOT devices significantly improve long-term prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Inorganic Exciton Peak Position in 2D Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites from Hybrid Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the inorganic exciton contribution to 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites is essential to understand their properties and screen for new materials. Here, we combine hybrid density functional theory calculations including spin orbit coupling (SOC) with the experimental relationship between the inorganic band gap and exciton binding energy to predict the inorganic exciton energy. For this purpose, we determine a universal exchange parameter for the HSE06 hybrid functional with SOC for lead-based 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. We further identify a relationship that connects PBE calculations to experiment-quality optical gaps and allows us to generalize the exchange mixing parameter other SOC approximations. Our approach opens the path to screen for 2D hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with optimized spectra, e.g., for new solar cell or light emitting materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spin-phonon coupling in Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ double perovskite oxide: a combined experimental and ab-initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental interactions that is found in many functional materials is the spin-phonon coupling (SPC), which is at the heart of many novel functionalities. The simultaneous presence of multi-magnetic phases makes SPC even more intriguing. We have used Raman spectroscopy as well as first-principles methods to investigate the possibility of the appearance of SPC in Gd-doped Y$_2$CoMnO$_6$ (YGCMO) double perovskite oxide and the influence of anti-site disorder on the same. YGCMO is found to exhibit anti-site disorder leading to both ferromagnetic (between Co and Mn) and anti-ferromagnetic interactions (Co-Co, Mn-Mn, Gd-Co/Mn). An analysis of the temperature-dependent phonon frequency for the stretching modes of YGCMO, obtained using RAMAN spectroscopy, indicates that SPC is possibly emerging from simultaneous presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The nature of the phonon linewidth and the insulating state of the material eliminate the role of magnetostriction on the observed anomaly. The spin-phonon coupling strength comes out to be 0.29 cm$^{-1}$. Our experimental findings are corroborated by first-principles DFT calculations which indicate the presence of SPC in ordered YGCMO getting enhanced in the presence of anti-site disorder. This indicates a strong influence of B-site (Co/Mn) ordering on SPC in the bulk double perovskite systems. An analysis of the cause behind the enhanced SPC in the presence of anti-site disorder is also presented.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of multifaceted properties; lattice dynamic, structural stability, mechanical, electronic, magnetic and thermodynamic response of Alkali metals-based semi Heusler alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking into considerations the wide compositional stretch of Heusler alloys, the first principles density functional theory based calculations are excellently suitable for estimating the multifaceted properties of alkali metal based LiVSb and NaVSb Heusler alloys. We calculated ground state stability by optimizing the energy in alpha, beta and gamma phase configurations. The materials are dynamically stable in spin polarised phase type alpha. To explore the electronic structure, we successfully employed the generalized gradient approximation potential. The electronic band structures indicate a half-metallic nature featuring a wide indirect band gap of 1.40eV and 1.45eV. We computed the second-order elastic parameters at different pressure levels. The Pugh ratio less than 0.25 assessed that both alloys are brittle in nature and mechanically stable. The obtained magnetic moment is consistent with the Slater-Pauling rule. By executing the Quasi-Harmonic Debye model and Boltzmann theory we assessed the various thermodynamic parameters and transport coefficients of both alloys at different temperatures and pressures. All positive frequencies in lattice dynamic study confirmed their stability. Our findings highlight the potential of these alloys in modern semiconductor technology, and thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the parameter dependence of atomic minima with implicit differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential to go beyond ab initio size limitations, but simulation results depend sensitively on potential parameters. Forward propagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification, whilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such as fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions defined as a fixed point is used to Taylor expand the energy and structure of atomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic differentiation, dense linear algebra or a novel sparse operator approach. The latter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures of arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts lattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and machine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation without prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be used to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to fine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at dislocations in tungsten.</description>

Abstract: The suitability of a range of interatomic potentials for elemental tin was evaluated in order to identify an appropriate potential for modeling the stanene (2D tin) allotropes. Structural and mechanical properties of the flat (F), low-buckled (LB), high-buckled (HB), full dumbbell (FD), trigonal dumbbell (TD), honeycomb dumbbell (HD) and large honeycomb dumbbell (LHD) monolayer tin (stanene) phases, were gained by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular statics (MS) calculations with ten different Tersoff, modified embedded atom method (MEAM) and machine-learning-based (ML-IAP) interatomic potentials. A systematic quantitative comparison and discussion of the results are reported.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the thermoelectric transport coefficient across the metal-insulator crossover in the doped Fermi Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the doping-dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, as calculated from the Kelvin formula, for the Fermi Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</description>

      <title>Enhancing resonant second harmonic generation in bilayer WSe2 by layer-dependent exciton-polaron effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials serve as exceptional platforms for controlled second harmonic generation (SHG), an important nonlinear optical phenomenon with diverse applications. Current approaches to SHG control often depend on non-resonant conditions or symmetry breaking via single-gate control. Here, we employ dual-gate bilayer WSe2 to demonstrate a new SHG enhancement concept that leverages strong exciton resonance and layer-dependent exciton-polaron effect. By selectively localizing injected holes within one layer, we induce exciton-polaron states in the hole-filled layer while maintaining normal exciton states in the charge-neutral layer. The distinct resonant conditions of these layers effectively break interlayer inversion symmetry, thereby promoting resonant SHG. Our method achieves a remarkable 40-fold enhancement of SHG at minimal electric field, equivalent to conditions near the dielectric-breakdown threshold but using only ~3% of the critical breakdown field. Our findings also reveal significant sensitivity of resonant SHG to carrier density and carrier type, with distinct enhancement and quenching observed across different gating regimes. This advancement offers an innovative approach to manipulating SHG in 2D excitonic materials and provides a potent spectroscopic tool for probing layer-dependent quantum states.</description>

      <title>Atypical antiferromagnetic ordering in single crystalline quasi-2D honeycomb magnet YbI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we study YbI$_3$, a quasi-2D layered material with Yb atoms arranged on an ideal honeycomb network of edge-sharing YbI$_6$ octahedra, analogous to the low-temperature phase of $\alpha-$RuCl$_3$. High quality single crystals of YbI$_3$ are grown from Yb and I as starting precursors, using the vapor transport technique. The grown crystals are characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, magnetization, and heat capacity probes. The crystal-field split ground state of Yb$^{3+}$ in \Yb~ is a well-isolated Kramers doublet with an effective moment $\rm J_{eff} = 1/2$. Upon cooling, the low-temperature heat capacity of \Yb~ reveals a broad peak at $\rm T_1 = 0.95$~K due to short-range ordering of the Yb moments, followed by a sharp peak at $\rm T_2 = T_N = 0.6$~K due to long-range ordering. The magnetic behavior is found to be weakly anisotropic with $\chi^\parallel &gt; \chi^\perp$, where $\chi^\parallel$ and $\chi^\perp$ refers to the in-plane ($H \parallel ab$) and out-of-plane ($H \perp ab$) susceptibilities. The 2~K isothermal magnetization saturates at $\rm \approx~1.5~\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (in-plane) and $\rm \approx~1~\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (out-of-plane), suggesting the anisotropy to be easy-plane type. Low-temperature heat capacity, well below T$_N$, is found to vary as T$^\alpha$ with $\alpha~\approx~2.5$, indicating a possible unconventional magnetic ground state for YbI$_3$.</description>

      <title>Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in topological insulator nanowires proximitized by Nb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a nonlocal transport phenomenon that creates/detects Cooper-pair correlations between distant places. It is also the basis of Cooper-pair splitting to generate remote entanglement. Although CAR has been extensively studied in semiconductors proximity-coupled to a superconductor, it has been very difficult to observe it in a topological insulator (TI). Here we report the first observation of CAR in a proximitized TI nanowire (TINW). We performed local and nonlocal conductance spectroscopy on mesoscopic TINW devices in which superconducting (Nb) and metallic (Pt/Au) contacts are made on a bulk-insulating TINW. The local conductance detected a hard gap, accompanied by the appearance of Andreev bound states that can reach zero-bias, while a negative nonlocal conductance was occasionally observed upon sweeping the chemical potential, giving evidence for CAR. Surprisingly, the CAR signal was detected even over 1.5 $\mu$m, which implies that pair correlations extend over a length scale much longer than the expected superconducting coherence length of either Nb or the proximitised TINW. Such a long-range CAR effect is possibly due to an intricate role of disorder in proximitized nanowires. Also, our 0.9-$\mu$m device presented a decent Cooper-pair splitting efficiency of up to 0.5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permanent magnets are used in various products and essential for human society. If omnipresent permanent magnets could directly convert heat into electricity, they would lead to innovative energy harvesting and thermal management technologies. However, achieving such "multifunctionality" has been difficult because of the poor thermoelectric performance of conventional magnets. Here, we develop a multifunctional composite magnet that enables giant transverse thermoelectric conversion. The developed composite material, comprising alternately and obliquely stacked SmCo$_{5}$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_{3}$ multilayers, exhibits large remanent magnetization and coercivity as well as an excellent figure of merit of 0.22 for transverse thermoelectric conversion at room temperature owing to the optimized anisotropic composite structure and extremely low interfacial electrical and thermal resistances. While having versatile transverse geometry, the thermopile module based on these composite materials generates 204 mW at a temperature difference of 152 K. The corresponding power density normalized by heat transfer area and temperature gradient is not only record-high among the transverse thermoelectric modules but also comparable to that of the longitudinal thermoelectric modules including commercial products based on the Seebeck effect. The additive magnetic functionality enables efficient thermal energy harvesting and integrates thermoelectric conversion capabilities wherever permanent magnets are currently used.</description>

      <title>Effects of mechanical stress, chemical potential, and coverage on hydrogen solubility during hydrogen-enhanced decohesion of ferritic steel grain boundaries: A first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) is one of the many mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement, a phenomenon that severely impacts structural materials such as iron and iron alloys. Grain boundaries (GBs) play a critical role in this mechanism, where they can provide trapping sites or act as hydrogen diffusion pathways. The interaction of H with GBs and other crystallographic defects, and thus the solubility and distribution of H in the microstructure, depends on the concentration, chemical potential, and local stress. Therefore, for a quantitative assessment of HEDE, a generalized solution energy in conjunction with the cohesive strength as a function of hydrogen coverage is needed. In this paper, we carry out density functional theory calculations to investigate the influence of H on the decohesion of the $\Sigma$5(310)[001] and $\Sigma$3(112)[1$\bar{1}$0] symmetrical tilt GBs in bcc Fe, as examples for open and close-packed GB structures. A method to identify the segregation sites at the GB plane is proposed. The results indicate that at higher local concentrations, H leads to a significant reduction of the cohesive strength of the GB planes, significantly more pronounced at the $\Sigma$5 than at the $\Sigma$3 GB. Interestingly, at finite stress, the $\Sigma$3 GB becomes more favorable for H solution, as opposed to the case of zero stress, where the $\Sigma$5 GB is more attractive. This suggests that, under certain conditions, stresses in the microstructure can lead to a redistribution of H to the stronger grain boundary, which opens a path to designing H-resistant microstructures. To round up our study, we investigate the effects of typical alloying elements in ferritic steel, C, V, Cr, and Mn, on the solubility of H and the strength of the GBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we report on an elastic and inelastic neutron scattering study addressing the effect of electric fields on quantum paraelectric SrTiO3. Our elastic scattering results find small changes as a function of field in a superlattice reflection that sample the octahedral rotations, which is indicative of only weak coupling of octahedral rotation and electric polarization. By collecting not only the change in gap, but also of the dispersion, we can better quantify the changes in the lattice dynamics. The findings are put in context to recent field DFT calculations predicting the E-field effect on the atomic motions of the lowest lying transverse optical (soft) mode. We find hints of non-linear coupling to the acoustic mode and to the phonon with polarization perpendicular to the E-field, which shows the non-linearity in the chemical potential that is also relevant when strongly driving SrTiO3 with E-field (THz) pulses.</description>

      <title>Understanding magnetic hyperthermia performance within the "Brezovich criterion": beyond the uniaxial anisotropy description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Careful determination of the heating performance of magnetic nanoparticles under AC fields is critical for magnetic hyperthermia applications. However, most interpretations of experimental data are based on the uniaxial anisotropy approximation, which in first instance can be correlated with particle aspect ratio. This is to say, the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy is discarded, under the assumption that the shape contribution dominates. We show in this work that such premise, generally valid for large field amplitudes, does not hold for describing hyperthermia experiments carried out under small field values. Specifically, given its relevance for \textit{in vivo} applications, we focus our analysis on the so-called "Brezovich criterion", $H\cdot{f}=4.85\times{10^8}A/m\cdot{s}$. By means of a computational model, we show that the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy plays a critical role in defining the heat output, determining also the role of shape and aspect ratio of the particles on the SLP. Our results indicate that even small deviations from spherical shape have an important impact in optimizing the heating performance. The influence of interparticle interactions on the dissipated heat is also evaluated. Our results call therefore for an improvement in the theoretical models used to interpret magnetic hyperthermia performance.</description>

Abstract: Delocalization error prevents density functional theory (DFT) from reaching its full potential, causing problems like systematically underestimated band gaps and misaligned energy levels at interfaces. We introduce lrLOSC to correct delocalization error in materials over a wide range of band gaps. We predict eleven materials' fundamental gaps to within 0.28 eV, while offering a nonzero correction to the total energy. Molecular properties are improved with the same theory (arXiv:2406.06345). lrLOSC is an essential step toward modeling molecules, materials, and their interfaces within the same DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic states in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of training, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for $s$-state exciton energies in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs): $E_{\text{ns}}=-{\text{Ry}}^*\times P_n/{(n-1/2+0.479\, r^*_0/\kappa)^2}$, $n=1,2,...$, where $r^*_0$ and $\kappa$ are the dimensionless screening length and dielectric constant of the surrounding medium; $\text{Ry}^*$ is an effective Rydberg energy scaled by the dielectric constant and exciton reduced mass; $P_n(r^*_0/\kappa)$ is a function of variables $n$ and $r^*_0/\kappa$. Its values are around 1.0 so we consider it a term that corrects the Rydberg energy. Despite the simple form, the suggested formula gives exciton energies with high precision compared to the exact numerical solutions that accurately describe recent experimental data for a large class of TMDC materials, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and MoTe$_2$. To achieve these results, we have developed a so-called regulated perturbation theory by combining the conventional perturbation method with several elements of the Feranchuk-Komarov operator method, including the Levi-Civita transformation, the algebraic calculation technique via the annihilation and creation operators, and the introduction of a free parameter to optimize the convergence rate of the perturbation series. This universal form of exciton energies could be helpful in various physical analyses, including retrieval of the material parameters such as reduced exciton mass and screening length from the available measured exciton energies.</description>

      <title>High-rate intercity quantum key distribution with a semiconductor single-photon source</title>

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables the transmission of information that is secure against general attacks by eavesdroppers. The use of on-demand quantum light sources in QKD protocols is expected to help improve security and maximum tolerable loss. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a promising building block for quantum communication applications because of the deterministic emission of single photons with high brightness and low multiphoton contribution. Here we report on the first intercity QKD experiment using a bright deterministic single photon source. A BB84 protocol based on polarisation encoding is realised using the high-rate single photons in the telecommunication C-band emitted from a semiconductor QD embedded in a circular Bragg grating structure. Utilising the 79 km long link with 25.49 dB loss (equivalent to 130 km for the direct-connected optical fibre) between the German cities of Hannover and Braunschweig, a record-high secret key bits per pulse of 4.8 * 10^{-5} with an average quantum bit error ratio of ~ 0.65 % are demonstrated. An asymptotic maximum tolerable loss of 28.11 dB is found, corresponding to a length of 144 km of standard telecommunication fibre. Deterministic semiconductor sources therefore challenge state-of-the-art QKD protocols and have the potential to excel in measurement device independent protocols and quantum repeater applications.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion model for surface structure discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generative diffusion model specifically tailored to the discovery of surface structures. The generative model takes into account substrate registry and periodicity by including masked atoms and $z$-directional confinement. Using a rotational equivariant neural network architecture, we design a method that trains a denoiser-network for diffusion alongside a force-field for guided sampling of low-energy surface phases. An effective data-augmentation scheme for training the denoiser-network is proposed to scale generation far beyond structure sizes represented in the training data. We showcase the generative model by investigating multiple surface systems and propose an atomistic structure model for a previously unknown silver-oxide domain-boundary of unprecedented size.</description>

      <title>From design to device: challenges and opportunities in computational discovery of p-type transparent conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-performance p-type transparent conductor (TC) does not yet exist, but could lead to advances in a wide range of optoelectronic applications and enable new architectures for, e.g., next-generation photovoltaic (PV) devices. High-throughput computational material screenings have been a promising approach to filter databases and identify new p-type TC candidates, and some of these predictions have been experimentally validated. However, most of these predicted candidates do not have experimentally-achieved properties on par with n-type TCs used in solar cells, and therefore have not yet been used in commercial devices. Thus, there is still a significant divide between transforming predictions into results that are actually achievable in the lab, and an even greater lag in scaling predicted materials into functional devices. In this perspective, we outline some of the major disconnects in this materials discovery process -- from scaling computational predictions into synthesizable crystals and thin films in the laboratory, to scaling lab-grown films into real-world solar devices -- and share insights to inform future strategies for TC discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Phonon Linewidths in Twisted Bilayer Graphene near Magic Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of the phonon linewidths in twisted bilayer graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions and anharmonic effects. The electronic structure is calculated using distance-dependent transfer integrals based on the atomistic Slater-Koster tight-binding formalism, including electron-electron interactions treated at the Hartree level, and the phonons are calculated using classical force fields. These ingredients are used to calculate the phonon linewidths arising from electron-phonon interactions. Furthermore, anharmonic effects on the linewidths are computed using the mode-projected velocity autocorrelation function obtained from classical molecular dynamics. We predict a moir\'e potential induced splitting of this mode, which arises due to contributions from high symmetry stacking regions. Our findings show that both electron-phonon and anharmonic effects have a significant impact on the linewidth of the Raman active G mode near the magic angle.</description>

      <title>Electron transporting bilayers for perovskite solar cells: spray coating deposition of c-TiO2/m-SnO2-quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein we present a comparative study among different mesoporous electron transporter layers (ETLs), namely nanometric m-TiO2, m-SnO2 and m-SnO2 quantum dots (QDs), deposited by spray coating method. The experimental data correlated with the photovoltaic parameters indicate that the SnO2 mesoporous layer obtained from the spray deposition of the in-house prepared QDs solution is the best candidate between the three used mesoporous ETLs. The use of the in-house prepared SnO2 QDs solution presents smaller agglomerates composed of 3 nm NPs resulting in the formation of a thinner, more uniform, and compact mesoporous ETL, compared with the other two ETL solutions. The formamidinium-methylamonium-potassium (FAMA@10K) perovskite deposited on this m-SnO2 QDs ETL presents a lower RMS, more uniformity and, a higher amount of PbI2. Interestingly, this higher concentration for PbI2 seems to enhance the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSC), compared to the other two mesoporous ETLs. Our work reveals that SnO2 QDs solution can be easily produced in the laboratory and it is more suited for the deposition of the mesoporous ETL when choosing a FAMA@10K configuration perovskite solar cell with power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 10%.</description>
