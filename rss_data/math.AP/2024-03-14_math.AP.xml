      <title>Between Maxwell and Born-Infeld: the presence of the magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our motivation is to consider an electromagnetic Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_q$, depending on a parameter such that, for $q=1$ it corresponds to the Born-Infeld Lagrangian density and for $q=2$ it restores the Maxwell one. The model in the presence of given charge and current densities is investigated. We solve the pure magnetostatic problem for $q\in(6/5,2)$. We also study the electrostatic problem in the presence of an assigned magnetic field for $q\in[1,2)$.</description>

      <title>Spectral inequalities for Schr\"odinger equations with various potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral inequalities of Schr\"odinger operator in the whole space for different potentials, which can be power growth or continuously vanishing at infinity. The spectral inequalities quantitatively depends on the density of the sensor sets with positive measure, growth rate of the potentials and spectrum (or eigenvalues). One important component in the poof is the adaptation of propagation of smallness argument for gradients in \cite{LM18}. As an application, we apply the spectral inequalities to obtain quantitative observability inequalities for heat equations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-differential operators on Homogeneous vector bundles over compact homogeneous manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a global theory of subelliptic pseudo-differential operators on arbitrary homogeneous vector bundles over orientable compact homogeneous manifolds. We will show that a global pseudo-differential calculus can be associated to the operators acting on any pair of homogeneous vector-bundles with base space $M,$ if the compact Lie group $G$ that acts on $M=G/K$ is endowed with a (Riemannian or) sub-Riemannian structure. This is always possible if we choose on $G$ a sub-Laplacian associated to a H\"ormander system of vector-fields or we fix the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $G$. We begin with developing a global subelliptic symbolic calculus for vector-valued pseudo-differential operators on $G$ and then, we show that this vector-valued calculus induces a pseudo-differential calculus on homogeneous vector bundles, which, among other things, is stable under the action of the complex functional calculus. We prove global versions of the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt theorem, Fefferman theorem and also, of the G\r{a}rding inequality. We present applications of the obtained G\r{a}rding inequality to the wellposedness of evolution problems. We characterise the classes of pseudo-differential operators on homogeneous vector bundles in the sense of H\"ormander (which are defined by using local coordinate systems) in terms of their global symbols. Finally, using this formalism, we compute the global symbol of the exterior derivative, its adjoint, and the symbol of the Dirac operator on the vector bundle of differential forms. We hope that this work will provide a solid foundation for further research using the global quantisation of operators on (vector-bundles over) compact homogeneous manifolds.</description>

      <title>Long time dynamics for helical vortex filament in Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equation \begin{equation*}\left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;\partial_t \Omega+U \cdot \nabla \Omega-\Omega\cdot \nabla U=0 \\ &amp;\Omega(x,0)=\Omega_0(x) \end{aligned}\right. \end{equation*} under the assumption that $\Omega^z$ is helical and in the absence of vorticity stretching. Assuming that the initial vorticity $\Omega_0$ is primarily concentrated within an $\epsilon$ neighborhood of a helix $\Gamma_0$, we prove that its solution $\Omega(\cdot,t)$ remain concentrated near a helix $\Gamma(t)$ for any $t \in [0,T)$, where $\Gamma(t)$ can be interpreted as $\Gamma_0$ rotating around the $x_3$ axis with a speed $V=C\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}+O(1)$. It should be emphasized that the dynamics for the helical vortex filament are exhibited on the time interval $[0,T)$, which is longer than $\left[0, \frac{T}{\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Global existence and asymptotic stability for the Toner-Tu model of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the Toner-Tu (TT) model, which is a hydrodynamic model describing the collective motion of numerous self-propelled agents. We analytically study the global-in-time well-posedness of the TT model near the steady-state solution in the ordered phase. We also show the large-time behavior of solutions showing that the steady-state solution is polynomially stable in a Sobolev space in the sense that solutions that are initially close to that steady state converge to that at least polynomially fast as time tends to infinity. Moreover, we investigate the variant of the TT model which describes the dynamics of the actin filament.</description>

      <title>Regularity and trend to equilibrium for a non-local advection-diffusion model of active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish regularity and, under suitable assumptions, convergence to stationary states for weak solutions of a parabolic equation with a non-linear non-local drift term; this equation was derived from a model of active Brownian particles with repulsive interactions in a previous work, which incorporates advection-diffusion processes both in particle position and orientation. We apply De Giorgi's method and differentiate the equation with respect to the time variable iteratively to show that weak solutions become smooth away from the initial time. This strategy requires that we obtain improved integrability estimates in order to cater for the presence of the non-local drift. The instantaneous smoothing effect observed for weak solutions is shown to also hold for very weak solutions arising from distributional initial data; the proof of this result relies on a uniqueness theorem in the style of M.~Pierre for low-regularity solutions. The convergence to stationary states is proved under a smallness assumption on the drift term.</description>

      <title>Existence and concentration of normalized solutions for $p$-Laplacian equations with logarithmic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and concentration of normalized solutions for a $p$-Laplacian problem with logarithmic nonlinearity of type \[
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  \displaystyle -\varepsilon^p\Delta_p u+V(x)|u|^{p-2}u=\lambda |u|^{p-2}u+|u|^{p-2}u\log|u|^p ~\text{in}~\mathbb R^N,\newline
  \displaystyle \int_{\mathbb R^N}|u|^pdx=a^p\varepsilon^N,
  \end{array}
  \right. \] where $a,\varepsilon&gt; 0$, $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ is known as the Lagrange multiplier, $\Delta_p\cdot =\text{div} (|\nabla \cdot|^{p-2}\nabla \cdot)$ denotes the usual $p$-Laplacian operator with $2\leq p &lt; N$ and $V \in \mathcal{C}^0(\mathbb R^N)$ is the potential which satisfies some suitable assumptions. We prove that the number of positive solutions depends on the profile of $V$ and each solution concentrates around its corresponding global minimum point of $V$ in the semiclassical limit when $\varepsilon\to0^+$ using variational method.
  Moreover, we also get the existence of normalized solutions for some logarithmic $p$-Laplacian equations involving mass-supercritical nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: A new characterization of convexity of a planar domain is obtained. Its derivation involves two classical facts: the Varadhan's formula, expressing the distance function with respect to the domain's boundary via real-valued solutions of the modified Helmholtz equation, and the convexity of a planar domain in which the distance function is superharmonic</description>

      <title>A general and sharp regularity condition for integro-differential equations with non-dominated measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the regularity condition (also known in the literature as structure condition) an integro-differential operator may satisfy in order for the domination principle to hold for (sub-,super-) solutions of polynomial growth. More precisely, the framework presented in Hollender [13], in which power functions are used in order to determine the integrability conditions, is weakened by substituting the power functions with Young functions. The use of Young functions allows for sharp integrability conditions, which are crucial when one deals with limit theorems. As an immediate application, it is considered the case of parabolic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) operators, for which the regularity condition is satisfied and, consequently, the comparison principle as well. The parabolic HJB operator presented in this work can be associated to second-order (decoupled) forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps.</description>

      <title>Robust a posteriori error control for the Allen-Cahn equation with variable mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a $\gamma$-robust a posteriori error estimator for finite element approximations of the Allen-Cahn equation with variable non-degenerate mobility. The estimator utilizes spectral estimates for the linearized steady part of the differential operator as well as a conditional stability estimate based on a weighted sum of Bregman distances, based on the energy and a functional related to the mobility. A suitable reconstruction of the numerical solution in the stability estimate leads to a fully computable estimator.</description>

      <title>Novel Boundary Conditions for the Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If we want to deform a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary using Ricci flow, we first need to decide on appropriate boundary conditions. We would like these conditions to reflect the geometric nature of the flow and allow for a variety of initial data. Importantly, the conditions should be compatible with the expected evolution of Einstein metrics. We propose it is natural to choose those conditions, for which the first variation of certain functionals, such as the Einstein-Hilbert action and Perelmans lambda-functional, does not admit a boundary term. We provide a proof of the short term existence of solutions of the initial boundary value problem, under these conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker--Planck evolution in the Hilbert--Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as two recent papers by Hern\'andez--Ranard--Riedel but the statement and methods are different.</description>

      <title>On function spaces for radial functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with complex Banach-space valued functions of the form $$ \hat{f}_k(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta,z)=\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} k \theta}f_k(r,z), \qquad r \in [0,\infty), \theta \in \mathbb{T}^1, z \in \mathbb{R}, $$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. It is demonstrated how classical and Sobolev spaces for the radial function $f_k$ can be constructed in a natural fashion from the corresponding standard function spaces for $\hat{f}_k$. A theory of radial distributions is derived in the same spirit. Finally, a new class of \textit{Hankel spaces} for the case $f_k=f_k(r)$ is introduced. These spaces are the radial counterparts of the familiar Bessel-potential spaces for functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$. The paper concludes with an application of the theory to the Dirichlet boundary-value problem for Poisson's equation in a cylindrical domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.08475v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and self-contained approach to establish the unique continuation property for some classical evolution equations of second order in a cylindrical domain. We namely discuss this property for wave, parabolic and Sch\"odinger operators with time-independent principal part. Our method is builds on two-parameter Carleman inequalities combined with unique continuation across a pseudo-convex hypersurface with respect to the space variable. The most results we demonstrate in this work are more or less classical. Some of them are not stated exactly as in their original form.</description>

Abstract: We consider periodic homogenization of boundary value problems for second-order semilinear elliptic systems in 2D of the type $$ \partial_{x_i}\left(a_{ij}^{\alpha \beta}(x/\varepsilon)\partial_{x_j}u(x)+b_i^\alpha(x,u(x))\right)=b^\alpha(x,u(x)) \mbox{ for } x \in \Omega. $$ For small $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we prove existence of weak solutions $u=u_\varepsilon$ as well as their local uniqueness for $\|u-u_0\|_\infty \approx 0$, where $u_0$ is a given non-degenerate weak solution to the homogenized boundary value problem, and we estimate the rate of convergence to zero of $\|u_\varepsilon-u_0\|_\infty$ for $\varepsilon \to 0$.
  Our assumptions are, roughly speaking, as follows: The functions $a_{ij}^{\alpha \beta}$ are bounded, measurable and $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic, the functions $b_i^\alpha(\cdot,u)$ and $b^\alpha(\cdot,u)$ are bounded and measurable, the functions $b_i^\alpha(x,\cdot)$ and $b^\alpha(x,\cdot)$ are $C^1$-smooth, and $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Neither global solution uniqueness is supposed nor growth restrictions of $b_i^\alpha(x,\cdot)$ or $b^\alpha(x,\cdot)$ nor higher regularity of $u_0$, and cross-diffusion is allowed.
  The main tool of the proofs is an abstract result of implicit function theorem type which in the past has been applied to singularly perturbed nonlinear ODEs and elliptic and parabolic PDEs and, hence, which permits a common approach to existence, local uniqueness and error estimates for singularly perturbed problems and and for homogenization problems.</description>

      <title>The pluricomplex Green function of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $(n-1)$-plurisubharmonic functions and form type $k$-Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the pluricomplex Green function of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $(n-1)$-plurisubharmonic functions by solving the Dirichlet problem for the form type Monge-Amp\`{e}re and Hessian equations on a punctured domain. We prove the pluricomplex Green function is $C^{1,\alpha}$ by constructing approximating solutions and establishing uniform a priori estimates for the gradient and the complex Hessian. The singular solutions turn out to be smooth for the $k$-Hessian equations for $(n-1)$-$k$-admissible functions.</description>

      <title>Exponentially localised interface eigenmodes in finite chains of resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies wave localisation in chains of finitely many resonators. There is an extensive theory predicting the existence of localised modes induced by defects in infinitely periodic systems. This work extends these principles to finite-sized systems. We consider finite systems of subwavelength resonators arranged in dimers that have a geometric defect in the structure. This is a classical wave analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for defectless finite dimer structures and find a direct relationship between eigenvalues being within the spectral gap and the localisation of their associated eigenmode. Then we show the existence and uniqueness of an eigenvalue in the gap in the defect structure, proving the existence of a unique localised interface mode. To the best of our knowledge, our method, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is the first to characterise quantitatively the localised interface modes in systems of finitely many resonators.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving approximation for the non-isothermal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and analyse a structure-preserving approximation of the non-isothermal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system using conforming finite elements in space and implicit time discretisation with convex-concave splitting. The system is first reformulated into a variational form which reveal the structure of the equations, which is then used in the subsequent approximation.</description>
