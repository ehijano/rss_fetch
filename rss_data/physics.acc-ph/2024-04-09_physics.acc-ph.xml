      <title>Design, fabrication and test of a 5 GHz klystron based on the kladistron principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new bunching method, named "kladistron" has been developed at CEA in order to provide high efficiency klystrons. A first "kladistron" prototype was designed and realized. It was adapted from the 4.9 GHz TH2166 from Thales, where the interaction line was transformed from 6 to 16 cavities. The design and fabrication phases of this prototype are developed in this paper. The kladistron prototype was tested in Thales facility. Its efficiency is finally lower (41 %) than expected (55 %), moreover it presents a spurious oscillation at 4.96 GHz. After analysis of the experimental results, it is concluded that the discrepancy between design and real frequencies is the cause for the low efficiency while the spurious oscillation results from a high gain peak at 4.96 GHz.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Algorithms for Accelerator Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accelerator physics relies on numerical algorithms to solve optimization problems in online accelerator control and tasks such as experimental design and model calibration in simulations. The effectiveness of optimization algorithms in discovering ideal solutions for complex challenges with limited resources often determines the problem complexity these methods can address. The accelerator physics community has recognized the advantages of Bayesian optimization algorithms, which leverage statistical surrogate models of objective functions to effectively address complex optimization challenges, especially in the presence of noise during accelerator operation and in resource-intensive physics simulations. In this review article, we offer a conceptual overview of applying Bayesian optimization techniques towards solving optimization problems in accelerator physics. We begin by providing a straightforward explanation of the essential components that make up Bayesian optimization techniques. We then give an overview of current and previous work applying and modifying these techniques to solve accelerator physics challenges. Finally, we explore practical implementation strategies for Bayesian optimization algorithms to maximize their performance, enabling users to effectively address complex optimization challenges in real-time beam control and accelerator design.</description>

      <title>Muon Ring and FCC-ee / CEPC Based Antimuon-Electron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>
