      <title>$\text{AdS}_4$ Holography and the Hilbert Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate a holographic relationship between the enumerative geometry of the Hilbert scheme of $N$ points in the plane $\mathbb{C}^2$, with $N$ large, and the entropy of certain magnetically charged black holes with $\text{AdS}_4$ asymptotics. Specifically, we demonstrate how the entropy functional arises from the asymptotics of 't Hooft and Wilson line operators in a 3d $\mathcal{N}= 4$ gauge theory. The gauge-Bethe correspondence allows us to interpret this calculation in terms of the enumerative geometry of the Hilbert scheme and thereby conjecture that the entropy is saturated by expectation values of certain natural operators in the quantum $K$-theory ring acting on the localised $K$-theory of the Hilbert scheme. We give numerical evidence that the large $N$ limit is saturated by contributions from a certain vacuum/fixed point on the Hilbert scheme, associated to a particular triangular-shaped Young diagram, by evolving solutions to the Bethe equations numerically at finite (but large) $N$ towards the classical limit. We thus conjecture a concrete geometric holographic dual of the so-called gravitational/Cardy block.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Integrating out the fermions in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Not much is known about superstring scattering amplitudes in curved backgrounds. Using the hybrid formalism in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ with pure NS-NS three-form flux, we compute a $\rm PSU(1,1|2)$-covariant three-point amplitude for half-BPS vertex operators inserted in the $\rm AdS_3$ boundary and show that it agrees with the RNS computation. The zero-mode prescription for the fermions in $\rm AdS$ is defined in terms of the ``standard'' spacetime SUSY generator. It is found that integrating out the fermionic worldsheet fields in the path integral gives rise to the target-space vielbein, which explicitly encodes that the conformal group on the boundary is identified with the symmetry group of the $\rm AdS$ bulk.</description>

      <title>A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Designer bubble walls in a holographic Weyl semi-metal with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bubble walls in the holographic D3/probe D7 system that is dual to strongly coupled quark dynamics. We work to construct holographic descriptions of bubble wall junctions where we can tune the bubble wall height and pressure difference in a theory at zero temperature and density. We study the system in the presence of a background axial vector field b that induces a Weyl semi-metal, massless phase and a background magnetic field B which favours mass generation. We find a first order transition line in the mass-$B$ plane, at fixed b, ending at a critical point. We present some preliminary solutions of PDEs that describe the motion of one dimensional bubble walls in this theory, with a stationary initial condition - large pressure differences accelerate the wall to the speed of light whilst when the pressure difference is small the wall slumps to an interpolating solution. We also take the first steps to include temperature and see evidence of thermal drag slowing the wall motion. Slump configurations at finite temperature show some signs of a back pressure wave against the wall motion.</description>

      <title>A Holographic Construction of MHV Graviton Amplitudes in Celestial CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that tree-level MHV $n$-graviton amplitudes, when analytically continued to Klein space, can be holographically generated as the correlators of a two-dimensional conformal field theory ($2d$ CFT) in the large-$N$ semiclassical $b\rightarrow0$ limit. This $2d$ CFT is composed of a Liouville field theory, coupled to a level-one $SO\left(N\right)$ Kac-Moody current, and a doublet of free fermions residing on $\mathbf{CP}^{1}$.</description>

      <title>Confined phases at finite density in the Hardwall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AdS/QCD models are being extensively studied because they seem to offer an entirely tractable and radically different approach to the phases of QCD whose region of validity is precisely the region of strong interactions. In this context, a missing ingredient has been the absence of a bulk description dual to a confined hadronic phase at finite baryon density. In this work, we discuss a class of backgrounds that fill this lacuna. Applying physically motivated boundary conditions, we obtain phase diagrams which compare reasonably with approaches based on the PNJL model. We also show that such backgrounds can play a similar role in geometries with a dilaton field.</description>

      <title>Commutator technique for the heat kernel of minimal higher derivative operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a new technique of the asymptotic heat kernel expansion for minimal higher derivative operators of a generic $2M$-th order, $F(\nabla)=(-\Box)^M+\cdots$, in the background field formalism of gauge theories and quantum gravity. This technique represents the conversion of the recently suggested Fourier integral method of generalized exponential functions [Phys. Rev. D105, 065013 (2022), arXiv:2112.03062] into the commutator algebra of special differential operators, which allows one to express expansion coefficients for $F(\nabla)$ in terms of the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of a minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$. This procedure is based on special functorial properties of the formalism including the Mellin-Barnes representation of the complex operator power $H^M(\nabla)$ and naturally leads to the origin of generalized exponential functions without directly appealing to the Fourier integral method. The algorithm is essentially more straightforward than the Fourier method and consists of three steps ready for computer codification by symbolic manipulation programs. They begin with the decomposition of the operator into a power of some minimal second order operator $H(\nabla)$ and its lower derivative "perturbation part" $W(\nabla)$, $F(\nabla)=H^M(\nabla)+W(\nabla)$, followed by considering their multiple nested commutators. The second step is the construction of special local differential operators -- the perturbation theory in powers of the lower derivative part $W(\nabla)$. The final step is the so-called procedure of their {\em syngification} consisting in a special modification of the covariant derivative monomials in these operators by Synge world function $\sigma(x,x')$ with their subsequent action on the HaMiDeW coefficients of $H(\nabla)$.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the "strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT, $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Phase time and Ehrenfest's theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite inner product from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axions from Higher-Form Symmetries in Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extra-dimensional axion solves the strong CP problem while largely circumventing the quality problem that plagues its four-dimensional counterparts. Such high quality can be clearly understood in terms of the generalized global symmetries of the higher-dimensional theory. We emphasize that an electric one-form symmetry is entirely responsible for protecting the potential of axions arising from 5D gauge theories and use this to systematically characterize the extra-dimensional axion quality problem. We identify three ways of breaking this one-form symmetry to generate an axion potential: adding electrically charged matter, gauging a magnetic higher-form symmetry, and turning on an ABJ anomaly. In the latter case, we identify new ways of generating an axion potential via extra-dimensional magnetic monopoles. We also discuss how the axion is modified if the protective electric one-form symmetry is itself gauged. Finally, we relate these effects to gravitational expectations for the quality problem via generalized weak gravity conjectures. The clarity that generalized symmetries bring to the extra-dimensional axion quality problem highlights their relevance to particle phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking, gauge hierarchy and electroweak vacuum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called metastability bound asserts that an unnaturally small Higgs mass is a necessary condition for electroweak vacuum metastability, offering a new approach towards solving the hierarchy problem. So far, this result relies on the assumption of a negative Higgs mass parameter, or equivalently, on electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a new, corresponding bound for the case of a positive mass parameter. When the new bound is significantly more restrictive than or comparable to its established counterpart, it may offer an explanation for the sign of the Higgs mass parameter, and thus, spontaneous symmetry breaking itself. New physics at scales $\mathcal{O} (1-10)$ TeV can lower these bounds as far as the TeV-scale. As an illustration, we consider vacuum stability in the presence of additional TeV-scale fermions with Yukawa couplings to the Higgs, as well as a dimension-six term parameterizing new physics in the UV. This scenario requires new physics that couples strongly to the Higgs, and can potentially be probed at future colliders. Finally, to allow for comparison with concrete mechanisms predicting metastability, we provide the mass-dependent lifetime of the electroweak vacuum for this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the low-energy dynamics of gap-between-jets cross sections at hadron colliders, for which phase factors in the hard amplitudes spoil collinear cancellations and lead to double (``super-leading'') logarithmic behavior. Based on a method-of-regions analysis, we identify three-loop contributions from perturbative active-active Glauber-gluon exchanges with the right structure to render the cross section consistent with PDF factorization below the gap veto scale. The Glauber contributions we identify are unambiguously defined without regulators beyond dimensional regularization.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising model. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensor with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D- early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr- AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4$He anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes</description>

Abstract: Parameters in an effective field theory can be subject to certain positivity bounds if one requires a UV completion that obeys the fundamental principles of quantum field theory. These bounds are relatively straight forward at the tree level, but would become more obscure when loop effects are important. Using scalar theories as examples, we carefully exam the positivity bounds in a case where the leading contribution to a forward elastic amplitude arises at the one-loop level, and point out certain subtleties in terms of the implications of positivity bounds on the theory parameter space. In particular, the one-loop generated dimension-8 operator coefficients (that would be positive if generated at the tree level), as well as their $\beta$-functions are generally not subject to positivity bounds as they might correspond to interference terms of the cross sections under the optical theorem, which could have either sign. A strict positivity bound can only be implied when all contributions at the same loop order are considered, including the ones from dim-4 and dim-6 operator coefficients, which have important effects at the one-loop level. Our results may have important implications on the robustness of experimental tests of positivity bounds.</description>

Abstract: While it is possible to estimate the dark matter density at the Sun distance from the galactic center, this does not give information on actual dark matter density in the Solar system. There can be considerable local enhancement of dark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun, the Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for the formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies the possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter masses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft missions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic and molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to gigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive comagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Charging the Love numbers: Charged scalar response coefficients of Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electrically-charged massless scalar response to the general Kerr-Newman black hole and obtain the exact (complex) response coefficients, whose real parts are the Love numbers. We find there is a curious discontinuity between the neutral and charged scalar. The Love numbers vanish for the neutral scalar, but are inversely proportional to the electric charge of the scalar in the small charge limit. We study the near-zone of the dynamical equation with non-vanishing frequency $\omega$, and show that the system have an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ Love-like symmetry. The symmetry selects a special frequency $\omega_{\rm cr}$, which vanishes in the neutral case, so that the real part of the response coefficient vanishes identically. We also generalize the results into higher dimensions to some extend.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Symmetry-Protected Signature of 3-body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and characterizing multi-body interactions in quantum processes remains a significant challenge. This is partly because 2-body interactions can produce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the universality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However, when an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle number conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected signature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot mimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of 3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This technique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires probing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace that scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the family of Feynman integrals related to the H-graph with unequal masses in relativistic quantum field theory. We present an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for the 40 master integrals. The alphabet consists of 29 dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, involving six square roots. As these square roots are not simultaneously rationalizable, we express the master integrals in terms of iterated integrals. In addition, we express the H-graph with unit powers of the propagators up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms in compact form.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a complete proof of the so-called First On-Shell Theorem that determines dynamical content of the unfolded equations for free symmetric massless fields of arbitrary integer spin in any dimension and arbitrary integer or half-integer spin in four dimensions. This is achieved by calculation of the respective $\sigma_-$ cohomology both in the tensor language in Minkowski space of any dimension and in terms of spinors in $AdS_4$. In the $d$-dimensional case $H^p(\sigma_-)$ is computed for any $p$ and interpretation of $H^p(\sigma_-)$ is given both for the original Fronsdal system and for the associated systems of higher form fields.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotically massless towers of species are ubiquitous in the string landscape when infinite-distance limits are approached. Due to the remarkable properties of string dualities, they always comprise Kaluza-Klein states or higher-spin excitations of weakly coupled, asymptotically tensionless critical strings. The connection between towers of light species and small black holes warrants seeking a bottom-up rationale for this dichotomoy, dubbed emergent string conjecture. In this paper we move a first step in this direction, exploring bottom-up constraints on towers of light species motivated purely from the consistency of the corresponding thermodynamic picture for small black holes. These constraints shed light on the allowed towers in quantum gravity, and, upon combining them with unitarity and causality constraints from perturbative graviton scattering, they provide evidence for the emergent string scenario with no reference to a specific ultraviolet completion.</description>

Abstract: Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</description>

Abstract: We construct a candidate tree-level gravitational Compton amplitude for a rotating Kerr black hole, for any quantum spin s=0,1/2,1,...,$\infty$, from which we extract the corresponding classical amplitude to all orders in the spin vector $S^\mu$. We use multiple insights from massive higher-spin quantum field theory, such as massive gauge invariance and improved behavior in the massless limit. A chiral-field approach is particularly helpful in ensuring correct degrees of freedom, and for writing down compact off-shell interactions for general spin. The simplicity of the interactions is echoed in the structure of the spin-s Compton amplitude, for which we use homogeneous symmetric polynomials of the spin variables. Where possible, we compare to the general-relativity results in the literature, available up to eighth order in spin.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Non-Invertible Symmetries in (1+1)d: Gapped and Gapless Phases, Transitions, and Symmetry TFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fermionic non-invertible symmetries in (1+1)d, which are generalized global symmetries that mix fermion parity symmetry with other invertible and non-invertible internal symmetries. Such symmetries are described by fermionic fusion supercategories, which are fusion $\pi$-supercategories with a choice of fermion parity. The aim of this paper is to flesh out the categorical Landau paradigm for fermionic symmetries. We use the formalism of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study possible gapped and gapless phases for such symmetries, along with possible deformations between these phases, which are organized into a Hasse phase diagram. The phases can be characterized in terms of sets of condensed, confined and deconfined generalized symmetry charges, reminiscent of notions familiar from superconductivity. Many of the gapless phases also serve as phase transitions between gapped phases. The associated fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) can be obtained by performing generalized fermionic Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations on bosonic CFTs describing simpler transitions. The fermionic non-invertible symmetries along with their charges and phases discussed here can be obtained from those of bosonic non-invertible symmetries via fermionization or Jordan-Wigner transformation, which is discussed in detail.</description>

Abstract: The quantum kinetic equation for the gauge-invariant Wigner function, constructed from spinor fields that obey the Dirac equation modified by CPT and Lorentz symmetry-violating terms, is presented. The equations for the components of the Wigner function in the Clifford algebra basis are accomplished. Focusing on the massless case, an extended semiclassical chiral kinetic theory in the presence of external electromagnetic fields is developed. We calculate the chiral currents and establish the anomalous magnetic and separation effects in a Lorentz-violating background. The chiral anomaly within the context of extended quantum electrodynamics is elucidated. Finally, we derive the semiclassical Lorentz-violating extended chiral transport equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our study of integrable structures in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ to a broad class of theories called the generalized QCD, which are given by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}\propto {\rm tr}\,B\wedge F- {\rm tr}\,V(B)$ coupled to quarks in the fundamental representation. We recast the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the meson spectrum into a TQ-Baxter equation and determine a transfer matrix in a closed form for any given polynomial $V(B)$. Using this reformulation, we derive the asymptotic expansion of energy levels and wavefunctions. Examining the analytic structure of the spectrum as a function of the coefficients of $V(B)$, we determine the region of couplings where the theory admits a positive and discrete spectrum of mesons. Furthermore, we uncover a multi-sheeted structure with infinitely many multi-critical points, where several mesons become simultaneously massless. Lastly, we illustrate that this structure persists in the large-representation limit of the generalized QCD with the SU(2) gauge group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

These ensembles are: fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,C)$, fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p,C)$,fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p,C)$,fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$ and fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles. Here $\varphi$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\Omega$, $\mathcal{J}$, $p$, $\mathcal{V}$, $C$ and $\mu$ denotes the electric potential, electric charge, angular velocity, angular momentum, CFT pressure, CFT volume, central charge, and chemical potential respectively. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we observe a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. In the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble, we again find a first-order phase transition for $\mathcal{Q}&lt;\mathcal{Q}_{crit}$, $\Omega&lt;\Omega_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. The fixed $(\varphi,\Omega,\mathcal{V}, C)$ ensemble is characterized by a confinement/de-confinement phase transition. In the fixed $(\varphi,\mathcal{J},\mathcal{V},C)$ ensemble, we see a first order phase transition for $\mathcal{J}&lt;\mathcal{J}_{crit}$, $\varphi&lt;\varphi_{crit}$ and $C&gt;C_{crit}$. Finally, in the fixed $(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\Omega,p, C)$,$(\varphi,\mathcal{J},p, C)$,$(\mathcal{Q},\mathcal{J},p,\mu)$,$(\varphi,\Omega,p,\mu)$ ensembles, we do not observe any critical behavior or phase transition.</description>

      <title>Topological equivalence and phase transition rate in holographic thermodynamics of regularized Maxwell theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the holographic dictionary from the proposal that treats Newton's constant as a thermodynamic variable, we establish a thermodynamic topological equivalence between the AdS black holes in the bulk and the thermal states in the dual CFT. The findings further reveal that the thermodynamic topological characteristics of the RegMax AdS black holes are strongly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the regularized Maxwell theory. Additionally, we investigate the phase transition between low and high entropy thermal states within a canonical ensemble in the dual CFT. Our observations indicate that the phase transition behavior of the thermal states mirrors that of the black holes. By modeling the phase transition process as a stochastic process, we are able to calculate the rates of phase transition between the thermal states. This result enhances our understanding of the dominant processes involved in the phase transition of the thermal states in the dual CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of the inspiral process of a binary system producing gravitational waves can be described by perturbation theory. At the third post-Minkowskian order a two-loop double box graph, known as H-graph contributes. We consider the case where the two objects making up the binary system have equal masses. We express all master integrals related to the equal-mass H-graph up to weight four in terms of multiple polylogarithms. We provide a numerical program which evaluates all master integrals up to weight four in the physical regions with arbitrary precision.</description>

      <title>Twisted geometries are area-metric geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometry arising in Loop Quantum Gravity has been known to semi-classically lead to generalizations of length-geometries. There have been several attempts to interpret these so called twisted geometries and understand their role and fate in the continuum limit of the spin foam approach to quantum gravity. In this paper we offer a new perspective on this issue by showing that the twisted geometry of a 4-simplex can be understood as arising from an area-metric (in contrast to the more particular length-metric). Such equivalence allows us to define notions like signature, generalized triangle inequalities and parallel transport for twisted geometries (now understood in a 4-dimensional setting), exemplifying how it provides a new handle to understand them. Furthermore, it offers a new microscopic understanding of spin foam geometries which is notably supported by recent studies of the continuum effective dynamics of spin foams.</description>

Abstract: This review is a contribution to a book dedicated to the memory of Michael E. Fisher. The first example of a quantum many body system not expected to have any quasiparticle excitations was the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory. The absence of quasiparticles can be established in the compressible, metallic state of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of fermions with random interactions. The solvability of the latter model has enabled numerous computations of the non-quasiparticle dynamics of chaotic many-body states, such as those expected to describe quantum black holes. We review thermodynamic properties of the SYK model, and describe how they have led to an understanding of the universal structure of the low energy density of states of charged black holes without low energy supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian curvature identities on almost Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold and generalized Ricci solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05001v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is observed that on a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold the Nijenhuis tensor is parallel with respect to the torsion connection. If the torsion is closed then the space is a compact generalized gradient Ricci soliton. In this case, the torsion connection is Ricci-flat if and only if either the norm of the torsion or the Riemannian scalar curvature is constant. On a compact almost complex Calabi-Yau with torsion 6-manifold it is shown that the curvature of the torsion connection is symmetric on exchange of the first and the second pairs and has vanishing Ricci tensor if and only if it satisfies the Riemannian first Bianchi identity.</description>

      <title>Large $N_c$ QCD phase diagram at $\mu_B = 0$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07333v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice studies suggest that at zero baryon chemical potential and increasing temperature there are three characteristic regimes in QCD that are connected by smooth analytical crossovers: a hadron gas regime at T &lt; T_ch ~ 155 MeV, an intermediate regime, called stringy fluid, at T_ch &lt; T &lt; ~ 3 T_ch, and a quark-gluon plasma regime at higher temperatures. These regimes have been interpreted to reflect different approximate symmetries and effective degrees of freedom. In the hadron gas the effective degrees of freedom are hadrons and the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD is spontaneously broken. The intermediate regime has been interpreted as lacking spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking along with the emergence of new approximate symmetry, chiral spin symmetry, that is not a symmetry of the Dirac Lagrangian, but is a symmetry of the confining part of the QCD Lagrangian. While the high temperature regime is the usual quark-gluon plasma which is often considered to reflect "deconfinement" in some way. This paper explores the behavior of these regimes of QCD as the number of colors in the theory, N_c, gets large. In the large N_c limit the theory is center-symmetric and notions of confinement and deconfinement are unambiguous. The energy density is O(N_c^0) in the meson gas, O(N_c^1) in the intermediate regime and O(N_c^2) in the quark-gluon plasma regime. In the large N_c limit these regimes may become distinct phases separated by first order phase transitions. The intermediate phase has the peculiar feature that glueballs should exist and have properties that are unchanged from what is seen in the vacuum (up to 1/N_c corrections), while the ordinary dilute gas of mesons with broken chiral symmetry disappears and approximate chiral spin symmetry should emerge.</description>

      <title>Induced Cosmological Anisotropies and CMB Anomalies by a non-Abelian Gauge-Gravity Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-abelian cousin of the model presented in \cite{Lee:2022rtz} which induces cosmological anisotropies on top of standard FLRW geometry. This is in some sense doing a cosmological mean field approximation, where the mean field cosmological model under consideration would be the standard FLRW, and the induced anisotropies are small perturbative corrections on top of it. Here we mostly focus on the non-abelian $SU(2)$ gauge fields coupled to the gravity to generate the anisotropies, which can be a viable model for the axion-like particle (ALP) dark sector. The induced anisotropies are consequences of the non-trivial back-reaction of the gauge fields on the gravity sector, and by a clever choice of the parametrization, one can generate the Bianchi model we have studied in this note. We also show that the anisotropies influence the Sachs-Wolfe effect and we discuss the implications.</description>

      <title>De Sitter horizon entropy from a simplicial Lorentzian path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimension of the Hilbert space of a quantum gravitational system can be written formally as a path integral partition function over Lorentzian metrics. We implement this in a 2+1 dimensional simplicial minisuperspace model in which the system is a spatial topological disc, and recover by contour deformation through a Euclidean saddle the entropy of the de Sitter static patch, up to discretization artifacts. The model illustrates the importance of integration over both positive and negative lapse to enforce the gravitational constraints, and of restriction to complex metrics for which the fluctuation integrals would converge. Although a strictly Lorentzian path integral is oscillatory, an exponentially large partition function results from unavoidable imaginary contributions to the action. These arise from analytic continuation of the simplicial (Regge) action for configurations with codimension-2 simplices where the metric fails to be Lorentzian. In particular, the dominant contribution comes from configurations with contractible closed timelike curves that encircle the boundary of the disc, in close correspondence with recent continuum results.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chae's analyses on GAIA observations of wide binary stars have fortified the paradigm of extended gravity with particular attention to MOND-like theories. We recall that, starting from the origin of Einstein's general relativity, the request of Mach on the structure of the theory has been the core of the foundational debate. This issue is strictly connected with the nature of the mass-energy equivalence. This was exactly the key point that Einstein used to derive the same general relativity. On the other hand, the current requirements of particle physics and the open questions within extended gravity theories, which have recently been further strengthened by analyses of GAIA observations, request a better understanding of the Equivalence Principle. By considering a direct coupling between the Ricci curvature scalar and the matter Lagrangian a non geodesic ratio between the inertial and the gravitational mass can be fixed and MOND-like theories are retrieved at low energies.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution in Canonical Quantum Gravity is Trivial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wheeler-DeWitt equation does not describe any explicit time evolution of the wave function, and somehow related to this issue, there is no natural way of defining an invariant inner product that provides a viable probability interpretation. We show that both of these difficulties are solved in a covariant canonical formulation of general relativity where the configuration space is extended by introducing the embedding coordinates as dynamical variables. The formalism describes the evolution of the wave function from one spacelike slice to another, but as in the case of spatial diffeomorphisms this is simply implemented by a coordinate change in the wave function. We demonstrate how the time equation disappears after gauge fixing that removes the embedding coordinates. These findings indicate that the time evolution is trivial in a background independent formulation of quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for \(SU(N)\) Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>
