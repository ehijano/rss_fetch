      <title>Recent results from MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling and reconstructing neutrino-nucleus scattering is difficult, but it is crucial to do it precisely to enable next-generation oscillation measurements. Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs), such as MicroBooNE, can be the tool for this job as they are excellent precision neutrino detectors with their ability to produce detailed three-dimensional interaction images and precise energy and spatial resolution. MicroBooNE currently possesses the world's largest neutrino-argon scattering data set collected over five years using the BNB and NuMI neutrino beams at Fermilab. The experiment has performed measurements over a broad range of physics topics including neutrino argon cross sections, searches for BSM physics, and investigations of the MiniBooNE LEE excess. Many of these measurements are essential for improving the modelling of nuclear effects for both MicroBooNE and future LArTPC neutrino experiments, such as DUNE. This talk will give an overview of recent MicroBooNE results, the analysis techniques that enable them, and prospects for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Synchronous and asynchronous Data Quality Control of the ALICE Inner Tracking System in the LHC Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor technology application in high-energy physics. The upgraded version of the tracking system, called ITS2, consists of seven concentric layers of ALPIDE monolithic active pixel sensors produced in the 180 nm CMOS process, covering a total sensitive area of about 10 m${}^2$. The ALPIDE sensor features a pixel pitch of 27 $\mu$m $\times$ 29 $\mu$m and a position resolution of about 5 $\mu$m. The very low material budget, 0.36\% $X_{0}$/layer for the three innermost layers and 1.10\% $X_{0}$/layer for the outer layers, in combination with the small radial distance of only 23 mm from the beam, leads to an excellent impact parameter resolution at low transverse momentum. This makes the detector well suited for experimentally challeging physics measurements such as the reconstruction of low transverse momentum heavy-flavor particles in the heavy-ion collision environment. This contribution provides an overview of the ITS2 data Quality Control system (QC), a framework designed to synchronously monitor the detector operating parameters and provide asynchronous reconstruction of the collected data, with the goal of guaranteeing a stable and efficient data taking. The monitoring for fake-hit rate, front-end electronics status, data integrity, cluster and track distributions, are presented, together with an overview of the ITS2 performance during the recent Run 3 pp and Pb--Pb data taking campaigns, as extracted from the QC asynchronous reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hadronic Uncertainty in Low-Energy Neutral-Current Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dominant hadronic uncertainty in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ per mille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a one-loop $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering to the sub-permille level, $\lesssim 1$ per mille.</description>

      <title>Multi-step Strong First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Inverted Type-I 2HDM: Parameter Space, Gravitational Waves, and Collider Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model under the inverted Higgs scenario, where the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson corresponds to the heavier \textit{CP}-even scalar. We systematically map the parameter space viable for strong first-order EWPTs (SFOEWPTs) under current theoretical and experimental constraints, revealing that such transitions can occur through one-step, two-step, and rarely three-step pathways with distinct phenomenological characteristics. One-step transitions confine $m_{H^\pm}$ to $[295, 441]{\;{\rm GeV}}$ and $\tan\beta$ to $[4.2, 8.8]$, whereas two-step transitions allow broader ranges: $m_{H^\pm} \in [100, 350]{\;{\rm GeV}}$ and $\tan\beta \in [2.5, 45.4]$. Notably, SFOEWPTs involving negative $\sin (\beta-\alpha)$ appear almost exclusively in the one-step case, offering a potential discriminator. This study also provides the first detailed calculation of LISA gravitational wave (GW) signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for multi-step SFOEWPTs in this scenario, finding that detectable GW signals (SNR $&gt;10$) predominantly arise from two-step transitions. Furthermore, we show that while a correlation between the vacuum uplifting measure $\Delta {F}_0$ and EWPT strength $\xi_c$ is affirmed for one-step transitions, this correlation breaks down for multi-step pathways. Finally, we conduct the first dedicated collider analysis at the 1.5 TeV CLIC for representative benchmark points supporting an SFOEWPT, identifying $e^+ e^- \to H^+H^- \to W^+ W^- hh$ as a promising discovery channel. We emphasize the enhancement of $\text{Br}(h \to \gamma\gamma)$ for negative $\sin(\beta-\alpha)$ and propose two golden final states, $W^+ W^- b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ and $W^+ W^- b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$, with negligible backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Modelling Coincident Particle Production in Ultraperipheral Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of coincident particle production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. In particular, we present the first detailed and differential predictions for coincident $\rho^0$ meson production in association with muon pair production, motivated by the recent ATLAS measurement of this process. These are found to describe the data well, including the dependence of the coincidence fraction on the ZDC selection and/or other kinematic constraints on the muons. Differential predictions at the level of various kinematic variables are presented, and the calculation is made publicly available in the SuperChic MC generator. We also present general results for coincident two photon-initiated production, focussing on muon and electron pair production; while the former is rather suppressed, the latter will be ubiquitous near threshold. The impact of coincident production on exclusivity vetos in ultraperipheral measurements is discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics and Computing Performance of the EggNet Tracking Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle track reconstruction is traditionally computationally challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the tracking algorithms employed. Recent developments have focused on novel algorithms with graph neural networks (GNNs), which can improve scalability. While most of these GNN-based methods require an input graph to be constructed before performing message passing, a one-shot approach called EggNet that directly takes detector spacepoints as inputs and iteratively apply graph attention networks with an evolving graph structure has been proposed. The graphs are gradually updated to improve the edge efficiency and purity, thus providing a better model performance. In this work, we evaluate the physics and computing performance of the EggNet tracking pipeline on the full TrackML dataset. We also explore different techniques to reduce constraints on computation memory and computing time.</description>

      <title>Develoment of thin high-pressure-laminate RPC electrodes for future high-energy experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this R&amp;D, an innovative method for producing thin high-pressure laminate (HPL) electrodes for resistive plate chambers (RPC) for future high-energy experiments is introduced. Instead of using thick phenolic HPL (2-mm thick Bakelite), which has been used for conventional RPC triggers, the RPC electrodes in the present study are constructed by bonding 500 {\mu}m-thick melamine-based HPL to a graphite-coated polycarbonate plate. A double-gap RPC prototype to demostrate the present technology has been constructed and tested for cosmic muons. Furthermore, the uniform detector characteristrics shown in the test result allows us to explore the present technology in future high-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulation of MAPS and a MAPS-based Inner Tracker for the Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a promising detector candidate for the inner tracker of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). To evaluate the performance of MAPS and the MAPS-based inner tracker, a dedicated simulation workflow has been developed, offering essential insights for detector design and optimization.
  The intrinsic characteristics of MAPS, designed using several fabrication processes and pixel geometries, were investigated through a combination of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were conducted with both minimum ionizing particles and $^{55}$Fe X-rays to assess critical parameters such as detection efficiency, cluster size, spatial resolution, and charge collection efficiency. Based on these evaluations, a MAPS sensor featuring a strip-like pixel and a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is selected as the baseline sensor design for the STCF inner tracker due to its excellent performance.
  Using this optimized MAPS design, a three-layer MAPS-based inner tracker was modeled and simulated. The simulation demonstrated an average detection efficiency exceeding 99%, spatial resolutions of 44.8$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $z$ direction and 8.2$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $r-\phi$ direction, and an intrinsic sensor time resolution of 5.9ns for 1GeV/c $\mu^-$ particles originating from the interaction point. These promising results suggest that the MAPS-based inner tracker fulfills the performance requirements of the STCF experiment.</description>

      <title>The precision measurement of the electron anti-neutrino spectrum in beta-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ electron antineutrino source is one of the most suitable radiochemical sources for experiments searching for the oscillations of active neutrinos to the light sterile state. In the current work the $\beta$-spectra of $\rm{^{144}Ce - ^{144}Pr}$ source have been measured by two types of $\beta$-spectrometers based on silicon Si(Li) detectors in order to determine the energy spectrum of electron anti-neutrino emitted in the $\beta$-decay of $\rm{^{144}Pr}$ nuclei. The nuclear form factor of the ground state beta transition in $\rm{^{144}Pr - ^{144}Nd}$ has been obtained with high precision: $C(W) = 1 + (-0.0279\pm 0.0003)W + (-0.076\pm 0.003)W^{-1}$. The reduced cross section for the inverse beta decay reaction on hydrogen for the $\rm{{^{144}Pr}}$ electron anti-neutrino source has been defined as $\rm{(4.7448 \pm 0.0006_{stat} \pm 0.012_{syst}) \times 10^{-44}~cm^2 {decay}^{-1}}$ that provides sufficient sensitivity to search for a sterile neutrino with a mass of $m_4 \sim 1$~eV and a mixing angle $Sin^2(2\theta_{14}) \sim 0.005$ using standard disappearance method.</description>

      <title>Event Topology Classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event classifiers are the most fundamental observables to probe the system size and event topology of high-energy collisions. Significant progress has been made to establish suitable event classifiers to probe different physics processes occurring in elementary $e^{+}e^{-}$ to heavy-ion collisions in a range of center of mass energies. One of the major motivations to revisit event classifiers at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) originates from the recent measurements of high multiplicity proton-proton collisions, which have revealed that these small collision systems exhibit features similar to the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), traditionally believed to be only achievable in heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. To pinpoint the origin of these QGP-like phenomena with substantially reduced auto-correlation and selection biases, and to bring all collision systems on equal footing, along with charged-particle multiplicity, lately several event topology classifiers such as transverse sphericity, transverse spherocity, relative transverse activity classifier, and charged-particle flattenicity have been used extensively in experiments as well as in the phenomenological front. In this review article, we extensively discuss the purpose, coverage, and usage guidelines of these event shape classifiers, which can be crucial given the upcoming measurements in a precision era during Runs 3 and 4 of the LHC. In most cases, the event shape observables are found to be better probes in understanding the heavy-ion-like behavior seen at the LHC, while making a multi-differential study of multihadron production dynamics in hadronic and nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic search for dijet resonances with anomalous jet substructure in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a model-agnostic search for narrow resonances in the dijet final state in the mass range 1.8-6 TeV. The signal is assumed to produce jets with substructure atypical of jets initiated by light quarks or gluons, with minimal additional assumptions. Search regions are obtained by utilizing multivariate machine-learning methods to select jets with anomalous substructure. A collection of complementary anomaly detection methods - based on unsupervised, weakly supervised, and semisupervised algorithms - are used in order to maximize the sensitivity to unknown new physics signatures. These algorithms are applied to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excesses above background expectations are seen. Exclusion limits are derived on the production cross section of benchmark signal models varying in resonance mass, jet mass, and jet substructure. Many of these signatures have not been previously sought, making several of the limits reported on the corresponding benchmark models the first ever. When compared to benchmark inclusive and substructure-based search strategies, the anomaly detection methods are found to significantly enhance the sensitivity to a variety of models.</description>

      <title>Test of lepton flavour universality in $W$-boson decays into electrons and $\tau$-leptons using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement of the ratio of the branching fractions, $R_{\tau/e} = B(W \to \tau \nu)/ B(W \to e \nu)$, is performed using a sample of $W$ bosons originating from top-quark decays to final states containing $\tau$-leptons or electrons. This measurement uses $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider during Run 2, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The $W \to \tau \nu_\tau$ (with $\tau \to e \nu_e \nu_\tau$) and $W \to e \nu_e$ decays are distinguished using the differences in the impact parameter distributions and transverse momentum spectra of the electrons. The measured ratio of branching fractions $R_{\tau/e} = 0.975 \pm 0.012 \textrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.020 \textrm{(syst.)}$, is consistent with the Standard Model assumption of lepton flavour universality in $W$-boson decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of Standard Model neutrino tridents involving tau leptons at the near detectors of accelerator neutrino facilities. The rates of these processes were previously thought to be negligible, even at future facilities. Our full $2\to 4$ calculation, including both coherent and incoherent scatterings, reveals that the DUNE near detector could observe a considerable number of tau tridents, which is an important background to new physics searches. We identify promising kinematic features that may allow distinction of tau tridents from the usual neutrino charged-current background at DUNE, and thus establish the observation of tau tridents for the first time. We also comment on the detection prospects at other accelerator and collider neutrino experiments.</description>

Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Coupled-channel study of $4S$-$3D$ mixing dynamics in $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among charmoniumlike $XYZ$ states, the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$ states have emerged as key candidates for exploring the charmonium spectrum. In this work, we propose a $4S$-$3D$ charmonium mixing scheme for the $\psi(4220)$ and $\psi(4380)$, induced by coupled-channel effects. By constructing a coupled-channel model, we identify the dynamical mechanism responsible for the large mixing angle observed in previous studies, which cannot be explained by conventional potential models alone. Our analysis reveals that the $DD_1$ channel significantly influences the lower state ($\psi(4220)$), while the $D^*D_1$ channel primarily affects the higher state ($\psi(4380)$). Furthermore, we investigate the two-body Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI)-allowed strong decay behaviors of these states, providing insights into their total widths. This study not only supports the $4S$-$3D$ mixing scheme but also offers a deeper understanding of the role of coupled channels in shaping the charmonium spectrum above 4 GeV. Our results align with experimental observations and provide a framework for interpreting future data on charmonium states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Logic Spectroscopy of an Electron and Positron for Precise Tests of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring fully-heavy tetraquarks through the CGAN framework: Mass and width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully-heavy tetraquark states, $QQ\bar{Q}\bar{Q} (Q=c,b)$, have garnered significant attention both experimentally and theoretically, due to their unique properties and potential to provide new insights into Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In this study, we employ Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to predict the masses and decay widths of fully-heavy tetraquarks. To deepen our understanding of heavy multiquark structures, we prepare datasets based on two distinct approaches and train the CGAN model using both. The CGAN framework allows us to capture the complex relationships between input features, such as quark content, quantum numbers, and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and output properties, including mass and decay width. Our predictions, based on the CGAN framework, are consistent with existing data. By combining fundamental knowledge of QCD with advanced machine learning techniques, this work represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of fully-heavy tetraquark states. Our CGAN approach has the potential to become a strong contender for future studies in heavy tetraquark systems, complementing existing theoretical models to deliver more precise results. Additionally, our findings could assist in the search for fully-heavy tetraquark systems in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results imply that the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run can potentially be refined to be an order of magnitude stronger.</description>

Abstract: The response of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs), a type of thin silicon detector with internal gain, to X-rays of energies between 6-16~keV was characterized at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The utilized beamline at SSRL was 7-2, with a nominal beam size of 30~$\mu$m, repetition rate of 500~MHz, and with an energy dispersion $\Delta E/E$ of $10^{-4}$. Multi-channel LGADs, AC-LGADs, and TI-LGADs of different thicknesses and gain layer configurations from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) were tested. The sensors were read out with a discrete component board and digitized with a fast oscilloscope or a CAEN fast digitizer. The devices' energy response, energy resolution, and time resolution were measured as a function of X-ray energy and position. The charge collection and multiplication mechanism were simulated using TCAD Sentaurus, and the results were compared with the collected data.</description>

      <title>Test of LGAD as Potential Next-Generation {\mu}SR Spectrometer Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance ($\mu$SR) is a versatile and powerful non-destructive technology for investigating the magnetic properties of materials at the microscopic level. The $\mu$SR technique typically utilizes fully spin polarized beams of positive muons generated at particle accelerator facilities and measures the evolution of the muon spin polarization inside a sample to extract information about the local magnetic environment in materials. With the development of accelerator technologies, intensities of muon beams are being continuously improved, which will cause a pile-up problem to the $\mu$SR spectrometer. The first muon source in China, named MELODY, is currently under construction and will be a pulsed source of muons operated at a repetition frequency of only 1 Hz due to limitations of the accelerator system at CSNS. Consequently, there is a strong motivation to operate MELODY at significantly higher muon intensities. This necessitates an upgrade of the detector system inside the spectrometer, which should be smaller and faster to accommodate the increased intensity per pulse of muons. The Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD), characterized by a typical pulse width of 2 ns and a segmentation size in the centimeters range, has the potential to significantly improve the counting rates of $\mu$SR spectrometers that utilize a high intensity pulsed muon source. Thus, it is expected that the LGAD detector is a promising candidate to enhance the performance of $\mu$SR spectrometers at the new MELODY muon source.To validate this, tests on the LGAD were conducted at the ISIS pulsed muon source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. This paper will describe the setup of the candidate LGAD devices and the subsequent analysis of the experiment data.</description>

      <title>ILC250 Cost Update -- 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider was conceived as a global project for an energy-frontier electron-positron collider.It employs superconducting RF and nano-beam technologies with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. Its cost was estimated in 2013, based on the Technical Design Report published in 2013.Japan's high-energy community proposed to host the ILC in Japan as a Higgs boson factory at 250 GeV in its first phase, and a revised cost estimate was conducted in 2017 to host it in Japan. However, due to global price increases and currency fluctuations that emerged afterward, the 2017 estimate is now outdated. A new cost evaluation has therefore been performed, according for global inflation tends, exchange rate shifts, and recent experiences in SRF based accelerators. This report describes the cost update performed in 2024. The cost update is included in the ILC Status Report in May 2025, contributing to the ongoing 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>
