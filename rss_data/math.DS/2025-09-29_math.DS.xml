      <title>A note on the structural stability of almost one-to-one maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous surjection $\pi:X\to Y$ between compact Hausdorff spaces induces continuous surjections $\mathcal{M}(\pi)\colon \mathcal{M}(X)\to\mathcal{M}(Y)$ and $\mathcal{H}(\pi): \mathcal{H}(X)\to\mathcal{H}(Y)$ between the spaces of regular Borel probability measures, and the spaces of closed subsets, respetively. It is well known that $\mathcal{H}(\pi)$ is irreducible if and only if $\pi$ is irreducible. We show that $\mathcal{M}(\pi)$ is irreducible if and only if $\pi$ is irreducible. Furthermore, we show that whenever $\pi$ is almost one-to-one then $\mathcal{M}(\pi)$ and $\mathcal{H}(\pi)$ are almost one-to-one. In particular, we observe that continuous surjections between compact metric spaces are almost one-to-one if and only if $\mathcal{H}(\pi)$ is almost one-to-one and a similar statement about $\mathcal{M}(\pi)$. Finally, we give alternative proofs for some results in 'Characterizations of open and semi-open maps of compact Hausdorff spaces by induced maps' by Xiongping Dai and Yuxuan Xie regarding semi-open maps.</description>

      <title>Uniform \emph{a priori} bounds for neutral renormalization. Variation~\RN{2}: $\psi^\bullet$-ql Siegel maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend uniform pseudo-Siegel bounds for neutral quadratic polynomials to $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like Siegel maps. In this form, the bounds are compatible with the $\psi$-quadratic-like renormalization theory and are easily transferable to various families of rational maps. The main theorem states that the degeneration of a Siegel disk is equidistributed among combinatorial intervals. This provides a precise description of how the $\psi^\bullet$-quadratic-like structure degenerates around the Siegel disk on all geometric scales except on the ``transitional scales'' between two specific combinatorial levels.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to fuzzy iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we unify two extensions of the classical Hutchinson--Barnsley theory - the topological and the fuzzy-set approaches. We show that a fuzzy iterated function system (fuzzy IFS) on a Tychonoff space $X$ which is contracting w.r.t. some admissible multimetric, generates a natural fuzzy attractor in the hyperspace $\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ of all compact fuzzy sets. As a consequence, we prove that a fuzzy IFS on a Hausdorff topological space which is topologically contracting admits a fuzzy attractor in a bit weaker sense. Our discussion involves investigations on topologies on the hyperspace $\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{F}}(X)$ which are suitable for establishing convergence of sequences of iterations of a fuzzy Hutchinson operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of non-holonomic point-to-point controllability for ODEs with drift possessing some recursion property of the flow (nonwandering or chain recurrence) and satisfying various versions of H\"ormander condition (also known as Lie bracket generating condition). We show that for the flows on compact manifolds, it suffices to assume the validity of the H\"ormander condition on the closure of the set of their minimal points only. Also, we construct a 2-dimensional example of a drift defining a chain recurrent flow and the vector fields defining the non-holonomic constraint, which together satisfy the H\"ormander condition, but the flow is not controllable in the direction of the given vector fields.</description>

      <title>Parametrized complexity of relations between multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parametrized complexity of fundamental relations between multidimensional subshifts, such as equality, conjugacy, inclusion, and embedding, for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and effective subshifts. We build on previous work of E. Jeandel and P. Vanier on the complexity of these relations as two-input problems, by fixing one subshift as parameter and taking the other subshift as input. We study the impact of various dynamical properties related to periodicity, minimality, finite type, etc. on the computational properties of the parameter subshift, which reveals interesting differences and asymmetries.
  Among other notable results, we find choices of parameter that reach the maximum difficulty for each problem; we find nontrivial decidable problems for multidimensional SFT, where most properties are undecidable; and we find connections with recent work relating having computable language and being minimal for some property, showing in particular that this property may not always be chosen conjugacy-invariant.</description>

      <title>Geometric structure of stationary problem for spatial 1D self-diffusion equation with logistic growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the solution structure of non-trivial, non-constant stationary states of 1D spatial parabolic equations with nonlinear self-diffusion and logistic growth terms. A two-dimensional ordinary differential equation satisfying the stationary problem is derived and all its dynamics, including to infinity, is revealed by the Poincar\'e-Lyapunov compactification, one of the compactifications of phase space. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to classify all dynamical systems (especially connecting orbits) of a two-dimensional system including infinity. Therefore, the classification results for the dynamical system including to infinity give the classification results for the non-constant stationary states obtained only from the structure of the original equations. This argument allows us to observe a change in the classification of the non-constant stationary states by an explicit relation between the linear diffusion coefficient and the self-diffusion coefficient, combined with arguments about the symmetries and conserved quantities of the ODEs. This means that changing the self-diffusion coefficient as a bifurcation parameter not only qualitatively changes the dynamical system from a big saddle homoclinic orbit of the ODEs to a heteroclinic orbit that connects the saddle equilibria, but also significantly changes the shape and the properties of the stationary states. It explicitly shows the relationship between linear and self-diffusion, gives a characterization of non-trivial stationary states in terms of dynamical systems, and gives a deep insight into the influence of self-diffusion, one of the nonlinear diffusions.</description>

      <title>Dominated splittings and periodic data for quasi-compact operator cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For infinite-dimensional quasi-compact cocycles over a map satisfying a certain closing condition, we show that periodic orbits carry enough information to guarantee the existence of a dominated splitting. More precisely, we establish that if the moduli of the $(k+1)$-largest eigenvalues of the cocycle are $e^{\lambda_1n}\geq e^{\lambda_2n}\geq \ldots\geq e^{\lambda_kn}\geq e^{\lambda_{k+1}n}$ at every periodic point of period $n$, and $\lambda_k&gt;\lambda_{k+1}$, then the cocycle admits a dominated splitting of index $k$. As a consequence, if $\lambda_k&gt;0&gt;\lambda_{k+1}$ then the cocycle is uniformly hyperbolic. Furthermore, we are able to obtain these same conclusions even when the eigenvalues are only close to constant, not strictly constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new dynamic SIR model that, in contrast with the available model on time scales, is biological relevant. For the new SIR model we obtain an explicit solution, we prove the asymptotic stability of the extinction and disease-free equilibria, and deduce some necessary conditions for the monotonic behavior of the infected population. The new results are illustrated with several examples in the discrete, continuous, and quantum settings.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analyses for Continuous-time Linear Systems: System Identification and Online Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real world evolves in continuous time but computations are done from finite samples. Therefore, we study algorithms using finite observations in continuous-time linear dynamical systems. We first study the system identification problem, and propose a first non-asymptotic error analysis with finite observations. Our algorithm identifies system parameters without needing integrated observations over certain time intervals, making it more practical for real-world applications. Further we propose a lower bound result that shows our estimator is provably optimal up to constant factors. Moreover, we apply the above algorithm to online control regret analysis for continuous-time linear system. Our system identification method allows us to explore more efficiently, enabling the swift detection of ineffective policies. We achieve a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ over a single $T$-time horizon in a controllable system, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(T)$ observations of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a number field. Let $q(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ be a non-degenerate integral quadratic form in $n\geq 3$ variables with coefficients in $k$ and $m\in k^\times$. Let $X$ be the affine quadric defined by $q=m$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$. Based on results on effective equidistribution of $S$-integral points in symmetric spaces, we establish the following:
  (i) The arithmetic purity of strong approximation off any single place of $k$ for $X$;
  (ii) The geometric sieve for $p_0$-integral points on $X$ when $k=\mathbb{Q}$ and $p_0$ is a prime number.</description>

      <title>On the effectiveness of odor-baited traps on mosquito-borne infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The host's odor serves as a critical biological tracking signal in the host-seeking process of mosquitoes, and its heterogeneity significantly influences the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. In this study, we propose a mosquito-borne disease model incorporating odor-baited traps to examine the impact of odor on disease transmission. Following recent experimental evidence, we also assume that infected humans are more attractive than susceptible or recovered ones.
  The value of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, depends on the attractiveness of traps, adjusted relative to infected individuals; the dependence on the relative attractiveness of susceptibles is non-monotone, suggesting that there exists an optimal mosquito preference that maximizes disease transmission. When $R_0&gt;1$, there exists an endemic equilibrium which, under certain conditions, is proved to be globally stable. An endemic equilibrium may also exist when $R_0 &lt; 1$, due to a backward bifurcation occurring when infected humans incur significant mortality. The phenomenon of backward bifurcation is reduced when odor-baited traps are more abundant.
  Analytical results and simulations show that deploying traps and enhancing their lethality for mosquitoes can help reduce disease prevalence and the risk of an outbreak. However, the attenuation of odor in highly attractive traps may lead to a rebound in the epidemic, especially when the traps gradually lose their attractiveness compared to susceptible hosts.</description>

Abstract: For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>Twisted crossed products of Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a locally compact group $G$, a nondegenerate Banach algebra $A$ with a contractive approximate identity, a twisted action $(\alpha, \sigma)$ of $G$ on $A$, and a family $\mathcal{R}$ of uniformly bounded representations of $A$ on Banach spaces, we define the twisted crossed product $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$. When $\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\mathcal{R}(G,A,\alpha, \sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property.
  As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is "stably" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p \in (0,1)$, sample a binary sequence from the infinite product measure of Bernoulli$(p)$ distributions. It is known that for $p=1/2$, almost every binary sequence is Poisson generic in the sense of Peres and Weiss, a property that reflects a specific statistical pattern in the frequency of finite substrings. However, this behaviour is highly exceptional: it fails for any $p \ne 1/2$. In these other cases, we show that the frequency of substrings of almost every sequence has either trivial or peculiar behaviour. Nevertheless, the Poisson limiting regime can be recovered if one restricts attention to substrings with a fixed number of successes in the Bernoulli$(p)$ trials.</description>

      <title>Modeling the control of West Nile virus using mosquito reduction methods, vaccination of equids, and human behavioral adaptation to the usage of personal protective equipment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus Flaviviridae circulating between mosquitoes and birds, while humans, equids, and other mammals are dead-end hosts. Several preventive measures are recommended to reduce the WNV burden among different hosts. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework for evaluating the theoretical effectiveness of various WNV control methods in Germany. We consider mosquito reduction methods such as the physical removal and destruction of potential mosquito breeding sites, the use of larvicides, and the use of adulticides. We also evaluate the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that aims to reduce human-mosquito contact. Adopting PPEs may not happen instantly due to different perceptions, social influence, and the perceived inconvenience and/or frustration that come with using PPEs. Thus, we model a dynamic adoption of PPEs by considering the perceived risk of infection, perceived inconvenience of using PPEs, and the imitation dynamics due to social influence. Furthermore, the model captures vaccination of equids. We formulate and study an optimal control problem, where mosquito controls are temperature-dependent and the decision to start or stop applying the control methods is influenced by the changes in temperature. The optimal control model supports the development and seasonal timing of cost-effective mosquito control methods. For example, results from the optimal control study show that mosquito control efforts in Germany should be initiated during early spring and stopped at the end of June or early July, during the first year of control, to avoid overuse and unnecessary costs. Finally, we developed a Shiny app that allows users to test how different combinations of interventions could reduce WNV cases.</description>

Abstract: The transition from rotational to discontinuous behavior of the return map of the perturbed oscillators-step system, a paradigm model for a perturbation of a pseudo-integrable Hamiltonian impact system, is studied. The form of the return map is derived, and a truncated form of this map is simulated and analyzed. For a set of parameters the existence of a hovering set, a set of non-resonant orbits that pass sometimes above the step and sometimes to its side, without ever impacting it, is established and quantified. Its destruction as the sign of the perturbation term is reversed is established.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{KL}$ and Lyapunov Approaches for Discrete-time Peak Computation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to solve discrete-time peak computation problems (DPCPs for short). DPCPs are optimization problems that consist of maximizing a function over the reachable values set of a discrete-time dynamical system. The optimal value of a DPCP can be rewritten as the supremum of the sequence of optimal values. Previous results provide general techniques for computing the supremum of a real sequence from a well-chosen pair of a strictly increasing continuous function on [0,1] and a positive scalar in (0,1). In this paper, we exploit the specific structure of the optimal value of the DPCP to construct such a pair from classical tools from stability theory: $\mathcal{KL}$ certificate and Lyapunov functions.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave solutions for the generalized Burgers-Fisher equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traveling wave solutions, in the form $u(x,t)=f(x+ct)$, to the generalized Burgers-Fisher equation $$ \partial_tu=u_{xx}+k(u^n)_x+u^p-u^q, \quad (x,t)\in\mathbb{R}\times(0,\infty), $$ with $n\geq2$, $p&gt;q\geq1$ and $k&gt;0$, are classified with respect to their speed $c\in(-\infty,\infty)$ and the behavior at $\pm\infty$. The existence and uniqueness of traveling waves with any speed $c\in\mathbb{R}$ is established and their behavior as $x\to\pm\infty$ is described. In particular, it is shown that there exists a unique $c^*\in(0,\infty)$ such that there exists a unique soliton $f^*$ with speed $c^*$ and such that $$ \lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f^*(\xi)=\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f^*(\xi)=0, \quad \xi=x+ct. $$ Moreover, if $n&lt;p+q+1$ then $c^*&lt;kn$ and if $n&gt;p+q+1$ then $c^*&gt;kn$. For $c&lt;\min\{c^*,kn\}$, any traveling wave with speed $c$ satisfies $\lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f(\xi)=0$ and $\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f(\xi)=1$, while for $c&gt;\max\{c^*,kn\}$ any traveling wave with speed $c$ satisfies $\lim\limits_{\xi\to-\infty}f(\xi)=1$ and $\lim\limits_{\xi\to\infty}f(\xi)=0$. In particular, for any speed $c\in(0,c^*)$, there are traveling wave solutions $u$ with speed $c$ such that $u(x,t)\to1$ as $t\to\infty$, in contrast to the non-convective case $k=0$.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Input-Constrained Nonlinear Intercept Guidance in Multiple Engagement Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.</description>

      <title>When Simple is Enough, Binary Models Capture Social Complexity in Coupled Human-Environment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of coupled human-environment systems often face a tradeoff between realism and tractability. Spectrum opinion models, where social preferences vary continuously, offer descriptive richness but are computationally demanding and parameter-heavy. Binary formulations, in contrast, are analytically simpler but raise concerns about whether they can capture key socio-ecological feedbacks. Here we systematically compare binary and spectrum social models across four benchmark settings: (i) replicator dynamics coupled to a climate-carbon system, (ii) FJ opinion dynamics coupled to the climate-carbon system, (iii) replicator dynamics coupled to a forest-grassland ecological system, and (iv) FJ opinion dynamics coupled to a forest-grassland ecological system. We employ the relative integrated absolute error (RIAE) to quantify deviations between binary (N=2) and spectrum (N=100) formulations of social opinion dynamics in feedback with ecological subsystems. Across systematic parameter sweeps of learning rates, reluctance, conformity, susceptibility, runaway amplitudes, and ecological turnover, the binary formulation typically tracks its spectrum counterpart to within 15 percent for most parameter combinations. Deviations beyond this arise mainly under very high social susceptibility or near-vanishing ecological turnover, where additional opinion modes and nonlinear feedbacks matter. We therefore present the binary formulation as a practical surrogate, not a universal replacement. As a rule of thumb, it is adequate when susceptibility is moderate, ecological turnover appreciable, and runaway amplitudes not extreme; in high-susceptibility or low-turnover regimes, especially near critical transitions, the full-spectrum model is preferable. This framing guides readers on when a binary reduction is sufficient versus when full-spectrum detail is warranted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.17167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Furstenberg--Zimmer structure theory refers to the extension of the dichotomy between the compact and weakly mixing parts of a measure preserving dynamical system and the algebraic and geometric descriptions of such parts to a conditional setting, where such dichotomy is established relative to a factor and conditional analogues of those algebraic and geometric descriptions are sought. Although the unconditional dichotomy and the characterizations are known for arbitrary systems, the relative situation is understood under certain countability and separability hypotheses on the underlying groups and spaces. The aim of this article is to remove these restrictions in the relative situation and establish a Furstenberg--Zimmer structure theory in full generality. As an independent byproduct, we establish a connection between the relative analysis of systems in ergodic theory and the internal logic in certain Boolean topoi.</description>

Abstract: This is a complete study of the dynamics of polynomial planar vector fields whose linear part is a multiple of the identity and whose nonlinear part is a homogeneous polynomial. It extends previous work by other authors that was mainly concerned with the existence and number of limit cycles. The general results are also applied to two classes of examples where the nonlinearities have degrees 2 and 3, for which we provide a complete set of phase portraits.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies polynomials with core entropy zero. We give several characterizations of polynomials with core entropy zero. In particular, we show that a degree d post-critically finite polynomial f has core entropy zero if and only if f is in the degree d main molecule. The characterizations define several quantities which measure the complexities of polynomials with core entropy zero. We show that these measures are all comparable.</description>

      <title>Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While invariant measures are widely employed to analyze physical systems when a direct study of pointwise trajectories is intractable, e.g., due to chaos or noise, they cannot uniquely identify the underlying dynamics. Our first result shows that, in contrast to invariant measures in state coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), y(t), z(t)]$, the invariant measure expressed in time-delay coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), x(t-\tau),\ldots, x(t-(m-1)\tau)]$, can identify the dynamics up to a topological conjugacy. Our second result resolves the remaining ambiguity: by combining invariant measures constructed from multiple delay frames with distinct observables, the system is uniquely identifiable, provided that a suitable initial condition is satisfied. These guarantees require informative observables and appropriate delay parameters ($m,\tau$), which can be limiting in certain settings. We support our theoretical contributions through a series of physical examples demonstrating how invariant measures expressed in delay-coordinates can be used to perform robust system identification in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by three recent open questions in the study of linear dynamics, we study weighted shifts on sequence spaces. First, we provide an example of a weighted shift on a locally convex space whose topology is generated by a sequence of complete seminorms which is generalized hyperbolic, but does not have the shadowing property. Next, we characterise uniform topological expansivity on Fr\'echet spaces satisfying some very natural conditions. Finally, we study the periodic shadowing property on normed spaces leading to a condition formulated purely in terms of weights which we show is necessary for the periodic shadowing property on $\ell_p$ and equivalent on $c_0$.</description>

      <title>Network inference via process motifs for lagged correlation in linear stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\mathcal C}$ be a fixed equisingularity class of irreducible germs of complex analytic plane curves. We compute a basis of the ${\mathbb C}[[x]]$-module of K\"ahler differentials for generic $\Gamma \in {\mathcal C}$, algorithmically, and study its behaviour under blow-up.
  As a first application, we give an algorithm providing the generic semimodule in an equisingularity class in terms of its multiplicity and its Puiseux characteristic exponents. As another application, we give an alternative proof for a formula of Genzmer, that provides the dimension of the moduli of analytic classes in the equisingularity class of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Winning Opinion in the Voter Model: Following Your Friends' Advice or That of Their Friends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a variation of the classical voter model in which the set of influencing agents depends on an individual's current opinion. The initial population consists of a random sample of equally sized sub-populations for each state, and two types of interactions are considered: (i) direct neighbors, and (ii) second neighbors (friends of direct neighbors, excluding the direct neighbors themselves). The neighborhood size, reflecting regular network connectivity, is kept constant across all agents. Our findings reveal that varying the interaction range introduces asymmetries that influence the probability of consensus and convergence time. At low connectivity, direct neighbor interactions dominate, driving consensus. As connectivity increases, the probability of consensus for either state becomes equal, mirroring symmetric dynamics. It is shown that this asymmetric effect on the probability of consensus is independent of the network topology in small-world and scale-free networks. Asymmetry is also reflected in convergence time: while symmetric cases show decreasing times with increased connectivity, asymmetric cases exhibit an almost linear increase. Contrary to the probability of achieving consensus, the effect of asymmetry on the consensus time does depend on the network topology. The introduction of stubborn agents further accentuates these effects, particularly when they favor the less dominant state, significantly increasing consensus time. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for decision-making processes and political campaigns in human populations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the space of infinite volume ends of a locally compact second countable (lcsc) space that admits a Radon measure. In certain cases, this coincides with the classical space of ends.
  Consider a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of a unimodular lcsc group $G$ that is not coamenable. Assume that $G$ has property (T) and the associated homogeneous space $G/\Gamma$ is equipped with the Haar measure. We demonstrate that if $G$ is path connected, then $G/\Gamma$ has exactly one infinite volume end. In a related vein, if $G$ acts transitively on a locally finite connected graph $X$ with compact open vertex stabilizers and the action of the subgroup $\Gamma$ is free, we show that $X/\Gamma$ has exactly one end. We also obtain identical results for certain discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of nonamenable product groups $G$.
  These results can be applied to understand ends of Schreier graphs and infinite volume ends of quotients of symmetric spaces of noncompact type. For instance, for symmetric spaces $X$ of noncompact type without real or complex hyperbolic factors, every infinite-covolume quotient $\Gamma\backslash X$ has exactly one end of infinite Riemannian volume.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Nonlinear Data Assimilation Algorithm for Multi-Layer Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11042</link>

Abstract: State estimation in multi-layer turbulent flow fields with only a single layer of partial observation remains a challenging yet practically important task. Applications include inferring the state of the deep ocean by exploiting surface observations. Directly implementing an ensemble Kalman filter based on the full forecast model is usually expensive. One widely used method in practice projects the information of the observed layer to other layers via linear regression. However, when nonlinearity in the highly turbulent flow field becomes dominant, the regression solution will suffer from large uncertainty errors. In this paper, we develop a multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method. A sequence of nonlinear assimilation steps is applied from layer to layer recurrently. Fundamentally different from the traditional linear regression approaches, a conditional Gaussian nonlinear system is adopted as the approximate forecast model to characterize the nonlinear dependence between adjacent layers. The estimated posterior is a Gaussian mixture, which can be highly non-Gaussian. Therefore, the multi-step nonlinear data assimilation method can capture strongly turbulent features, especially intermittency and extreme events, and better quantify the inherent uncertainty. Another notable advantage of the multi-step data assimilation method is that the posterior distribution can be solved using closed-form formulae under the conditional Gaussian framework. Applications to the two-layer quasi-geostrophic system with Lagrangian data assimilation show that the multi-step method outperforms the one-step method with linear stochastic flow models, especially as the tracer number and ensemble size increase.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Learning and Extrapolating System Dynamics Across Bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from time-series data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We demonstrate our approach on three test cases: the Lorenz system transitioning from non-chaotic to chaotic behaviour, the R\"ossler system moving from chaos to period doubling, and a predator-prey model exhibiting collapse via a global bifurcation.</description>
