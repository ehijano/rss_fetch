      <title>Concordance structure set of connected sum of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the concordance structure set of connected sums of complex and quaternionic projective spaces in the real $n$-dimensional range with $8\leq n\leq 16$ is computed. It is demonstrated that the concordance inertia group of a connected sum equals the sum of individual concordance inertia groups. Furthermore, the concordance structure sets of manifolds and their connected sums are compared.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of linear symplectic quotients and $\operatorname{O}(2)$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit computations of the $\Gamma$-Euler characteristic of several families of orbit space definable translation groupoids. These include the translation groupoids associated to finite-dimensional linear representations of the circle and real and unitary representations of the real $2\times 2$ orthogonal group. In the case of translation groupoids associated to linear symplectic quotients of representations of a arbitrary compact Lie group $G$, we show that unlike the other cases, the $\Gamma$-Euler characteristic depends only on the group and not on the representation.</description>

      <title>On the Drinfeld formal group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify Drinfeld's formal group on the prismatization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a formal group arising from homotopy theory, given locally by the Quillen formal group of a decompleted variant of topological periodic cyclic homology. We also prove that this formal group extends to the syntomization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$, and that it admits a certain algebraization conjectured by Drinfeld.</description>

      <title>Equivariant automorphisms of the Cox construction and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we give a complete description of the group of holomorphic automorphisms of the Cox construction of a simplicial fan equivariant with respect to a large enough connected complex Lie subgroup of the large torus acting on the Cox construction. We then apply this description to find the groups of holomorphic automorphisms of rational moment-angle manifolds, including Calabi--Eckmann manifolds and Hopf manifolds. We also calculate the groups of equivariant automorphisms of complete simplicial toric varieties. This paper is the first in a series of two papers dedicated to studying the automorphism groups of toric stacks with applications to complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Tautological classes and higher signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a bundle of oriented closed smooth $n$-manifolds $\pi: E \to X$, the tautological class $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k} (E) \in H^{4k-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ is defined by fibre integration of the Hirzebruch class $\mathcal{L}_k (T_v E)$ of the vertical tangent bundle. More generally, given a discrete group $G$, a class $u \in H^p(B G;\mathbb{Q})$ and a map $f:E \to B G$, one has tautological classes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k ,u}(E,f) \in H^{4k+p-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ associated to the Novikov higher signatures.
  For odd $n$, it is well-known that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$ for all bundles with $n$-dimensional fibres. The aim of this note is to show that the question whether more generally $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ (for odd $n$) depends sensitively on the group $G$ and the class $u$.
  For example, given a nonzero cohomology class $u \in H^2 (B \pi_1 (\Sigma_g);\mathbb{Q})$ of a surface group, we show that always $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ if $g \geq 2$, whereas sometimes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)\neq 0$ if $g=1$.
  The vanishing theorem is obtained by a generalization of the index-theoretic proof that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$, while the nontriviality theorem follows with little effort from the work of Galatius and Randal-Williams on diffeomorphism groups of even-dimensional manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the bottleneck stability of rank decompositions of multi-parameter persistence modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant part of modern topological data analysis is concerned with the design and study of algebraic invariants of poset representations -- often referred to as multi-parameter persistence modules. One such invariant is the minimal rank decomposition, which encodes the ranks of all the structure morphisms of the persistence module by a single ordered pair of rectangle-decomposable modules, interpreted as a signed barcode. This signed barcode generalizes the concept of persistence barcode from one-parameter persistence to any number of parameters, raising the question of its bottleneck stability. We show in this paper that the minimal rank decomposition is not stable under the natural notion of signed bottleneck matching between signed barcodes. We remedy this by turning our focus to the rank exact decomposition, a related signed barcode induced by the minimal projective resolution of the module relative to the so-called rank exact structure, which we prove to be bottleneck stable under signed matchings. As part of our proof, we obtain two intermediate results of independent interest: we compute the global dimension of the rank exact structure on the category of finitely presentable multi-parameter persistence modules, and we prove a bottleneck stability result for hook-decomposable modules. We also give a bound for the size of the rank exact decomposition that is polynomial in the size of the usual minimal projective resolution, we prove a universality result for the dissimilarity function induced by the notion of signed matching, and we compute, in the two-parameter case, the global dimension of a different exact structure related to the upsets of the indexing poset. This set of results combines concepts from topological data analysis and from the representation theory of posets, and we believe is relevant to both areas.</description>

      <title>Directed degeneracy maps for precubical sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric transverse sets were introduced to make the construction of the parallel product with synchronization for process algebras functorial. It is proved that one can do directed homotopy on symmetric transverse sets in the following sense. A q-realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using a q-cofibrant replacement functor of flows. By topologizing the cotransverse maps, the cotransverse topological cube is constructed. It can be regarded both as a cotransverse topological space and as a cotransverse Lawvere metric space. A natural realization functor from symmetric transverse sets to flows is introduced using Raussen's notion of natural $d$-path extended to symmetric transverse sets thanks to their structure of Lawvere metric space. It is proved that these two realization functors are homotopy equivalent on cofibrant symmetric transverse sets by using the fact that the small category defining symmetric transverse sets is c-Reedy in Shulman's sense. This generalizes to symmetric transverse sets results previously obtained for precubical sets.</description>
