      <title>Linear reflected backward stochastic differential equations arising from vulnerable claims in markets with random horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the setting governed by $(\mathbb{F},\tau)$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the "public" flow of information, and $\tau$ is a random time which might not be $\mathbb{F}$-observable. This framework covers credit risk theory and life insurance. In this setting, we assume $\mathbb{F}$ being generated by a Brownian motion $W$ and consider a vulnerable claim $\xi$, whose payment's policy depends {\it{essentially}} on the occurrence of $\tau$. The hedging problems, in many directions, for this claim led to the question of studying the linear reflected-backward-stochastic differential equations (RBSDE hereafter), \begin{equation*} \begin{split} &amp;dY_t=f(t)d(t\wedge\tau)+Z_tdW_{t\wedge{\tau}}+dM_t-dK_t,\quad Y_{\tau}=\xi,\\ &amp; Y\geq S\quad\mbox{on}\quad \Lbrack0,\tau\Lbrack,\quad \displaystyle\int_0^{\tau}(Y_{s-}-S_{s-})dK_s=0\quad P\mbox{-a.s.}.\end{split} \end{equation*} This is the objective of this paper. For this RBSDE and without any further assumption on $\tau$ that might neglect any risk intrinsic to its stochasticity, we answer the following: a) What are the sufficient minimal conditions on the data $(f, \xi, S, \tau)$ that guarantee the existence of the solution to this RBSDE? b) How can we estimate the solution in norm using $(f, \xi, S)$? c) Is there an $\mathbb F$-RBSDE that is intimately related to the current one and how their solutions are related to each other? This latter question has practical and theoretical leitmotivs.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-type Inequalities for Markov Chains and Markov Processes: A Simple and Robust Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a new Bernstein-type deviation inequality for general discrete-time Markov chains via an elementary approach. More robust than existing works in the literature, our result only requires the Markov chain to satisfy an iterated Poincar\'e inequality. Moreover, our method can be readily generalized to continuous-time Markov processes naturally.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for Modified Massive Arratia Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modified massive Arratia flow is a model for the dynamics of passive particle clusters moving in a random fluid that accounts for the effects of mass aggregation. We show a central limit theorem for the point process associated to the cluster positions when the system is started from a uniform configuration. The critical mixing estimate is obtained by coupling the system to countably many independent Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>A degree-biased cutting process for random recursive trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a degree-biased cutting process on random recursive trees, where vertices are deleted with probability proportional to their degree. We verify the splitting property and explicitly obtain the distribution of the number of vertices deleted by each cut. This allows us to obtain a recursive formula for Kn, the number of cuts needed to destroy a random recursive tree of size n. Furthermore, we show that Kn is stochastically dominated by Jn, the number of jumps made by a certain random walk with a barrier. We obtain a convergence in distribution of Jn to a Cauchy random variable. We also explore the relationship of this cutting procedure to a coalescing process and show that the coalescing rate cannot correspond to a {\Lambda}-coalescent since it fails consistency conditions.</description>

      <title>Random Subwords and Pipe Dreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a probability $p\in(0,1)$. Let $s_i$ denote the transposition in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ that swaps $i$ and $i+1$. Given a word $\mathsf{w}$ over the alphabet $\{s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}\}$, we can generate a random subword by independently deleting each letter of $\mathsf{w}$ with probability $1-p$. For a large class of starting words $\mathsf{w}$ -- including all alternating reduced words for the decreasing permutation -- we compute precise asymptotics (as $n\to\infty$) for the expected number of inversions of the permutation represented by the random subword. This result can also be seen as an asymptotic formula for the expected number of inversions of a permutation represented by a certain random (non-reduced) pipe dream. In the special case when $\mathsf{w}$ is the word $(s_{n-1})(s_{n-2}s_{n-1})\cdots(s_1s_2\cdots s_{n-1})$, we find that the expected number of inversions of the permutation represented by the random subword is asymptotically equal to \[\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\,n^{3/2};\] this settles a conjecture of Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov.</description>

      <title>Network and interaction models for data with hierarchical granularity via fragmentation and coagulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nested family of Bayesian nonparametric models for network and interaction data with a hierarchical granularity structure that naturally arises through finer and coarser population labelings. In the case of network data, the structure is easily visualized by merging and shattering vertices, while respecting the edge structure. We further develop Bayesian inference procedures for the model family, and apply them to synthetic and real data. The family provides a connection of practical and theoretical interest between the Hollywood model of Crane and Dempsey, and the generalized-gamma graphex model of Caron and Fox. A key ingredient for the construction of the family is fragmentation and coagulation duality for integer partitions, and for this we develop novel duality relations that generalize those of Pitman and Dong, Goldschmidt and Martin. The duality is also crucially used in our inferential procedures.</description>

      <title>Identification of the parameters of complex constitutive models: Least squares minimization vs. Bayesian updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study the common least-squares minimization approach is compared to the Bayesian updating procedure. In the content of material parameter identification the posterior parameter density function is obtained from its prior and the likelihood function of the measurements. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \cite{Hastings1970}, the global density function including local peaks can be computed. Thus this procedure enables an accurate evaluation of the global parameter quality. However, the computational effort is remarkable larger compared to the minimization approach. Thus several methodologies for an efficient approximation of the likelihood function are discussed in the present study.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for fractional random walks on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem on a finite connected graph $G = (X, E)$, on whose vertices a conductivity $\gamma$ is defined. Our data consists in a sequence of partial observations of a fractional random walk on $G$. The observations are partial in the sense that they are limited to a fixed, observable subset $B \subseteq X$, while the random walk is fractional in the sense that it allows long jumps with a probability $P$ decreasing as a fractional power of the distance along the graph. The transition probability $P$ also depends on $\gamma$. We show that this kind of random walk data allows for the reconstruction of the amount of vertices $\|X\|$, the edge set $E$ and the conductivity $\gamma$ up to natural constraints, which we discuss. We also show a characterization of the random walk data in terms of the corresponding transition matrices $P$ , which highlights a new surprising nonlocal property. This work is motivated by the recent strong interest in the study of the fractional Calder\'on problem in the Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>On expected signatures and signature cumulants in semimartingale models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science, especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures (signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.</description>

      <title>An interpolation of discrete rough differential equations and its applications to analysis of error distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the solution $Y_t$ $(0\le t\le 1)$ and several approximate solutions $\hat{Y}^m_t$ of rough differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion with the Hurst parameter $1/3&lt;H&lt;1/2$. We have a decomposition $\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t=J_tI^m_t+R^m_t$, where $J_t$ is a Jacobian of $Y_t$, $I^m_t$ is a certain weighted sum process of Wiener chaos, and $R^m_t$ is the remainder term. By the weak convergence results and the H\"older estimates of $I^m_t$, we can see the weak convergence of the main term $(2^m)^{2H-1/2}J_tI^m_t$ as $m\to\infty$. The aim of this paper is to prove that the remainder term $R^m_t$ converges to $0$ very fast in the sense that $(2^m)^{2H-1/2+\varepsilon}\max_{0\le t\le 1}|R^m_t|\to 0$ in $L^p$ and almost surely for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$ as $m\to\infty$. To this end, we introduce an interpolation process $Y^{m,\rho}_t$ $(0\le \rho\le 1)$ between $\hat{Y}^m_t=Y^{m,1}_t$ and $Y_t=Y^{m,0}_t$, and give several estimates of the process of $Y^{m,\rho}_t$ and $\partial_{\rho}Y^{m,\rho}_t$.</description>

      <title>Obliquely reflecting Brownian motion in nonpolyhedral, piecewise smooth cones, with an example of application to diffusion approximation of bandwidth sharing queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work gives sufficient conditions for uniqueness in law of semimartingale, obliquely reflecting Brownian motion in a nonpolyhedral, piecewise ${\cal C}^2$ cone, with radially constant, Lipschitz continuous direction of reflection on each face.
  The conditions are shown to be verified by the conjectured diffusion approximation to the workload in a class of bandwidth sharing networks, thus ensuring that the conjectured limit is uniquely characterized. This is a key step in proving the diffusion approximation.
  This uniqueness result is made possible by replacing the Krein-Rutman theorem used by Kwon and Williams (1993) in a smooth cone with the recent reverse ergodic theorem for inhomogeneous, killed Markov chains of Costantini and Kurtz (2024).</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for Poisson $U$-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we obtain concentration inequalities for Poisson $U$-statistics $F_m(f,\eta)$ of order $m\ge 1$ with kernels $f$ under general assumptions on $f$ and the intensity measure $\gamma \Lambda$ of underlying Poisson point process $\eta$. The main result are new concentration bounds of the form \[ \mathbb{P}(|F_m ( f , \eta) -\mathbb{E} F_m ( f , \eta)| \ge t)\leq 2\exp(-I(\gamma,t)), \] where $I(\gamma,t)$ is of optimal order in $t$, namely it satisfies $I(\gamma,t)=\Theta(t^{1\over m}\log t)$ as $t\to\infty$ and $\gamma$ is fixed. The function $I(\gamma,t)$ is given explicitly in terms of parameters of the assumptions satisfied by $f$ and $\Lambda$. One of the key ingredients of the proof is bounding the centred moments of $F_m(f,\eta)$. We discuss the optimality of obtained concentration bounds and consider a number of applications related to Gilbert graphs and Poisson hyperplane processes in constant curvature spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for a class of stochastic partial differential equations by adding a suitable nonlinear noise, while the corresponding deterministic equations may only have local solutions. In particular, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system.
  Furthermore, our main results have broad applications, including not only all locally monotone stochastic equations in the variational framework (cf. \cite{LR2,LR1,RSZ1}), but also several new models such as stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations and stochastic surface growth models, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the current state of affairs in the study of thresholds and sharp thresholds in random structures on the occasion of the recent proof of the Kahn--Kalai Conjecture by Park and Pham and the fairly recent proof of the satisfiability conjecture for large $k$ by Ding, Sly, and Sun. Random discrete structures appear as fundamental objects of study in many scientific and mathematical fields including statistical physics, combinatorics, algorithms and complexity, social choice theory, coding theory, and statistics. While the models and properties of interest in these fields vary widely, much progress has been made through the development of general tools applicable to large families of models and properties all at once. Historically these tools originated to solve or make progress on specific, difficult conjectures in the areas mentioned above. We will survey recent progress on some of these hard problems and describe some challenges for the future.</description>

Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. While the upper bound of the simulation cost has been extensively studied through various quantum algorithms, much less work has focused on establishing the lower bound, particularly for the simulation of open quantum system dynamics. In this work, we present a general framework to calculate the lower bound for simulating a broad class of quantum Markov semigroups. Given a fixed accessible unitary set, we introduce the concept of convexified circuit depth to quantify the quantum simulation cost and analyze the necessary circuit depth to construct a quantum simulation scheme that achieves a specific order. Our framework can be applied to both unital and non-unital quantum dynamics, and the tightness of our lower bound technique is illustrated by showing that the upper and lower bounds coincide in several examples.</description>
