      <title>On Finite Fields and Higher Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic and biquadratic reciprocity have long since been referred to as "the forgotten reciprocity laws", largely since they provide special conditions that are widely considered to be unnecessary in the study of number theory. In this exposition of finite fields and higher reciprocity, we will begin by introducing concepts in abstract algebra and elementary number theory. This will motivate our approach toward understanding the structure and then existence of finite fields, especially with a focus on understanding the multiplicative group $\mathbb{F}^{*}$. While surveying finite fields we will provide another proof of quadratic reciprocity. We will proceed to investigate properties of the general multiplicative character, covering the concept of a general Gauss sum as well as basic notions of the Jacobi sum. From there we will begin laying the foundations for the cubic reciprocity law, beginning with a classification of the primes and units of the Eisenstein integers, denoted $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$, and further investigations into the residue class ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]/\pi\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ for $\pi$ prime, which is predominantly the world in which cubic reciprocity lies. We then define the general multiplicative character and state the full law of cubic reciprocity. We will finish the section on cubic reciprocity with a brief survey of the cubic residue character of the even prime $2$ and state a significant result due to Gauss that summarizes the conditions for $2$ to be a cubic residue. We conclude with a brief survey of the law of biquadratic reciprocity.</description>

      <title>The exotic inverted Kloosterman sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B$ be a product of finitely many finite fields containing $\mathbb F_q$, $\psi:\mathbb F_q\to \overline{\mathbb Q}_\ell^*$ a nontrivial additive character, and $\chi: B^*\to \overline{\mathbb Q}_\ell^*$ a multiplicative character. Katz introduced the so-called exotic inverted Kloosterman sum \begin{eqnarray*} \mathrm{EIK}(\mathbb F_q, a):=\sum_{\substack{x\in B^* \\ \mathrm{Tr}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)\not =0\\ \mathrm{N}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)=a}} \chi(x)\psi\Big(\frac{1}{\mathrm{Tr}_{B/\mathbb F_q}(x)}\Big), \ \ a\in \mathbb F_q^*. \end{eqnarray*} We estimate this sum using $\ell$-adic cohomology theory. Our main result is that, up to a trivial term, the associated exotic inverted Kloosterman sheaf is lisse of rank at most $2(n+1)$ and mixed of weight at most $n$, where $n+1 = \dim_{\mathbb F_q}B$. Up to a trivial main term, this gives the expected square root cancellation.</description>

      <title>A Number Field Analogue of Ramanujan's identity for $\zeta(2m+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan's famous formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$ has captivated the attention of numerous mathematicians over the years. Grosswald, in 1972, found a simple extension of Ramanujan's formula which in turn gives transformation formula for Eisenstein series over the full modular group. Recently, Banerjee, Gupta and Kumar found a number field analogue of Ramanujan's formula. In this paper, we present a new number field analogue of the Ramanujan-Grosswald formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$ by obtaining a formula for Dedekind zeta function at odd arguments. We also obtain a number field analogue of an identity of Chandrasekharan and Narasimhan, which played a crucial role in proving our main identity. As an application, we generalize transformation formula for Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(z)$ and Dedekind eta function $\eta(z)$. A new formula for the class number of a totally real number field is also obtained, which provides a connection with the Kronceker's limit formula for the Dedekind zeta function.</description>

      <title>Genus theory, governing field, ramification and Frobenius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop, through a governing field,  genus theory for a number field $\K$ with tame ramification in $T$ and splitting in $S$, where $T$ and $S$ are finite disjoint sets of primes of $\K$. This approach extends that initiated by the second author in the case of the class group. It allows expressing the $S$-$T$ genus number of a cyclic extension $\L/\K$ of degree $p$ in terms of the rank of a matrix constructed from the Frobenius elements of the primes ramified in $\L/\K$, in the Galois group of the underlying governing extension. For quadratic extensions $\L/\Q$, the matrices in question are constructed from the Legendre symbols between the primes ramified in  $\L/\Q$ and the primes in $S$.</description>

      <title>Some Diophantine equations involving arithmetic functions and Bhargava factorials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F. Luca proved for any fixed rational number $\alpha&gt;0$ that the Diophantine equations of the form $\alpha\,m!=f(n!)$, where $f$ is either the Euler function or the divisor sum function or the function counting the number of divisors, have only finitely many integer solutions $(m,n)$. In this paper we generalize the mentioned result and show that Diophantine equations of the form $\alpha\,m_1!\cdots m_r!=f(n!)$ have finitely many integer solutions, too. In addition, we do so by including the case $f$ is the sum of $k$\textsuperscript{th} powers of divisors function. Moreover, we observe that the same holds by replacing some of the factorials with certain examples of Bhargava factorials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from some of Norman Levinson's results, we construct interesting examples of functions $f(s)$ such that for $s=\frac12+it$, we have $Z(t)=2\Re\{\pi^{-\frac{s}{2}}\Gamma(s/2)f(s)\}$. For example one such function is \[\begin{aligned}{\mathcal R }_{-3}(s)=\frac12&amp;\int_{0\swarrow1}\frac{x^{-s}e^{3\pi ix^2}}{e^{\pi i x}-e^{-\pi i x}}\,dx\\&amp;+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}\int_{0\swarrow1}\frac{x^{-s}e^{\frac{\pi i}{3}x^2}}{e^{\pi i x}-e^{-\pi i x}}\Bigl(e^{\frac{\pi i}{2}}+2e^{-\frac{\pi i}{6}}\cos(\tfrac{2\pi x}{3})\Bigr)\,dx.\end{aligned}\]</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a set $A \subset \mathbf{N}$ such that one has $$ \sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n} = \exp\left(\left(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\right) (\log\log x)^{1/2} \log\log\log x \right)$$ and $$ \frac{1}{(\sum_{n \in A: n \leq x} \frac{1}{n})^2} \sum_{n,m \in A: n &lt; m \leq x} \frac{1}{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)} \asymp 1$$ for sufficiently large $x$. The exponent $\frac{1}{2}$ can replaced by any other positive constant, but the growth rate is otherwise optimal. This answers in the negative a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham.</description>

      <title>On patched completed homology and a conjecture of Venkatesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a CM field and $\Pi$ a regular algebraic cuspidal cohomological representation of $\mathbf{G}=\operatorname{PGL}_2/F$. A conjecture of Venkatesh describes the structure of the contribution of $\Pi$ to the homology of the locally symmetric spaces associated to $\mathbf{G}$. We investigate this conjecture in the setting of $p$-adic homology with $p$ a totally split prime. Along the way, we elaborate on the relations between Venkatesh's conjecture and completed homology, the Taylor-Wiles method and the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence. Our main result is a `big $R=T$' theorem in characteristic 0, from which we deduce a variant of the $p$-adic realisation of Venkatesh's conjecture, conditional on various natural conjectures and technical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Gaps in the complex Farey sequence of an imaginary quadratic number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0&lt;|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.</description>

      <title>On a problem of Nathanson on non-minimal additive complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ and $W$ be two sets of integers. If $C+W=\mathbb{Z}$, then $C$ is called an additive complement to $W$. We further call $C$ a minimal additive complement to $W$ if no proper subset of $C$ is an additive complement to $W$. Answering a problem of Nathanson in part, we give sufficient conditions of $W$ which has no minimal additive complements. Our result also extends the prior result of Chen and Yang.</description>

      <title>A Ramanujan bound for Drinfeld modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Lefschetz trace formula for B\"ockle-Pink crystals on tame Deligne-Mumford stacks of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and apply it to the crystal associated to the universal Drinfeld module. Combined with the Eichler-Shimura theory developed by B\"ockle, this leads to a trace formula for Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms. As a corollary, we deduce a Ramanujan bound on the traces of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>Traces of Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms for $\mathbb{F}_q[T]$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study traces of Hecke operators on Drinfeld modular forms of level 1 in the case $A = \mathbb{F}_q[T]$. We deduce closed-form expressions for traces of Hecke operators corresponding to primes of degree 1 and provide algorithms for primes of higher degree. We improve the Ramanujan bound and deduce the decomposition of cusp forms of level $\Gamma_0(T)$ into oldforms and newforms, as conjectured by Bandini-Valentino, under the hypothesis that each Hecke eigenvalue has multiplicity less than $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p&gt;3$ be a prime and $(\frac{.}{p})$ be the Legendre symbol. For any integer $d$ with $p\nmid d$ and any positive integer $m$, Sun introduced the determinants $$T_m(d,p)=\det\left[(i^2+dj^2)^m\left(\frac{i^2+dj^2}{p}\right)\right]_{1\leqslant i,j \leqslant (p-1)/2},$$ and $$D_p^{(m)}= \det\left[(i^2-j^2)^m\left(\frac{i^2-j^2}{p}\right)\right]_{1\leq i,j\leq (p-1)/2} .$$ In this paper, we obtain some properties of $T_m (d,p)$ and $ \sqrt{D_p^{(m)}}$ for some $m$. We also confirm some related conjectures posed by Zhi-Wei Sun.</description>

Abstract: Let $f$ be a real arithmetic function and let $g:[1,\infty[\to{\mathbb R}$ be a smooth function. We describe two emblematic instances in which saddle-point estimates may be used to evaluate the frequency, on the set of integers $n\leqslant x$, of the event $\{f(n)\leqslant g(n)\}$ from those relevant to the event $\{f(n)\leqslant y\}$. The first example revisits Dickman's historical contribution to the theory of friable integers. The second is concerned with the distribution of the squarefree kernel of an integer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study arithmetic properties of certain determinants involving powers of $i^2+cij+dj^2$, where $c$ and $d$ are integers. For example, for any odd integer $n&gt;1$ with $(\frac dn)=-1$ we prove that $\det [ (\frac{i^2+cij+dj^2}{n})]_{0\le i,j\le n-1}$ is divisible by $\varphi(n)^2$, where $(\frac{\cdot}{n})$ is the Jacobi symbol and $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. This confirms a previous conjecture of the second author.</description>

      <title>The Fibonacci-Fubini and Lucas-Fubini numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the combinatorial interpretation of the ordered Bell numbers, which count all the ordered partitions of the set $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we introduce the Fibonacci partition as a Fibonacci permutation of its blocks. Then we define the Fibonacci-Fubini numbers that count the total number of Fibonacci partitions of $[n]$. We study the classical properties of this sequence (generating function, explicit and Dobi\'nski-like formula, etc.), we give combinatorial interpretation, and we extensively examine the Fibonacci-Fubini arithmetic triangle. We give some associate linear recurrence sequences, where in some sequences the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds appear as well.</description>

      <title>On the number of sets with small sumset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate subsets with small sumset in arbitrary abelian groups. For an abelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \subseteq G$ we show that if $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$ is at most \[2^{o(s)}\binom{\frac{m+\beta}{2}}{s},\] where $\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most $\left(1+o(1)\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\mathbb{Z}$ and many other groups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining gap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.
  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$. Under the same assumption that $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an arithmetic progression $P \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$ containing all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for asymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\"otzel. The main tool behind our proofs is a graph container theorem combined with a variant of an asymmetric hypergraph container theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a fixed odd prime and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ splits. Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over $K$ with supersingular reduction at both primes above $p$ in $K$. Under certain assumptions, we give a growth estimate for the Mordell--Weil rank of $A$ over finite extensions inside the $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension of $K$. In the last section, written by Chris Williams, he includes some speculative remarks on the $p$-adic $L$-functions for $\mathrm{GSp}(4)$ corresponding to the multi-signed Selmer groups constructed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Parity of ranks of Jacobians of curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Selmer groups of Jacobians of curves that admit an action of a non-trivial group of automorphisms, and give applications to the study of the parity of Selmer ranks. Under the Shafarevich--Tate conjecture, we give an expression for the parity of the Mordell--Weil rank of an arbitrary Jacobian in terms of purely local invariants; the latter can be seen as an arithmetic analogue of local root numbers, which, under the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, similarly control parities of ranks of abelian varieties. As an application, we give a new proof of the parity conjecture for elliptic curves. The core of the paper is devoted to developing the arithmetic theory of Jacobians for Galois covers of curves, including decomposition of their L-functions, and the interplay between Brauer relations and Selmer groups.</description>

      <title>The $\mu$-invariant change for abelian varieties over finite $p$-extensions of global fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the work of Lai, Longhi, Suzuki, the first two authors and study the change of $\mu$-invariants, with respect to a finite Galois p-extension $K'/K$, of an ordinary abelian variety $A$ over a $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-extension of global fields $L/K$ that ramifies at a finite number of places at which $A$ has ordinary reductions. In characteristic $p&gt;0$, we obtain an explicit bound for the size $\delta_v$ of the local Galois cohomology of the Mordell-Weil group of $A$ with respect to a $p$-extension ramified at a supersingular place $v$. Next, in all characteristics, we describe the asymptotic growth of $\delta_v$ along a multiple $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension $L/K$ and provide a lower bound for the change of $\mu$-invariants of $A$ from the tower $L/K$ to the tower $LK'/K'$. Finally, we present numerical evidence supporting these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider finite graphs whose vertexes are supersingular elliptic curves, possibly with level structure, and edges are isogenies. They can be applied to the study of modular forms and to isogeny based cryptography. The main result of this paper is an upper bound on the modules of the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices, which in particular implies that these graphs are Ramanujan. We also study the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices, the number of connected components, the automorphisms of the graphs, and the connection between the graphs and modular forms.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees in $\mathbb{Z}$-covers of a finite graph and Mahler measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the special value at $u=1$ of Artin-Ihara $L$-functions, we associate to every $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a finite connected graph a polynomial which we call the \emph{Ihara polynomial}. We show that the number of spanning trees for the finite intermediate graphs of such a cover can be expressed in terms of the Pierce-Lehmer sequence associated to a factor of the Ihara polynomial. This allows us to express the asymptotic growth of the number of spanning trees in terms of the Mahler measure of this polynomial. Specializing to the situation where the base graph is a bouquet or the dumbbell graph gives us back previous results in the literature for circulant and $I$-graphs (including the generalized Petersen graphs). We also express the $p$-adic valuation of the number of spanning trees of the finite intermediate graphs in terms of the $p$-adic Mahler measure of the Ihara polynomial. When applied to a particular $\mathbb{Z}$-cover, our result gives us back Lengyel's calculation of the $p$-adic valuations of Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the irreducibility and Galois group of random polynomials over function fields. We prove that a random polynomial $f=y^n+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i(x)y^i\in\mathbb F_q[x][y]$ with i.i.d coefficients $a_i$ taking values in the set $\{a(x)\in\mathbb{F}_q[x]: \mathrm{deg}\, a\leq d\}$ with uniform probability, is irreducible with probability tending to $1-\frac{1}{q^d}$ as $n\to\infty$, where $d$ and $q$ are fixed. We also prove that with the same probability, the Galois group of this random polynomial contains the alternating group $A_n$. Moreover, we prove that if we assume a version of the polynomial Chowla conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, then the Galois group of this polynomial is actually equal to the symmetric group $S_n$ with probability tending to $1-\frac{1}{q^d}$. We also study the other possible Galois groups occurring with positive limit probability. Finally, we study the same problems with $n$ fixed and $d\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mod-2 arithmetic Milnor invariants, introduced by Morishita, provide a decomposition law for primes in canonical Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ with unitriangular Galois groups, and contain the Legendre and Redei symbols as special cases. Morishita further proposed a notion of mod-q arithmetic Milnor invariants, where q is a prime power, for number fields containing the q-th roots of unity and satisfying certain class field theory assumptions. We extend this theory from the number field context to general fields, by introducing a notion of a linking invariant for discrete valuations and orderings. We further express it as a Magnus homomorphism coefficient, and relate it to Massey product elements in Galois cohomology.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \ll 1, $$ where the implied constant is absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a conjecture of Arratia (2002) arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the left-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$. We also use this coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

Abstract: If a finite set $A$ tiles the integers by translations, it also admits a tiling whose period $M$ has the same prime factors as $|A|$. We prove that the minimal period of such a tiling is bounded by $\exp(c(\log D)^2/\log\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of $A$. In the converse direction, given $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2-\epsilon}$. We also discuss the relationship between minimal tiling period estimates and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We prove the classical $l = p$ local-global compatibility conjecture for certain regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of weight 0 for GL$_2$ over CM fields. Using an automorphy lifting theorem, we show that if the automorphic side comes from a twist of Steinberg at $v | l$, then the Galois side has nontrivial monodromy at $v$. Based on this observation, we will give a definition of the Fontaine-Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants attached to certain automorphic representations.</description>

Abstract: We determine the Brauer group of the Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$, the moduli space of elliptic curves with a marked $2$-torsion subgroup over bases of arithmetic interest. Antieau and Meier determine the Brauer group for $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$, the moduli stack of elliptic curves by exploiting the fact it is covered by the Legendre family and using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. Over an algebraically closed field, Shin uses the coarse space map to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{M}_{1,1}$. We combine techniques from both papers to determine the Brauer group of $\mathscr{Y}_0(2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of algorithmic randomness for algebraic fields. We prove the existence of a continuum of algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ that are random according to our definition. We show that there are noncomputable algebraic fields which are not random. We also partially characterize the index set, relative to an oracle, of the set of random algebraic fields computable relative to that oracle.
  In order to carry out this investigation of randomness for fields, we develop computability in the context of infinite Galois theory (where the relevant Galois groups are uncountable), including definitions of computable and computably enumerable Galois groups and computability of Haar measure on the Galois groups.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>
