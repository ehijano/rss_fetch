      <title>Investigation of Real-Space Transfer Noise in InP Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium phosphide (InP) high electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely used in many fields such as quantum computing because of their unparalleled microwave noise performance. Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.</description>

      <title>Field Reconstruction for High-Frequency Electromagnetic Exposure Assessment Based on Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fifth-generation (5G) communication systems, operating in higher frequency bands from 3 to 300 GHz, provide unprecedented bandwidth to enable ultra-high data rates and low-latency services. However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and experimental development of a high-conversion-efficiency rectifier at X-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage doubler rectifiers are usually applied to systems with high voltage and low current requirement. An X band voltage doubler rectifier has been developed with 72% conversion efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained rectifying efficiency is the maximum reported to date at X band with Schottky diodes. The working characteristics of the diodes in the voltage doubler rectifier are analyzed in detail. Closed-form equations of diode input impedance and rectifying efficiency are presented and validated using Advanced Design System simulations. The matching network design of the proposed rectifier is based on the closed-form equations. The preliminary rectifying efficiency is predicted by the closed-form equations as well. Measured and simulated results are in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Identifying Neutron Sources using Recoil and Time-of-Flight Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-source identification is central to nuclear physics and its applications, from planetary science to nuclear security, yet direct discrimination from neutron spectra remains fundamentally elusive. Here, we introduce a Bayesian protocol that directly infers source ensembles from measured neutron spectra by combining full-spectrum template matching with probabilistic evidence evaluation. Applying this protocol to recoil and time-of-flight spectroscopy, we recover single- and two-source configurations with strong statistical significance ($&gt;\!\!4\sigma$) at event counts as low as $\sim\!\!10^{3}$. These results demonstrate that neutron spectral signatures can be leveraged for robust source identification, opening a new observational window for both fundamental research and operationally driven applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband Spatio-Spectral Mode Conversion via Four-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for scalable and broadband free-space phase-matched four-wave mixing in ring resonators. This method for four-wave mixing reduces the complexity of coupling an emitter to a quantum network by combining the spatial and spectral interfaces between them into one nonlinear optical process. The device is compliant with current heterogeneous integration capabilities and has a bandwidth of 165 nm for efficient spatio-spectral conversion. We outline a fabrication-ready diamond-on-insulator pathway towards modular unit cells that natively bridge visible color centers to the infrared spectrum for scalable quantum networks. We also present and analyze an end-to-end framework for considering single-photon coupling efficiency from a color center to a quantum network. This framework represents a step forwards in analyzing and reducing system-scale losses in a spin-photon interface.</description>

      <title>Solid-state Laser Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the first proof-of-concept demonstrations of photoluminescence-based optical refrigeration, solid-state laser cooling has developed into a credible competitor to conventional cryogenic technologies. Solid-state laser cooling continues to advance as new materials push cooling limits. These developments have created a need to consolidate progress made to date as well as standardize critical experimental considerations needed for reliable and verifiable cooling measurements. This primer therefore outlines essential concepts and requirements, which underpin solid-state laser cooling. The primer summarizes key milestones achieved with cooling-grade, rare-earth-doped glasses and crystals as well as with semiconductors. It additionally highlights emerging applications of solid-state optical refrigeration. To strengthen the consistency and reproducibility of cooling results going forward, two reporting checklists are introduced. They cover materials, cooling metrics, and thermometry. This primer is intended to serve as both a tutorial and a practical reference for incoming and existing researchers involved in solid-state laser-cooling.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic generation of entangled travelling fields with different polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Controlled Altermagnetic Transition for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel magnetic phase with transformative potential for ultrafast spintronics, yet efficient control of their magnetic states remains challenging. We demonstrate an ultra-low-power electric-field control of altermagnetism in MnTe through strain-mediated coupling in MnTe/PMN-PT heterostructures with negligible Joule heating. Application of +6 kV/cm electric fields induces piezoelectric strain in PMN-PT, modulating the N\'eel temperature from 310 to 328 K. As a result, around the magnetic phase transition, the altermagnetic spin splitting of MnTe is reversibly switched "on" and "off" by the electric fields. Meanwhile, the piezoelectric strain generates lattice distortions and magnetic structure changes in MnTe, enabling up to 9.7% resistance modulation around the magnetic phase transition temperature. Leveraging this effect, we implement programmable resistance states in a Hopfield neuromorphic network, achieving 100% pattern recognition accuracy at &lt;=40% noise levels. This approach establishes the electric-field control as a low-power strategy for altermagnetic manipulation while demonstrating the viability of altermagnetic materials for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing beyond conventional charge-based architectures.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity threshold defines the optimal spin subset for ensemble quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite drive power leaves unavoidable spatial gradients in control fields, preventing spin ensembles from reaching the standard-quantum-limit sensitivity. We derive an analytic expression of ensemble sensitivity for inhomogeneous spin sensors and introduce sensitivity thresholds that reveal the optimal spin subset. Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles. We demonstrate phase-only digital holography to implement the optimal subsets and show that residual aberrations add less than 1 dB of sensitivity loss. Our framework imposes no fundamental trade-offs and extends quantum sensing to heterogeneous sensing environments.</description>

      <title>Fly-by transit: A novel door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.
  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Injection dynamics in spin-wave active ring oscillator (SWARO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated injection locking in spin-wave active ring oscillators (SWAROs) operating in the multi-mode regime. By applying external RF signals with varying frequency and power, we identified the locking behavior of individual modes and extracted the total locking ranges from spectral measurements. The results show asymmetric evolution of the lower and upper locking boundaries with drive power for the lower-frequency SWARO modes, while the highest-frequency mode exhibits nearly symmetric behavior. A maximum locking range of over 11 MHz is observed at a drive power of -10 dBm. To interpret these results, we develop an Adler-like model that captures the dependence of the locking range on drive power, showing good agreement for the higher-frequency modes. For the lowest-frequency mode, however, the model underestimates the locking range at low drive and saturates at high drive power levels, while the experimental range increases monotonically, indicating the influence of multi-mode interactions. These findings establish SWARO as a useful platform for exploring injection phenomena in spin-wave ring systems with delayed feedback and motivate the development of extended injection models that account for multi-mode dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient absolute interface energy calculations for heterostructures: Synergy between localized basis sets and surface passivation techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. Here, we present a computationally efficient framework for determining interface energies by incorporating a surface passivation technique, demonstrated using pseudo H passivation with a localized basis set method and an explicit chemical potential. This framework is applied to calculate absolute interface energies and analyze the electronic properties of quasi lattice matched and lattice mismatched III and V on Si interfaces, with results compared to conventional reconstructed surface calculations. By combining localized basis sets with surface passivation techniques, this framework allows for accurate estimation of absolute interface energies in heterogeneous material systems. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory, and moreover offers considerable potential for calculating interface energies across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of SiO$_2$/TiO$_2$ Heterostructures Grown by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second harmonic (SH) radiation can only be generated in non-centrosymmetric bulk crystals under the electric-dipole approximation. Nonlinear thin films made from bulk crystals are technologically challenging because of complex and high temperature fabrication processes. In this work, heterostructures made of amorphous materials SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$ were prepared by a CMOS-compatible technique named plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with deposition temperature at 100 {\deg}C. By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence properties, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications. By applying a fringe-based technique, we determined the largest diagonal component of the effective second-order bulk susceptibility $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ = 1.30$\pm$0.13 pm/V at a wavelength of 1032 nm. Noteworthy, we observed strong SH signals from two-component nanolaminates, which are several orders of magnitude larger than from single layers. The SH signals from our samples only require the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Here optical properties of nanocomposites can be precisely tuned by the promising PEALD technology.</description>
