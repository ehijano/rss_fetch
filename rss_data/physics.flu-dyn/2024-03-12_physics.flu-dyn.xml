      <title>A Spectral Element Enrichment Wall-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an enrichment wall-model within the spectral element method (SEM) framework for large-eddy simulations of wall-bounded flows. The method augments the polynomial solution in the wall-adjacent elements with an analytical law-of-the-wall enrichment function representing the mean velocity near the wall. In the solution representation, this enrichment function captures the large gradients in the boundary layer, which allows the polynomial modes to represent the turbulent fluctuations. The enriched solution is able to resolve the shear stress at the wall without any modification to the no-slip wall boundary conditions. The performance of the SEM enrichment wall-modeling approach is assessed in turbulent channel flow LES for a range of Reynolds numbers. The results show that the proposed method improves solution accuracy on under-resolved near-wall grids as compared to the traditional shear stress wall-models.</description>

      <title>Motion of a rigid sphere entering and penetrating a deep pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally examine the behavior of a free falling rigid sphere impacting normally onto, and penetrating into a quiescent liquid pool. Parameters, which are varied include the impact velocity, the density, and the diameter of the sphere. Observations of the sphere trajectory in time are made using two orthogonally placed high-speed cameras, yielding the velocity and acceleration vector through repeated differentiation of the time resolved trajectories.
  Upon penetration, the sphere goes through three very distinct phases of penetration, denoted as the submersion, deceleration and settling phase, each clearly identifiable through either features seen in trajectory direction or in changes of velocity. These phases exist for all impact Reynolds numbers and density ratios investigated, and their respective duration remain astoundingly constant in terms of dimensionless time. The motion of the sphere is analysed using a scalar force balance for each of instantaneous drag and lift, yielding quantitative estimates of the drag and lift coefficients throughout the trajectory. The variation of these forces can be phenomenologically explained by unsteady wake behavior arising from strong deceleration and through transient asymmetry, leading to variations in trajectory curvature. Despite the large trajectory randomness observed in repetitive experiments, there exist strong commonalities in motion behavior.</description>

      <title>CFD analysis of the influence of solvent viscosity ratio on the creeping flow of viscoelastic fluid over a channel-confined circular cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the role of solvent viscosity ratio ($\beta$) on the creeping flow characteristics of Oldroyd-B fluid over a channel-confined circular cylinder has been explored numerically. The hydrodynamic model equations have been solved by RheoTool, an open-source toolbox based on OpenFOAM, employing the finite volume method for extensive ranges of Deborah number ($De = 0.025-1.5$) and solvent viscosity ratio ($\beta = 0.1-0.9$) for the fixed wall blockage ($B = 0.5$). The present investigation has undergone extensive validation, with available literature under specific limited conditions, before obtaining detailed results for the relevant flow phenomena such as streamline, pressure and stress contour profiles, pressure coefficient ($C_p$), wall shear stress ($\tau_w$), normal stress ($\tau_{xx}$), first normal stress difference ($N_{1}$), and drag coefficient ($C_{\text{D}}$).The flow profiles have exhibited a distinctive behavior characterized by a loss of symmetry in the presence of pronounced viscoelastic and polymeric effects. The results for low $De$ notably align closely with those for Newtonian fluids, and the drag coefficient ($C_D$) remains relatively constant regardless of $\beta$, as the viscoelastic influence is somewhat subdued. As $De$ increases, the influence of viscoelasticity becomes more pronounced, while a decrease in $\beta$ leads to an escalation in polymeric effects; an increase in the $C_D$ value is observed as $\beta$ increases. Within this parameter range, the prevailing force governing the flow is the pressure drag force.</description>

      <title>CoNFiLD: Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion Model Generating Spatiotemporal Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Conditional Neural Field Latent Diffusion (CoNFiLD) model, a novel generative learning framework designed for rapid simulation of intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in chaotic and turbulent systems within three-dimensional irregular domains. Traditional eddy-resolved numerical simulations, despite offering detailed flow predictions, encounter significant limitations due to their extensive computational demands, restricting their applications in broader engineering contexts. In contrast, deep learning-based surrogate models promise efficient, data-driven solutions. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by a reliance on deterministic frameworks, which fall short in accurately capturing the chaotic and stochastic nature of turbulence. The CoNFiLD model addresses these challenges by synergistically integrating conditional neural field encoding with latent diffusion processes, enabling the memory-efficient and robust probabilistic generation of spatiotemporal turbulence under varied conditions. Leveraging Bayesian conditional sampling, the model can seamlessly adapt to a diverse range of turbulence generation scenarios without the necessity for retraining, covering applications from zero-shot full-field flow reconstruction using sparse sensor measurements to super-resolution generation and spatiotemporal flow data restoration. Comprehensive numerical experiments across a variety of inhomogeneous, anisotropic turbulent flows with irregular geometries have been conducted to evaluate the model's versatility and efficacy, showcasing its transformative potential in the domain of turbulence generation and the broader modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent droplet detachment behaviour from wettability-engineered fibers during fog harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water collection from natural and industrial fogs has recently been viewed as a viable freshwater source. An interesting outgrowth of the relevant research as focused on arresting of the drift losses (un-evaporated and re-condensed water droplets present in the exhaust plume from industrial cooling towers. Such exploits in fog collection have implemented metal and polyester meshes as fog water collectors (FWC). Fog droplets impinge and deposit on mesh fibers. They coalesce with previously deposited liquid to evolve as larger drops before detaching from the fibers under their own weight, an event largely dependent on the mesh fiber wettability, diameter and its arrangement relative to the fog flow. To better estimate drainage and hence collection from these fibers, the study, focuses on droplet detachment from differently wetted horizontally positioned cylindrical fibers of various diameters, placed orthogonally in the path of an oncoming fog. Droplet detachment volume is found to increase with fiber diameter and fiber surface wettability. Interestingly, in a typical fogging condition, the detachment volume is also found to exhibit a time-dependent behaviour, altering the droplet detachment criteria otherwise predicted from emulation. Our current study sheds light on this unexplored phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Instability of stratified air-water flows in circular pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with stability of two-phase stratified air-water flows in horizontal circular pipes. For this purpose, we performed a linear stability analysis, which considers all possible three-dimensional infinitesimal disturbances and takes into account deformations of the air-water interface. The main results are presented in form of stability maps, which compare well with the available experimental data. The neutral stability curves are accompanied by the corresponding wavenumbers and wave speeds of the critical perturbations, as well as by spatial patterns of their velocity components. Accordingly, several modes of the critical perturbation are revealed. Long waves are found to be the critical perturbation over part of the stability boundary, and they are affected by the surface tension due to the confinement effect of the lateral direction. Exploring the effect of pipe diameter on the stability boundary and critical perturbations shows that for small water holdups (i.e., thin water film) the scaling of the critical gas velocity by the gas Froude number is valid for pipe diameters larger than about 0.1m, where the surface tension effects due to the lateral confinement become negligible. Comparing results obtained in pipe, square duct, and two-plate geometries, we show that there are cases where the simplified geometry of two parallel plates can be employed to model the realistic geometry reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Fish-inspired tracking of underwater turbulent plumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous ocean-exploring vehicles have begun to take advantage of onboard sensor measurements of water properties such as salinity and temperature to locate oceanic features in real time. Such targeted sampling strategies enable more rapid study of ocean environments by actively steering towards areas of high scientific value. Inspired by the ability of aquatic animals to navigate via flow sensing, this work investigates hydrodynamic cues for accomplishing targeted sampling using a palm-sized robotic swimmer. As proof-of-concept analogy for tracking hydrothermal vent plumes in the ocean, the robot is tasked with locating the center of turbulent jet flows in a 13,000-liter water tank using data from onboard pressure sensors. To learn a navigation strategy, we first implemented Reinforcement Learning (RL) on a simulated version of the robot navigating in proximity to turbulent jets. After training, the RL algorithm discovered an effective strategy for locating the jets by following transverse velocity gradients sensed by pressure sensors located on opposite sides of the robot. When implemented on the physical robot, this gradient following strategy enabled the robot to successfully locate the turbulent plumes at more than twice the rate of random searching. Additionally, we found that navigation performance improved as the distance between the pressure sensors increased, which can inform the design of distributed flow sensors in ocean robots. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and limits of flow-based navigation for autonomously locating hydrodynamic features of interest.</description>

      <title>The effect of turbulence on the minimum thickness of a liquid film flowing down a vertical tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a liquid flows down a vertical tube at a low flowrate, it may not be able to completely cover the surface as a film, and the flow will comprise a number of rivulets separated by unwetted areas. Predictions of the minimum film thickness and corresponding minimum flowrate below which films cannot be sustained are needed in many industrial heat and mass transfer operations. In this paper a model is developed using the minimum energy method to calculate the minimum film thicknesses that can be maintained for flows down a vertical tube. It is concluded that inclusion of the effect of turbulence in the model can significantly increase the values of the calculated minimum film thicknesses. In these calculations (for 100 deg C water flowing down a 6 mm inside diameter tube) the effect of turbulence increased as the tube to liquid contact angle increased. For a flow at the highest contact angle of 90 degrees, the minimum film thickness increased by 22 % above the laminar value and the corresponding minimum flowrate increased by 75 %. The results of the calculations are compared to experimental data obtained from a falling film evaporator.</description>

      <title>Transient growth in diabatic boundary layers with fluids at supercritical pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the thermodynamic region close to the vapour-liquid critical point and in the proximity of the pseudo-boiling (Widom) line, strong property variations extensively alter the growth of modal instabilities, as revealed in Ren et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 871, 2019, pp. 831-864). Here, we study non-modal disturbances in the spatial framework using an eigenvector decomposition of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations for locally parallel flow. To account for non-ideality, a new energy norm is derived. At a constant free-stream Mach number of $10^{-3}$ along an isobar, three different regimes are considered by regulating the diabatic wall temperature: subcritical (liquid-like), supercritical (gas-like), and transcritical (across the Widom line). In the non-transcritical regimes, the resulting streamwise-independent streaks originate from the lift-up effect. Wall cooling is found to enhance the energy amplification for both subcritical and supercritical regimes. However, when the temperature profile is increased beyond the Widom line, a strong sub-optimal growth is observed over very short streamwise distances due to the Orr mechanism. The optimal energy growth at large distances is found to arise from an interplay between lift-up and Orr mechanism due to the additional presence of the transcritical Mode II. As a result, optimal disturbances are streamwise-modulated streaks with strong thermal components and with a propagation angle inversely proportional to the local Reynolds number. An $N$-factor comparison with modal growth reveals that transient growth is scarcely affected by a wall-temperature variation in the non-transcritical regimes. In contrast, in the transcritical regime, transient growth is greatly enhanced, especially when cooling beyond the Widom line. Here, non-modal $N$-factors are found to resemble the imposition of an adverse pressure gradient in the ideal-gas regime.</description>

      <title>Control of flow behavior in complex fluids using automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design of complex flows is notoriously challenging because of the high cost of high dimensional optimization. Usually, optimization problems are either restricted to few control parameters, or adjoint-based approaches are used to convert the optimization problem into a boundary value problem. Here, we show that the recent advances in automatic differentiation (AD) provide a generic platform for solving inverse problems in complex fluids. To demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we solve an array of optimization problems related to active matter motion in Newtonian fluids, dispersion in structured porous media, and mixing in journal bearing. Each of these problems highlights the advantages of AD in ease of implementation and computational efficiency to solve high-dimensional optimization problems involving particle-laden flows.</description>

      <title>Effect of non-equilibrium thermochemistry on Pitot pressure measurements in shock tunnels (or: Is 0.92 really the magic number?)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pitot pressure is the most common measurement in high total enthalpy shock tunnels for test condition verification. Nozzle calculations using multi-temperature non-equilibrium thermochemistry are needed in conjunction with Pitot measurements to quantify freestream properties. Pitot pressure is typically matched by tuning the boundary layer transition location in these simulations. However, non-equilibrium thermochemistry effects on the Pitot probe are commonly ignored. A computational study was undertaken to estimate the effect of nonequilibrium thermochemistry on Pitot pressure and freestream conditions. The test flow was produced by a Mach 7 nozzle in a reflected shock tunnel for air at a relatively low total enthalpy of 2.67 MJ/kg. Three different thermochemical models (equilibrium, finite-rate chemistry and two-temperature thermochemistry) were employed to compute flow variables at the nozzle exit and Pitot probe. Pitot pressures from these simulations were compared against those obtained via experiments. The results show a departure from the commonly utilized C of 0.92 in the reduced Rayleigh-Pitot equation form for high Mach numbers. Additionally, calculations were done with a sweep of free-stream conditions and resulting in C approximately 0.94. These results show that the influence of finite-rate thermochemistry should be taken into account, even at relatively low flow enthalpies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Estimation of the Convective Cooling Rate of Photovoltaic Arrays with Various Geometric Configurations: a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convective heat transfer is crucial for photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the power generation of PV is sensitive to temperature. The configuration of PV arrays have a significant impact on convective heat transfer by influencing turbulent characteristics. Conventional methods of quantifying the configuration effects are either through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations or empirical methods, which face the challenge of either high computational demand or low accuracy, especially when complex array configurations are considered. This work introduces a novel methodology to quantify the impact of geometric configurations of PV arrays on their convective heat transfer rate in wind field. The methodology combines Physics Informed Machine Learning (PIML) and Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) to construct a robust PIML-DCNN model to predict convective heat transfer rates. In addition, an innovative loss function, termed Pocket Loss is proposed to enhance the interpretability of the PIML-DCNN model. The model exhibits promising performance, with a relative error of 1.9\% and overall $R^2$ of 0.99 over all CFD cases in estimating the coefficient of convective heat transfer, when compared with full CFD simulations. Therefore, the proposed model has the potential to efficiently guide the configuration design of PV arrays for power generation enhancement in real-world operations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modelling of rarefied gas mixtures with disparate mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of rarefied gas flow based on the Boltzmann equation is challenging, especially when the gas mixtures have disparate molecular masses. In this paper, a computationally tractable kinetic model is proposed for monatomic gas mixtures, to mimic the Boltzmann collision operator as closely as possible. The intra- and inter-collisions are modelled separately using relaxation approximations, to correctly recover the relaxation timescales that could span several orders of magnitude. The proposed kinetic model preserves the accuracy of the Boltzmann equation in the continuum regime by recovering the four critical transport properties of a gas mixture: the shear viscosity, the thermal conductivity, the coefficients of diffusion and the thermal diffusion. While in the rarefied flow regimes, the kinetic model is found to be accurate when comparing its solutions with those from the direct simulation Monte Carlo method in several representative cases (e.g. one-dimensional normal shock wave, Fourier flow and Couette flow, two-dimensional supersonic flow passing a cylinder and nozzle flow into a vacuum), for binary mixtures with a wide range of mass ratios (up to 1000), species concentrations, and different intermolecular potentials. Pronounced separations in species properties have been observed, and the flow characteristics of gas mixtures in shock waves are found to change as the mass difference increases from moderate to substantial.</description>

      <title>Breakup of oil slicks on wavy water surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We hypothesize that the spread of oil slicks on the water's surface during oil spills is significantly influenced by water wave motion at the initial or intermediate spreading stages, well before emulsification processes have a substantial impact on the oil film's state. We demonstrate that the spreading dynamics of an oil slick on the water surface are facilitated by water waves, employing the thin film approximation. It is shown that water wave motion can rapidly deplete any oil slick, reducing the oil layer's thickness to nearly zero. This mechanism may act as a precursor to emulsification processes, leading to the accelerated depletion of oil spills into a distribution of droplets that form an emulsion.</description>

      <title>Elasticity affects the shock-induced aerobreakup of a polymeric droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boger fluids are viscoelastic liquids having constant viscosity for a broad range of shear rates. They are commonly used to separate the effects of liquid elasticity from viscosity in any experiment. We present an experimental study on the shock-induced aerobreakup of a Boger fluid droplet in the Shear-induced entrainment (SIE) and catastrophic breakup regime (Weber number ranging from ~ 800 to 5000). The results are compared with the aerobreakup of a Newtonian droplet having similar viscosity, and with shear-thinning droplets. The study aims to identify the role of liquid elasticity without the added complexity of simultaneous shear-thinning behavior. It is observed that at the early stages of droplet breakup, liquid elasticity plays an insignificant role, and all the fluids show similar behavior. However, during the late stages, the impact of liquid elasticity becomes dominant, which results in a markedly different morphology of the fragmenting liquid mass compared to a Newtonian droplet.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spatial evolution of degenerate quartets of water waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we investigate the Benjamin-Feir (or modulation) instability for the spatial evolution of water waves from the perspective of the discrete, spatial Zakharov equation, which captures cubically nonlinear and resonant wave interactions in deep water without restrictions on spectral bandwidth. Spatial evolution, with measurements at discrete locations, is pertinent for laboratory hydrodynamic experiments, such as in wave flumes, which rely on time-series measurements at a series of fixed gauges installed along the facility. This setting is likewise appropriate for experiments in electromagnetic and plasma waves. Through a reformulation of the problem for a degenerate quartet, we bring to bear techniques of phase-plane analysis which elucidate the full dynamics without recourse to linear stability analysis. In particular we find hitherto unexplored breather solutions and discuss the optimal transfer of energy from carrier to sidebands. Finally, we discuss the observability of such discrete solutions in light of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A time-dependent formulation for nonlinear gravity-capillary surface waves with viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a time-dependent conformal method to study the effect of viscosity on steep surface waves. When the effect of surface tension is included, numerical solutions are found that contain highly oscillatory parasitic capillary ripples. These small amplitude ripples are associated with the high curvature at the crest of the underlying viscous-gravity wave, and display asymmetry about the wave crest. Previous inviscid studies of steep surface waves have calculated intricate bifurcation structures that appear for small surface tension. We show numerically that viscosity suppresses these. While the discrete solution branches still appear, they collapse to form a single smooth branch in limit of small surface tension. Temporal stability is also studied, and these solutions are seen to be stable when time-evolved from different initial conditions. Our work provides a convenient method for the numerical computation and analysis of water waves with viscosity, without evaluating the free-boundary problem for the full Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>A preconditioning for the spectral solution of incompressible variable-density flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, the efficiency of preconditioners for solving linear systems associated with the discretized variable-density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with semiimplicit second-order accuracy in time and spectral accuracy in space is investigated. The method, in which the inverse operator for the constant-density flow system acts as preconditioner, is implemented for three iterative solvers: the General Minimal Residual, the Conjugate Gradient and the Richardson Minimal Residual. We discuss the method, first, in the context of the one-dimensional flow case where a top-hat like profile for the density is used. Numerical evidence shows that the convergence is significantly improved due to the notable decrease in the condition number of the operators. Most importantly, we then validate the robustness and convergence properties of the method on two more realistic problems: the two-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem and the three-dimensional variable-density swirling jet.</description>

      <title>Nested traveling wave structures in elastoinertial turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic flow resulting from the interplay between inertia and viscoelasticity in wall bounded shear flows. Understanding EIT is important because it is thought to set a limit on the effectiveness of turbulent drag reduction in polymer solutions. In the present study, we analyze simulations of two dimensional EIT in channel flow using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), discovering a family of traveling wave structures that capture the sheetlike stress fluctuations that characterize EIT. The frequency dependence of the leading SPOD mode contains several distinct peaks and the mode structures corresponding to these peaks exhibit well defined traveling structures. The structure of the dominant traveling mode exhibits shift reflect symmetry similar to the viscoelasticity modified Tollmien Schlichting (TS) wave, where the velocity fluctuation in the traveling mode is characterized by the formation of large scale regular structures spanning the channel and the polymeric stress field is characterized by the formation of thin, inclined sheets of high polymeric stress localized at the critical layers near the channel walls. The structures corresponding to the higher frequency modes have a very similar structure, but nested in a region roughly bounded by the critical layer positions of the next lower frequency mode. A simple theory based on the idea that the critical layers of mode $k$ form the walls for the structure of mode $k+1$ yields quantitative agreement with the observed wave speeds and critical layer positions. The physical idea behind this theory is that the sheetlike localized stress fluctuations in the critical layer prevent velocity fluctuations from penetrating them.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced transitions past the onset of a steady symmetry-breaking bifurcation: the case of the sudden expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows, governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, subject to a steady symmetry-breaking bifurcation and forced by a weak noise acting on a slow time scale. By generalizing the multiple-scale weakly nonlinear expansion technique employed in the literature for the response of the Duffing oscillator, we rigorously derive a stochastically forced Stuart-Landau equation for the dominant symmetry-breaking mode. The probability density function of the solution, and of the escape time from one attractor to the other, are then determined by solving the associated Fokker-Planck equation. The validity of this reduced order model is tested on the flow past a sudden expansion, for a given Reynolds number and different noise amplitudes. At a very low numerical cost, the statistics obtained from the amplitude equation accurately reproduce those of long-time direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the stability of fully nonlinear hydraulic-fall solutions to the forced water-wave problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional free-surface flow over localised topography is examined with the emphasis on the stability of hydraulic-fall solutions. A Gaussian topography profile is assumed with a positive or negative amplitude modelling a bump or a dip, respectively. Steady hydraulic-fall solutions to the full incompressible, irrotational Euler equations are computed, and their linear and nonlinear stability is analysed by computing eigenspectra of the pertinent linearised operator and by solving an initial value problem. The computations are carried out numerically using a specially developed computational framework based on the finite element method. The Hamiltonian structure of the problem is demonstrated and stability is determined by computing eigenspectra of the pertinent linearised operator. It is found that a hydraulic-fall flow over a bump is spectrally stable. The corresponding flow over a dip is found to be linearly unstable. In the latter case, time-dependent simulations show that the flow ultimately settles into a time-periodic motion that corresponds to an invariant solution in an appropriately defined phase space. Physically, the solution consists of a localised large amplitude wave that pulsates above the dip while simultaneously emitting nonlinear cnoidal waves in the upstream direction and multi-harmonic linear waves in the downstream direction.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics simulation of the abrupt changes in the thermodynamic properties of water after formation of nano-bubbles / nano-cavities induced by passage of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale formalism that accounts for the formation of nano-scale bubbles/cavities owing to a burst of water molecules after the passage of high energy charged particles that leads to the formation of hot non-ionizing excitations or thermal spikes (TS). We demonstrate the coexistence of a rapidly growing condensed state of water and a hot spot that forms a stable state of diluted water at high temperatures and pressures, possibly at a supercritical phase. Depending on the temperature of TS, the thin shell of a highly dense state of water grows by three to five times the speed of sound in water, forming a thin layer of shock wave (SW) buffer, wrapping around the nano-scale cylindrical symmetric cavity. The stability of the cavity, as a result of the incompressibility of water at ambient conditions and the surface tension, allows the transition of supersonic SW to a subsonic contact discontinuity and dissipation to thermo-acoustic sound waves. We further study the mergers of nanobubbles that lead to fountain-like or jet-flow structures at the collision interface. We introduce a time delay in the nucleation of nano-bubbles, a novel mechanism, responsible for the growth and stability of much larger or even micro-bubbles, possibly relevant to FLASH ultra-high dose rate (UHDR). The current study is potentially significant at FLASH-UHDRs. Our analysis predicts the black-body radiation from the transient supercritical state of water localized in nano-cavities wrapping around the track of charged particles can be manifested in the (indirect) water luminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>A Functionally Connected Element Method for Solving Boundary Value Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the general forms of piece-wise functions on partitioned domains satisfying an intrinsic $C^0$ or $C^1$ continuity across the sub-domain boundaries. These general forms are constructed based on a strategy stemming from the theory of functional connections, and we refer to partitioned domains endowed with these general forms as functionally connected elements (FCE). We further present a method, incorporating functionally connected elements and a least squares collocation approach, for solving boundary and initial value problems. This method exhibits a spectral-like accuracy, with the free functions involved in the FCE form represented by polynomial bases or by non-polynomial bases of quasi-random sinusoidal functions. The FCE method offers a unique advantage over traditional element-based methods for boundary value problems involving relative boundary conditions. A number of linear and nonlinear numerical examples in one and two dimensions are presented to demonstrate the performance of the FCE method developed herein.</description>

      <title>Topological transport of a classical droplet in a lattice of time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thouless charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices whose operation relies on topology. They provide the means for transporting quantum matter in space lattices with a single quantum precision. Contrasting space crystals that spontaneously break a continuous spatial translation symmetry and form crystals in space,time crystals have emerged as novel states of matter that organize into time lattices and spontaneously break a discrete time translation symmetry. The utility of Thouless pumps that enable topologically protected quantised transport of electrons and neutral atoms in spatial superlattices leads to the question if corresponding devices exist for time crystals? Here we show that topological pumps can be realized for time solids by transporting droplets of a liquid forward and backward in time lattices and we measure the topological index that characterises such pumping processes. By exploiting a synthetic time dimension classical time crystals can circumvent the quantum tunneling that underpins Thouless charge pumps. Our results establish topological pumping through time instead of space and pave the way for applications of time crystals.</description>

      <title>Jeffery Orbits with Noise Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of non-spherical particles in a shear-flow is of significant practical and theoretical interest. These systems have been the object of numerous investigations since the pioneering work of Jeffery a century ago. His eponymous orbits describe the deterministic motion of an isolated, rod-like particle in a shear flow. Subsequently, the effect of adding noise was investigated. The theory has been applied to colloidal particles, macromolecules, anisometric granular particles and most recently to microswimmers, for example bacteria. We study the Jeffery orbits of elongated particles subject to noise using Langevin simulations and a Fokker-Planck equation. We extend the analytical solution for infinitely thin needles ($\beta=1$) obtained by Doi and Edwards to particles with arbitrary shape factor ($0\le \beta\le 1$) and validate the theory by comparing it with simulations. We examine the rotation of the particle around the vorticity axis and study the orientational order matrix. We use the latter to obtain scalar order parameters $s$ and $r$ describing nematic ordering and biaxiality from the orientational distribution function. The value of $s$ (nematic ordering) increases monotonically with increasing P\'eclet number, while $r$ (measure of biaxiality) displays a maximum value. From perturbation theory we obtain simple expressions that provide accurate descriptions at low noise (or large P\'eclet numbers). We also examine the orientational distribution in the v-grad v plane and in the perpendicular direction. Finally we present the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system. For the same noise amplitude the average rotation speed of the particle in 3D is larger than in 2D.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this article, I summarise two centuries of research on turbulence. I also critically discuss some of the interpretations that are still in use, as turbulence remains an inherently non-linear problem that is still unsolved to this day. In the second part, I tell the story of how Alex Grossmann introduced me to the continuous wavelet representation in 1983, and how he instantly convinced me that this is the tool I was looking for to study turbulence. In the third part, I present a selection of results I obtained in collaboration with several students and colleagues to represent, analyse and filter different turbulent flows using the continuous wavelet transform. I have chosen to present both these theories and results without the use of equations, in the hope that the reading of this article will be more enjoyable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article reports on measurements of the electrostatic charge of particles in a turbulent duct flow. In contrast to previous charge measurements, which do not apply to turbulent flows or give only the sum of all particles' charges, the new method resolves the charge of a turbulent powder flow spatially. The experiment consists of a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) system and electrode plates that generate an electric field. By comparing particle velocities and accelerations with and without the electric field, the time-averaged local particle charge profile is derived. Spatially resolving the charge profiles unveiled bipolar particle flow. The average of the charge profiles agreed well with a conventional Faraday pail measurement, demonstrating the accuracy of our measurements. However, the peak value of the charge profiles was 76 times higher than the average of the particles' charge.</description>

      <title>The impact of microscale physics in continuous time random walks for hydrodynamic dispersion in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach has been widely applied to model large-scale non-Fickian transport in the flow through disordered media. Often, the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms and disorder characteristics are not known, and their effect on large-scale solute dispersion is encoded by a heavy-tailed transition time distribution. Here we study how the microscale physics manifests in the CTRW framework, and how it affects solute dispersion. To this end, we consider transport in disordered media with random sorption and random flow properties. Both disorder mechanisms can give rise to anomalous particle transport. We present the CTRW models corresponding to each of these physical scenarios to discuss the different manifestations of microscale heterogeneity on large-scale dispersion depending on the particle injection modes. The combined impact of random sorption and advection is studied with a novel CTRW model that explicitly represents both microscale disorder mechanisms. While random advection and sorption may show similar large-scale transport behaviors, they can be clearly distinguished in their response to uniform injection conditions, and, in general, to initial particle distributions that are not flux-weighted. These findings highlight the importance of the microscale physics for the interpretation and prediction of anomalous dispersion phenomena in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Generalizable improvement of the Spalart-Allmaras model through assimilation of experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on the use of model and data fusion for improving the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions of separated flows. In particular, our goal is to develop of models that not-only assimilate sparse experimental data to improve performance in computational models, but also generalize to unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman Filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via a parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients for separated flows. Despite using of observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D-bump and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for external, unseparated flows, such as flow around a NACA-0012 airfoil without any danger of extrapolation, and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model are targeted towards specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of steady laminar flow of a shear-thinning fluid in rectangular ducts, which is encountered in many systems, in particular, in microfluidic and biomedical devices. However, an exact solution for the flow of non-Newtonian fluids that considers a realistic shear-thinning rheological behavior is not available in the literature. In this study, an accurate solution for the case of Carreau fluid is obtained and investigated numerically. The numerical solution allows us to analyze the effects of the fluid rheology and the aspect ratio of the rectangular duct on the velocity field and pressure gradient that drives the flow. The relationship between the pressure gradient and the Carreau number is found to follow the rheological curve of the shear-thinning fluid. The analysis shows that the fluid rheology and the aspect ratio have independent contributions to the integral flow characteristics. Moreover, separate consideration of these contributions allows us to arrive at universal scaling and general formulae for the pressure gradient and friction factor for various rheological parameters of the fluid and aspect ratios of rectangular ducts.</description>

      <title>Elasto-Inertial Instability in Torsional Flows of Shear-Thinning Viscoelastic Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that inertia-free shearing flows of a viscoelastic fluid with curved streamlines, such as the torsional flow between a rotating cone and plate, or the flow in a Taylor-Couette geometry, can become unstable to a three-dimensional time-dependent instability at conditions exceeding a critical Weissenberg (Wi) number. However, the combined effects of fluid elasticity, shear thinning, and finite inertia (as quantified by the Reynolds number Re) on the onset of elasto-inertial instabilities are not fully understood. Using a set of cone-plate geometries, we experimentally explore the entire Wi - Re phase space for a series of rate-dependent viscoelastic fluids (quantified using a shear thinning parameter $\beta_P$). We tune $\beta_P$ by varying the polymer concentration in solutions. This progressively reduces shear-thinning but leads to finite inertial effects before the onset of elastic instability, thus naturally resulting in elasto-inertial coupling. Transient rheometric measurements and flow visualization experiments allow us to investigate the effects of flow geometry and document the combined effects of varying Wi, Re, and $\beta_P$ on the emergence of secondary motions at the onset of instability. The resulting critical state diagram quantitatively depicts the competition between the stabilizing effects of shear thinning and the destabilizing effects of inertia. We extend the curved streamline instability criterion of Pakdel and McKinley 1996 for the onset of purely elastic instability in curvilinear geometries by using scaling arguments to incorporate shear thinning and finite inertial effects. The augmented condition facilitates predictions of the onset of instability over a broader range of flow conditions, thus bridging the gap between purely elastic and elasto-inertial curved streamline instabilities.</description>

Abstract: Multiscale phenomena manifest across various scientific domains, presenting a ubiquitous challenge in accurately and effectively simulating multiscale dynamics in complex systems. In this paper, a novel decoupling solving mode is proposed through modelling large-scale dynamics independently and treating small-scale dynamics as a slaved system. A Spectral Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is developed to characterize the small-scale system in an efficient and accurate way. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, including one-dimensional Kuramot-Sivashinsky equation, two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, showcasing its versatility in addressing problems of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also delve into the application of the proposed approach to more complex problems, including non-uniform meshes, complex geometries, large-scale data with noise, and high-dimensional small-scale dynamics. The discussions about these scenarios contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. This paper presents a valuable and promising approach to enhance the computational simulations of multiscale spatiotemporal systems, which enables the acquisition of large-scale data with minimal computational demands, followed by Spectral PINN to capture small-scale dynamics with improved efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Understanding Latent Timescales in Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Models for Advection-Dominated Dynamical Systems</title>

Abstract: The neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework has shown promise in developing accelerated surrogate models for complex systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In PDE-based systems, neural ODE strategies use a two-step approach for acceleration: a nonlinear dimensionality reduction via an autoencoder, and a time integration step through a neural-network based model (neural ODE). This study explores the effectiveness of autoencoder-based neural ODE strategies for advection-dominated PDEs. It includes predictive demonstrations and delves into the sources of model acceleration, focusing on how neural ODEs achieve this. The research quantifies the impact of autoencoder and neural ODE components on system time-scales through eigenvalue analysis of dynamical system Jacobians. It examines how various training parameters, like training methods, latent space dimensionality, and training trajectory length, affect model accuracy and latent time-scales. Particularly, it highlights the influence of training trajectory length on neural ODE time-scales, noting that longer trajectories enhance limiting time-scales, with optimal neural ODEs capturing the largest time-scales of the actual system. The study conducts demonstrations on two distinct unsteady fluid dynamics settings influenced by advection: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations and Hydrogen-Air channel detonations, using the compressible reacting Navier--Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>

Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortex stability in draining fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices with more than a single circulation quantum are usually unstable and decay into clusters of smaller vortices. One way to prevent the decay is to place the vortex at the centre of a convergent (draining) fluid flow, which tends to force vortices together. It is found that whilst the primary splitting instability is suppressed in this way (and completely quenched for strong enough flows) a secondary instability can emerge in circular trapping geometries. This behaviour is related to an instability of rotating black holes when superradiantly amplified waves are confined inside a reflective cavity. The end state of the secondary instability is dramatic, manifesting as a shock wave that propagates round the circular wall and nucleates many more vortices.</description>
