      <title>The fractal geometry of opinion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce and study a variant of the agent-based opinion dynamics proposed in a recent work [8], within the framework of an interacting multi-agent system, where agents are assumed to interact with each other and update their opinions after each pairwise encounter. Specifically, our opinion model involves a large crowd of $N$ indistinguishable agents, each characterized by an opinion value ranging within the interval $[-1,1]$. At each update time, two agents are picked uniformly at random and the opinion of one agent will either shift by a proportion $\mu_+ \in (0,1]$ towards $+1$, or by a proportion $\mu_- \in (0,1]$ towards $-1$, with probabilities depending on the other agent's opinion. We rigorously derive the mean-field limit PDE that governs the large-population limit of the agent-based model and present several quantitative results demonstrating convergence to the unique equilibrium distribution. Remarkably, for a suitable choice of model parameters, the long-term equilibrium opinion profile displays a striking self-similar structure that generalizes the celebrated Bernoulli convolution, a topic extensively studied in the context of fractal geometry [23,44]. These findings also enhance our understanding of the opinion fragmentation phenomenon and may provide valuable insights for the development of more sophisticated models in future research.</description>

      <title>Trimmed branching random walk and a free obstacle problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $N$ particles performing random walks on the $\epsilon$-grid $(\epsilon Z)^d$, $\epsilon&gt;0$ with branching and density-dependent selection: When one of the particles branches, a particle is removed from the most populated site. The walks are assumed to be asymptotic, as $\epsilon\to0$, to diffusion processes of the form \[ dX_i(t)=b(X_i(t))dt+\sqrt{2}dW_i(t), \] for $b$ a given vector field. Denoting $L^*=\Delta-\nabla\cdot(b\,\cdot)$, the hydrodynamic limit, as $N\to\infty$ followed by $\epsilon\to0$, is characterized in terms of a parabolic free obstacle problem \[ \partial_t u=L^*u+u-\beta \] where $\beta$ is a measure on $R^d\times[0,\infty)$ supported on $\{(x,t):u(x,t)=|u(\cdot,t)|_\infty\}$. Here, the unknowns are $u$, the mass density, and $\beta$, the removal measure, for which $t\mapsto\beta(R^d\times[0,t])$ is prescribed. This is analogous to the well-understood relation between particle systems with spatial selection and free boundary problems, but the techniques require quite different ideas. The key ingredients of the proof include PDE uniqueness for continuous densities and a uniform-in-$\epsilon$ estimate on modulus of continuity of prelimit densities. The work gives rise to open problems such as ``flat top'' versus ``sharp top'' solutions, which are discussed based on concrete examples.</description>

      <title>The quenched structured coalescent for diploid population models on finite graphs with large migrations and uneven offspring distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we describe a new model for the evolution of a diploid structured population backwards in time that allows for large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. The model generalizes both the mean-field model of Birkner et al. [\textit{Electron. J. Probab.} 23: 1-44 (2018)] and the haploid structured model of M\"{o}hle [\textit{Theor. Popul. Biol.} 2024 Apr:156:103-116]. We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\Psi$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments. Several examples are given and their quenched scaling limits established.</description>

      <title>Leaders in multi-type TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on $\mathbb{Z}$ with step initial condition, in which all particles have distinct types. Our main object of interest is the type of the rightmost particle -- the leader -- at large time $t$. We prove a central limit theorem for this random variable. Somewhat unexpectedly, the problem is closely connected to certain observables of voter and coalescing processes on $\mathbb{Z}$; we therefore derive their asymptotics as well. We also analyze the large-time behavior of a few other related observables, including certain multi-particle ones.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Decentralized Self-Regulating Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-regulating random walks (SRRWs) are decentralized token-passing processes on a graph allowing nodes to locally \emph{fork}, \emph{terminate}, or \emph{pass} tokens based only on a return-time \emph{age} statistic. We study SRRWs on a finite connected graph under a lazy reversible walk, with exogenous \emph{trap} deletions summarized by the absorption pressure $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}=\sum_{u\in\mathcal P_{\mathrm{trap}}}\zeta(u)\pi(u)$ and a global per-visit fork cap $q$. Using exponential envelopes for return-time tails, we build graph-dependent Laplace envelopes that universally bound the stationary fork intensity of any age-based policy, leading to an effective triggering age $A_{\mathrm{eff}}$. A mixing-based block drift analysis then yields controller-agnostic stability limits: any policy that avoids extinction and explosion must satisfy a \emph{viability} inequality (births can overcome $\Lambda_{\mathrm{del}}$ at low population) and a \emph{safety} inequality (trap deletions plus deliberate terminations dominate births at high population). Under corridor-wise versions of these conditions, we obtain positive recurrence of the population to a finite corridor.</description>

      <title>Sparsity for isotropic spherical random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple representation for isotropic spherical random fields and we discuss how it allows to discuss different notions of sparsity under isotropy. We also show how a suitable construction of sparse fields can mimic well the angular power spectrum and the polyspectra of some popular non-Gaussian fields, at the same time allowing for computationally efficient simulation algorithms. Using related ideas we also show how it is possible to obtain sparse approximations of spherical random fields which preserve isotropy, thus addressing an issue which has been raised in the Cosmological literature.</description>

      <title>Wide neural networks with general weights: convergence rate and explicit dependence on the hyper-parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Stein's method techniques introduced by Chatterjee (2008) and further extended by Kasprzak and Peccati (2022) and by Lachi\`eze-Rey and Peccati (2017), we derive novel quantitative bounds on the convergence in distribution of feed-forward fully connected neural networks (with Lipschitz activation functions) towards Gaussian processes, as the hidden layer width $n$ tends to infinity. We consider networks initialized with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights possessing sufficiently many finite moments, and i.i.d. Gaussian biases independent of the weights. Specifically, when the network is evaluated at a single input, we obtain convergence rates of order $O(n^{-1/2})$ in both total variation and Wasserstein distances. When evaluated at a general finite collection of inputs, we establish bounds of the same order in terms of the convex distance. All bounds are given in explicit and computable form. As a consequence of our estimates, we also deduce a novel convergence result in the regime where the depth of the neural network increases simultaneously with the width $n$, up to order $O\big((\log_2 n)^{1/3}\big)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLT in the infinite width/depth limit holding for general (nonlinear) Lipschitz activation functions and non-Gaussian weight distributions. Our analysis yields several results of independent interest, including: (i) an explicit lower bound on the determinant of the limiting covariance matrix and (ii) new advances in Stein's method, both for the one-dimensional Stein's equation associated with the square of a Lipschitz function and for the multivariate Stein's equation associated with the tensor product of a Lipschitz function with itself.</description>

      <title>On sample complexity for covariance estimation via the unadjusted Langevin algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sample complexity guarantees for estimating the covariance matrix of strongly log-concave smooth distributions using the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA). We quantitatively compare our complexity estimates on single-chain ULA with embarrassingly parallel ULA and derive that the sample complexity of the single-chain approach is smaller than that of embarrassingly parallel ULA by a logarithmic factor in the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed precision, with the difference arising from effective bias reduction through burn-in. The key technical contribution is a concentration bound for the sample covariance matrix around its expectation, derived via a log-Sobolev inequality for the joint distribution of ULA iterates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a bona fide rough path solution for the Navier-Stokes equation with an additional rough transport term, and show that the SPDE on the three-dimensional torus driven by a fractional Brownian motion on $H^\sigma$ has solutions characterised as the effective limits of a slow/fast system. We further show that this rough path solution is equivalent to the widely used incremental notion of solution (the unbounded rough driver formulation), demonstrating broader applicability to other nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap of Metropolis Algorithms for Non-smooth Distributions under Isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metropolis algorithms are classical tools for sampling from target distributions, with broad applications in statistics and scientific computing. Their convergence speed is governed by the spectral gap of the associated Markov operator. Recently, Andrieu et al. (2024) derived the first explicit bounds for the spectral gap of Random-Walk Metropolis when the target distribution is smooth and strongly log-concave. However, existing literature rarely discuss non-smooth targets. In this work, we derive explicit spectral gap bounds for the Random-Walk Metropolis and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms over a broad class of non-smooth distributions. Moreover, combining our analysis with a recent result in Goyal et al. (2025), we extend these bounds to targets satisfying a Poincare or log-Sobolev inequality, beyond the strongly log-concave setting. Our theoretical results are further supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that among all unit-speed paths, a straight line minimises the expected escape time from a ball in $\mathbf{R}^n$, solving the min-mean variant of Bellman's Lost in a Forest problem for ball-shaped forests. The proof uses the Kneser--Poulsen conjecture in the plane, together with results on polygonal chain straightening in higher dimensions. Moreover, we calculate this minimal escape time by deriving the expected linear distance to the boundary of a ball in $n$ dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the empirical measure of moderately interacting particle systems subject to singular forces derived by Lennard-Jones potential. Although the classical Lennard-Jones force is widely used in molecular dynamics, analytical results are not available. We consider a Lennard-Jones potential with free parameters in the McKean-Vlasov framework and proceed with a regularization at the mesoscale letting the particles interact moderately. We prove the well-posedness of the McKean-Vlasov SDE involving such singular kernels and the convergence of the empirical measure towards the solution of the McKean-Vlasov Fokker-Planck PDE, by means of a semigroup approach. We derive both the range of parameters characterizing the aggregation and repulsive force and the mesoscale order for which the convergence is achieved, by obtaining the right integrability regularity of the drift.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion and anomalous regularization in self-similar random incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a particle in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, subject to molecular diffusion and advection by a random incompressible flow. The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $\gamma &gt; 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $\gamma \ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-\gamma)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\nabla \cdot (\nu I_d + \mathbf{k} ) \nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^\gamma$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $\gamma^{\frac12}\left| \log \gamma \right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are H\"older continuous with exponent $1 - C\gamma^{\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $\nu$ and the scale.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of large population symmetric games, approximate Nash equilibria are introduced through equilibrium solutions of the corresponding mean field game in the sense that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation under such strategies converges to zero in the large population size asymptotic. We show that these strategies satisfy an $\L^\infty$ notion of approximate Nash equilibrium which guarantees that the individual gain from optimal unilateral deviation is small uniformly among players and uniformly on their initial characteristics. We establish these results in the context of static models and in the dynamic continuous time setting, and we cover situations where the agents' criteria depend on the conditional law of the controlled state process.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional learning dynamics of multi-pass Stochastic Gradient Descent in multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the learning dynamics of a multi-pass, mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure for empirical risk minimization in high-dimensional multi-index models with isotropic random data. In an asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and data dimension $d$ increase proportionally, for any sub-linear batch size $\kappa \asymp n^\alpha$ where $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and for a commensurate ``critical'' scaling of the learning rate, we provide an asymptotically exact characterization of the coordinate-wise dynamics of SGD. This characterization takes the form of a system of dynamical mean-field equations, driven by a scalar Poisson jump process that represents the asymptotic limit of SGD sampling noise. We develop an analogous characterization of the Stochastic Modified Equation (SME) which provides a Gaussian diffusion approximation to SGD.
  Our analyses imply that the limiting dynamics for SGD are the same for any batch size scaling $\alpha \in [0,1)$, and that under a commensurate scaling of the learning rate, dynamics of SGD, SME, and gradient flow are mutually distinct, with those of SGD and SME coinciding in the special case of a linear model. We recover a known dynamical mean-field characterization of gradient flow in a limit of small learning rate, and of one-pass/online SGD in a limit of increasing sample size $n/d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Comparability in Bruhat orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the sharp asymptotic scale of the probability that two uniformly random permutations are comparable in weak Bruhat order, showing that $\mathbb{P}(\sigma_1 \preceq_W \sigma_2)=\exp\Bigl(\bigl(-\tfrac12+o(1)\bigr)\,n\log n\Bigr)$. This significantly improves both of the best known bounds, due to Hammett and Pittel, which placed this probability between $\exp((-1+o(1))n\log n)$ and $\exp(-\Theta(n))$. We also improve the best known lower bound for strong Bruhat-order comparability, due to the same authors, by proving a subexponential lower bound. The Bruhat orders are natural partial orders on the symmetric group, appearing in wide-reaching settings including the geometry of flag manifolds, the representation theory of $\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, and the combinatorics of the permutohedron. To analyze weak Bruhat order, we combine classic analytic, tableau-theoretic, and poset-theoretic tools, including the Plancherel measure and the RSK bijection. For strong Bruhat order we construct large families where members are comparable with high probability. Our proof that members are comparable combines the tableau criterion with an associated random-walk-type deviation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tsetlin library is a random shuffling process on permutations of $n$ letters, where each letter $i$ can be interpreted as a book; book $i$ is brought to the front of the bookshelf with an assigned probability $x_i$. We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces four matrix normal distributions extending the separable covariance $ \varPhi \otimes \varPsi$ with potentially variable-level ($ \varPsi$) and/or sample-level ($ \varPhi$) correlations. The joint distribution of sample variances and covariances, leading to the product-moment distribution, is considered when precision matrices admit a specific tensor form. Several well-known results, including the non-central Wishart distribution and normal quadratic forms, now appear as corollaries. Moreover, we propose a conjecture concerning the analytic continuation of the real gamma distribution. By applying these results to the flag varieties, we classify the double flag and the single flag.</description>

      <title>Nonhomogeneous boundary condition for spectral non-local operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study semilinear non-local elliptic problems driven by spectral-type operators of the form $\psi(-L_{|D})$ in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonhomogeneous boundary condition. Here $\psi$ is a Bernstein function satisfying a weak scaling condition at infinity, and $L_{|D}$ is the generator of a killed L\'evy process. This general framework covers and extends the theory of the interpolated fractional Laplacian. A key novelty in this setting is the analysis of the nonhomogeneous boundary condition formulated in terms of the Poisson potential with respect to the $d-1$ Hausdorff measure on $\partial D$. We establish sharp boundary estimates for Green and Poisson potentials, introduce a weak $L^1$ trace-like boundary operator, and provide existence results for solutions under quite general nonlinearities, including sign-changing and non-monotone cases. The methodology combines stochastic process techniques, potential theory, and spectral analysis, and expresses the boundary behavior of the solution in terms of the renewal function and the distance to the boundary, suggesting a possible unified treatment of semilinear boundary problems in non-local settings.</description>

      <title>Unique Continuation Property for Stochastic Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental and surprising phenomenon in the theory of stochastic wave equations: the restoration of the unique continuation property (UCP) across characteristic hypersurfaces, a property that is known to fail generically in the deterministic setting. We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $\Gamma$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $\Gamma$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical H\"ormander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves.
  Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the It\^o diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models.
  These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting.</description>

Abstract: We compute the mixing time of the Facilitated Exclusion Process (FEP) and obtain cutoff and pre-cutoff in different regimes. The main tool to obtain this result is a new bijective, deterministic mapping between the joint law of an ergodic FEP and its current through the origin, and the joint law of a Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP) and its current through the origin. This mapping is interesting in itself, as it remains valid in the non-ergodic regime where it gives a coupling between the position of a tagged particle in the FEP and the current through the origin in a SSEP with traps.</description>

      <title>Counting domino and lozenge tilings of reduced domains with Pad\'{e}-type approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying gap probabilities in a class of discrete determinantal point processes with double contour integral kernels. This class of point processes includes uniform measures of domino and lozenge tilings as well as their doubly periodic generalizations. We use a Fourier series approach to simplify the form of the kernels and to characterize gap probabilities in terms of Riemann-Hilbert problems.
  As a first illustration of our approach, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of domino tilings of reduced Aztec diamonds in terms of Pad\'e approximants, by solving the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem explicitly. As a second application, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of lozenge tilings of (simply connected) reduced hexagons in terms of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants. For more complicated domains, such as hexagons with holes, the number of tilings involves a generalization of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants.</description>

      <title>CLT for $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights, application to the KLS conjecture in Schatten balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the $\beta$-ensembles (or 1D log-gas) with Freud weights, namely with a potential of the form $|x|^{p}$ with $p \geq 2$. Since this potential is not of class $\mathcal{C}^{3}$ when $p \in (2,3]$, most of the literature does not apply. In this singular setting, we prove a central limit theorem for linear statistics with general test-functions. Our strategy relies on establishing an optimal local law in the spirit of [Bourgade, Mody, Pain 22'. Our results allow us to give a consistency check of the KLS conjecture for the uniform distributions on $p$-Schatten balls and the functions $f(X)=\mathrm{Tr}\left(X^r\right)^q$. While the case $p&gt;3$, $q=1$, $r=2$ was proven in [Dadoun, Fradelizi, Gu\'edon, Zitt 23'], we address in the present paper the case $p\geq2$, $q\geq1$ and $r\geq2$ an even integer. The proofs are based on a link between the moments of norms of uniform laws on $p$-Schatten balls and the $\beta$-ensembles with Freud weights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the expectation of the operator norm of the random matrix (a_{ij} X_{ij}) for i,j &lt;= n, under the assumption that the random variables (X_{ij}) are independent, symmetric and satisfy the moment growth condition ||X_{ij}||{2p} &lt;= C ||X_{ij}||{p} for every p &gt;= 1. We derive an upper bound expressed in terms of quantities that can be explicitly computed in many cases. This bound implies a two-sided estimate, up to a factor given by a power of an iterated logarithm. This factor is considerably smaller than the natural scale of the problem. Our result thus provides positive evidence supporting a conjecture formulated by Rafal Latala and Jan Swiatkowski.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for Rough Fractional Brownian Motion via Operator Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic formulation of stochastic calculus for fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H in (0, 1/2). The approach is based on adjointness between stochastic integration and differentiation in the Cameron-Martin space of the driving process. For Gaussian Volterra processes, we establish a canonical factorization of fluctuations (Id - E) = delta_X Pi_X D_X, where D_X := delta_X^* is the operator-covariant derivative (adjoint of the stochastic integral), delta_X the divergence, and Pi_X the predictable projection. In the rough fractional regime, the factorization yields explicit derivative formulas for cylindrical functionals, controlled expansions of conditional expectations with O(|t-s|^{2H}) remainders, and an intrinsic identification of the Gubinelli derivative as the predictable component Pi_X D_X F. The framework extends to mixed semimartingale-rough processes, providing a unified calculus without requiring iterated integrals or signature constructions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus as Operator Factorization An Operator-Covariant Derivative and Unified Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an operator-theoretic framework underlying classical stochastic calculus, based on a derivation, a divergence operator, and a predictable projection acting on an abstract energy space. Within this setting, centered random variables admit a factorization as the divergence of their projected derivative, yielding a unified representation principle that recovers classical Clark-Ocone formulas under standard representation assumptions.
  Stochastic integrals, Ito-type identities, and quadratic variation appear as coordinate realizations of deterministic operator identities rather than primitive objects. The framework applies uniformly to Gaussian and non-Gaussian drivers possessing the representation property, including Levy processes, and clarifies the structural role of predictable projection in stochastic integration. Extensions and applications are discussed, emphasizing the separation between operator-level identities and their probabilistic representations.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation property of Banach space-valued random feature models including random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08410v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Banach space-valued extension of random feature learning, a data-driven supervised machine learning technique for large-scale kernel approximation. By randomly initializing the feature maps, only the linear readout needs to be trained, which reduces the computational complexity substantially. Viewing random feature models as Banach space-valued random variables, we prove a universal approximation result in the corresponding Bochner space. Moreover, we derive approximation rates and an explicit algorithm to learn an element of the given Banach space by such models. The framework of this paper includes random trigonometric/Fourier regression and in particular random neural networks which are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks whose weights and biases are randomly initialized, whence only the linear readout needs to be trained. For the latter, we can then lift the universal approximation property of deterministic neural networks to random neural networks, even within function spaces over non-compact domains, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. In addition, we analyze when the training costs for approximating a given function grow polynomially in both the input/output dimension and the reciprocal of a pre-specified tolerated approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a numerical example the empirical advantages of random feature models over their deterministic counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. Indeed, in many natural situations, while the nominal set of actions may be large, there also exist significant correlations between the rewards of different actions. In this paper we propose an algorithm that can significantly reduce the action space when such correlations are present, without the need to a-priori know the correlation structure. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through empirical comparisons with Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is presumably a folklore result that any infinite-dimensional Banach space admits a probability measure annihilating all finite-dimensional subspaces, as the pushforward measure of an infinite product of Rademacher-type probability measures by a well-chosen random element depending on a linearly independent sequence shows. It also seems to be a generic property of probability measures which are not supported on a finite-dimensional subspace, even when the conditions of the existence of Gaussian measures on the Banach space are not met. In this short article, we provide an original method for constructing such probability measures in all generality using only an atomless probability measure on an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ instead of infinite-product measures. Anecdotally, prime numbers and one of their distribution laws are used. In the process, we show the existence of an uncountable measurable family of independent vectors having the cardinality of the continuum in any infinite-dimensional Banach space.</description>

Abstract: We consider Kramers-Fokker-Planck operators with general degenerate coefficients. We prove semiclassical hypocoercivity estimates for a large class of such operators. Then, we manage to prove Eyring-Kramers formulas for the bottom of the spectrum of some particular degenerate operators in the semiclassical regime, and quantify the spectral gap separating these eigenvalues from the rest of the spectrum. The main ingredient is the construction of sharp Gaussian quasimodes through an adaptation of the WKB method.</description>

Using Riemann$-$Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages $$Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\geq 1} \left(1+\mathrm{e}^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac{1}{2}-s)}\right)^{-1} \right] $$ for fixed $\eta&gt;0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$. We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions. The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe. Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D Toda equation with step-like initial data.</description>

      <title>Weaker quantization dimension results for self-similar measures</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of self-similar measures, particularly when the IFS does not satisfy the separation condition, but the sub-IFS at some level satisfies the separation condition. Further, we study the approximation of the space of Borel probability measures $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^m)$ with respect to the geometric mean error, i.e., the quantization dimension of order zero.</description>
