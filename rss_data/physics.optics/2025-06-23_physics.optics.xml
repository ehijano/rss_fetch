      <title>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</description>

      <title>Slow Light Augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity for Enhanced Sensitivity in Measuring Frequency Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that a slow-light augmented unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer (SLAUMZI) can be used to enhance significantly the sensitivity of measuring the frequency shift of a laser, compared to the conventional technique of heterodyning with a reference laser. Here, we show that a similar enhancement can be realized using a slow-light augmented Fabry-Perot Cavity (SLAFPC), due to the fact that an FPC is inherently unbalanced, since different bounces of the field traverse different path lengths before interfering with the other bounces. We show how the degree of enhancement in sensitivity depends on the spectral width of the laser and the finesse of the FPC. We also show how the sensitivity enhancement factor (SEF) for the SLAFPC is much larger than the same for the SLAUMZI for comparable conditions and the same group index, under lossless conditions. In general, the effect of the loss caused by the medium that produces the slow-light process is more prominent for the SLAFPC than the SLAUMZI. However, if the attenuation per pass can be kept low enough while producing a high group index, using cold atoms for generating the slow-light effect, for example, then the SEF for the SLAFPC can be much higher than that for the SLAUMZI. For potentially realizable conditions, we show that an SEF of ~1.4*10^5 can be achieved using a SLAFPC.</description>

      <title>Active, reactive and instantaneous optical forces on small particles in the time domain: Ultrafast attosecond subcycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered reactive optical forces have nule time-average of their instantaneous values on monochromatic illumination, so that their detection suggests the use of ultrafast optics, specially in the femto and attosecond domains. By using illumination with subcycle attosecond evanescent pulses, we report a theoretical study of the time variations of reactive forces versus those of active and instantaneous ones on small resonant particles that we consider dipolar; and show their corresponding pushing or pulling effects. We address illumination with subcycle attosecond pulses; \rr and demonstrate three remarkable novel effects on electric dipoles; namely, a lateral force, a pulling force against the canonical and Poynting momenta of the wavefield, and a levitating effect on the particle under repetition of the pulse. We expect that this study inaugurates a novel research in the area of optical manipulation. Future developments and experiments based on this theory should increase the insight and operation of the ultrafast dynamics of nanostructures</description>

      <title>Enhanced Absorption in Thin-Film Silicon Solar Cells Using a Broadband Plasmonic Nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and fabrication of a metal-dielectric-metal absorber that achieves strong absorption from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (near-IR) spectrum are presented. The proposed nanostructure consists of a periodic titanium (Ti) array as the top layer, a thin silicon dioxide (SiO2) spacer, and a continuous aluminum (Al) layer serving as the back reflector. Comprehensive optimization of structural parameters results in an average absorptance of 96% in the 280-1000 nm wavelength range. The proposed design exhibits polarization insensitivity and maintains high absorption efficiency under oblique incidence. Fabrication is carried out using electron beam lithography followed by a lift-off process, ensuring both high performance and manufacturing simplicity. Experimental measurements show strong agreement with numerical simulations, validating the effectiveness of the design. Furthermore, integration of the absorber into a thin-film silicon (Si) solar cell is analyzed, revealing significant enhancement in light absorption within the active layer. Owing to its broadband response, angular robustness, and structural simplicity, the proposed absorber shows strong potential for applications in solar energy harvesting, thermal emission, and advanced photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical centrifuge for nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the creation of an optical centrifuge for the controlled rotation of levitated nanorotors within an optical tweezer. The optical centrifuge is created by rapidly rotating the linear polarization of the tightly focused optical field used to form an optical trap. We show that nanorotors, formed by anisotropic nanoparticles levitated within the trap, can be accelerated to well-defined rotational rates in excess of 100 MHz over durations of hundreds of microseconds. The initial conditions required for stable acceleration, based on optical trap properties and the anisotropic susceptibility of the nanorotor are established, and confirmed by numerical simulations. We also present initial experiments that have developed tools for the rapid angular acceleration of the polarization vector of the linearly polarized beam that is required to create the centrifuge. We show that over the acceleration durations in the 100 $\upmu$s range, high rotational speeds could be achieved in modest vacuum.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic properties of individual bismuth nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth nanoparticles are being investigated due to their reported photothermal and photocatalytic properties. In this study, we synthesised spherical bismuth nanoparticles (50-600 nm) and investigated their structural and optical properties at the single particle level using analytical transmission electron microscopy. Our experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrate that bismuth nanoparticles support localised surface plasmon resonances, which can be tuned from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet spectral region by changing the nanoparticle size. Furthermore, plasmonic resonances demonstrate stability across the entire spectral bandwidth, enhancing the attractiveness of bismuth nanoparticles for applications over a wide spectral range. Bismuth's lower cost, biocompatibility, and oxidation resistance make it a suitable candidate for utilisation, particularly in industrial and large-scale plasmonic applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasmonic optical absorption of the silica glasses containing copper selenide nanoparticles is simulated on the basis of Drude theory. The plasmonic resonance absorption is studied in dependence on plasmonic frequency, damping factor and the matrix dielectric function. The charge carrier concentration in the nanoparticles is evaluated through the plasmonic frequency for the spectra of closest correspondence to experimental. The plasmon resonance position and the width of maxima are varied throughout the visible and near-IR ranges for the above parameters of experimental glasses with Cu2-xSe nanoparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Five devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, and polarization splitter rotator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory. We compare simulation accuracy, runtime, and transmission spectra across varying resolutions and bandwidths. Results reinforce that both solver are reliable with minimal discrepancies. Overall, Tidy3D is well suited for rapid prototyping while Lumerical FDTD remains a robust option for complex simulations.</description>

      <title>Polar solitons in a nonpolar chiral soft matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar solitons, i.e., solitonic waves accompanying asymmetry of geometry or phase, have garnered attention in polar systems, such as ferroelectric or magnetoelectric materials, where they play a critical role in topological transitions and nonreciprocal responses to external fields. A key question is whether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic polarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with nematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an alternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a pair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While head-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail collision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of solitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions, can be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field. Simulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through balancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric effect drives their rotational behaviors. The discovery of polar solitons in nonpolar systems expands the understanding of topological solitons, opening new avenues for dynamic control in soft matter systems, with potential applications in nonreciprocal responsive materials and topological information storage.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional plasmonic nanomotors driven by Optical Pulling Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the band structure and the dynamics of topological singularities of magneto-optical Moir\'e bound states in the continuum (BICs), which originate from two overlapped conventional magneto-optical BIC gratings with mismatched periods. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry by applying an external magnetic field in different directions can effectively manipulate the Moir\'e BICs' topological singularities, which exhibit a high Q factor throughout the momentum space.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Zernike-Lyapunov Framework for Aberration-Based Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction of Chaotic Optical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies chaotic wavefront dynamics with classical aberration theory through a Statistical Wavefront Reconstruction Framework (SWRF) formalism. By establishing rigorous connections between ray trajectory deflections and wave-optical phase perturbations through the eikonal equation, we decompose chaotic wavefront perturbations into modified Zernike-Lyapunov hybrid expansions, establishing mathematical equivalences between Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, and traditional aberration coefficients. This chaotic aberration theory enables systematic incorporation of non-integrable wavefront dynamics into deterministic design frameworks, providing a rigorous foundation for controlled chaos in optical systems. We derive analytical relationships connecting surface chaos parameters to optical performance metrics, demonstrate the framework's validity through phase space analysis, and establish convergence criteria for the chaotic expansion. The theory reveals how chaotic surface geometries can be intentionally designed to achieve specific optical functionalities, including beam homogenization, speckle reduction, and novel wavefront shaping capabilities, while maintaining mathematical rigor comparable to classical aberration analysis.</description>

      <title>RS-Coded Adaptive Dynamic Network for Reliable Long-Term Information Transmission in Disturbed Multimode Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF), due to its large core diameter and high mode capacity, holds potential in high-speed communications. However, inherent modal dispersion causes output speckle distortion, and transmission characteristics are sensitive to environmental disturbances, limiting its reliable application. Conventional transmission matrix (TM) methods face challenges such as complex calibration and environmental sensitivity. Although current deep learning approaches demonstrate reconstruction potential, they struggle to overcome error accumulation caused by fiber mode drift and lack sufficient environmental adaptability. To address this, the present study proposes an adaptive transmission framework named Residual Reed-Solomon Dynamic Network (RRSDN), which integrates Reed-Solomon (RS) error correction coding with deep residual learning forming a closed-loop system that jointly optimizes encoding, transmission, and reconstruction, to tackle the key challenges of mode instability and error accumulation in dynamic scattering channels. Experimentally, high-fidelity real-time transmission of a 16*16 pixel video stream (H.265 compressed) with zero frame loss and 100% symbol accuracy was achieved under conditions of a 100-meter MMF with manually applied disturbances and no temperature control. This work proposes a solution for stable optical transmission in complex channels. Plus, it integrates error correction coding with neural network training, laying the foundation for adaptive optical systems in longer-distance and more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Controlling Enhancement of Transmitted Goos-H\"anchen Shifts: From Symmetric to Unidirectional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the Goos-H\"anchen (GH) shift in the 1940s, its deep connections to Fourier transforms and causality have led to widespread interest and applications in optics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics. Control of the shift involves both its magnitude and direction. Although resonance-enhanced GH shift under reflection has significantly expanded and facilitated its observation and application, implementations in transmission scenarios remain scarce. More importantly, discussions on the direction of the GH shift are rare, and the associated degree of freedom for controlling directional asymmetry has not been fully explored. To address these issues, we discuss a control framework for enhancing transmitted GH shifts from symmetric to asymmetric. A design with complete degrees of freedom from symmetric shift enhancement to unidirectional shift enhancement is demonstrated in transmission scenarios. The control dimension associated with directionality significantly enhances the flexibility of beam shift control, with broad application prospects in scenarios such as high-sensitivity sensing, precision measurement, optical isolators, and asymmetric optical switches.</description>

      <title>Resonance fluorescence and indistinguishable photons from a coherently driven B centre in hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become amongst the most attractive single-photon emitters in the solid state, owing to their high-quality photophysical properties, combined with the unlimited possibilities of integration offered by the host two-dimensional material. In particular, the B centres, with their narrow linewidth, low wavelength spread and controllable positioning, have raised a particular interest for integrated quantum photonics. However, to date, either their excitation or their detection has been performed non-resonantly due to the difficulty of rejecting the backreflected laser light at the same wavelength, thereby preventing to take full benefit from their high coherence in quantum protocols. Here, we make use of a narrow-linewidth emitter integrated in a hybrid metal-dielectric structure to implement crossed-polarisation laser rejection. This allows us to observe resonantly scattered photons, with associated experimental signatures of optical coherence in both continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed regimes, respectively the Mollow triplet and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference from zero-phonon-line emission. The measured two-photon interference visibility of 0.92 demonstrates the potential of B centres in hBN for applications to integrated quantum information.</description>

      <title>Directional Dark Field for Nanoscale Full-Field Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray imaging offers unique insights into material structures by visualizing X-ray scattering rather than attenuation, revealing features invisible to conventional imaging techniques. While established approaches like grating-based and speckle-based imaging have demonstrated the utility of dark-field contrast in medical diagnostics and materials science, these methods have been primarily limited to laboratory and micro-CT systems. Building on the recent demonstration of dark-field imaging at the nanoscale using transmission X-ray microscopy, we extend this technique to retrieve directional small-angle scattering information. By analyzing both a test object and human primary tooth enamel, we show that our transmission X-ray microscopy setup can successfully retrieve directional scattering information with minimal modifications of existing systems. This advancement expands the capabilities of nanoscale dark-field imaging, offering new opportunities for investigating structural properties in a wide range of scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Influence of optical self-injection on statistical properties of laser-pulse interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed optical self-injection markedly affects the emission characteristics of semiconductor lasers. In this work, we analyze its influence on the statistical properties of laser-pulse interference. We experimentally demonstrate that varying the arrival time of reflected optical pulses back into the laser cavity influences the phase-diffusion and induces an effect that, by analogy with external optical injection, we call phase locking. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of this phenomenon is also presented.</description>

      <title>Open-Path Methane Sensing via Backscattered Light in a Nonlinear Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear interferometry has widespread applications in sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging. However, most implementations require highly reflective mirrors and precise optical alignment, drastically reducing their versatility and usability in outdoor applications. This work is based on stimulated parametric down conversion (ST-PDC), demonstrating methane absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared (MIR) region by detecting near-infrared (NIR) photons using a silicon-based CMOS camera. The MIR light, used to probe methane, is diffusely backscattered from a Lambertian surface, experiencing significant transmission loss. We implement a single-mode confocal illumination and collection scheme, using a two-lens system to mode-match the interfering beams to achieve background methane detection at a distance of 4.6 meters under a 60 dB loss. Our method is also extended to real-world surfaces, such as glass, brushed metal, and a leaf, showing robust background methane sensing with various target materials.</description>

      <title>Structured Harmonic Generation via Geometric Phase Enabled Pump Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics is crucial for shaping the spatial structure of shortwave light and its interactions with matter, but achieving this through simple harmonic generation with a single pump is challenging. This study demonstrates nonlinear spin-orbit conversion using spin-dependent pump shaping via geometric phase, allowing the direct creation of desired structured harmonic waves from a Gaussian pump beam. By using the liquid-crystal flat optical elements fabricated with photoalignment, we experimentally produce higher-order cylindrically vectorial modes in second harmonic fields. We examine the vectorial spatial wavefunctions, their propagation invariance, and nonlinear spin-orbit conversion. Our results provide an efficient method for full structuring nonlinear light in broader harmonic systems, with significant applications in laser micromachining and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated optical mechanical systems have demonstrated excellent force and impulse sensitivity and are currently being developed for the creation of non-classical states of motion in these new quantum systems. An important requirement in the design of these systems is the ability to independently control and cool all three translational degrees of freedom. Here we describe the design and implementation of a stable and robust 3D velocity feedback cooling scheme with particular emphasis on creating minimal cross-talk between the independent oscillatory modes when cooling.</description>

      <title>Graphics4Science: Computer Graphics for Scientific Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer graphics, often associated with films, games, and visual effects, has long been a powerful tool for addressing scientific challenges--from its origins in 3D visualization for medical imaging to its role in modern computational modeling and simulation. This course explores the deep and evolving relationship between computer graphics and science, highlighting past achievements, ongoing contributions, and open questions that remain. We show how core methods, such as geometric reasoning and physical modeling, provide inductive biases that help address challenges in both fields, especially in data-scarce settings. To that end, we aim to reframe graphics as a modeling language for science by bridging vocabulary gaps between the two communities. Designed for both newcomers and experts, Graphics4Science invites the graphics community to engage with science, tackle high-impact problems where graphics expertise can make a difference, and contribute to the future of scientific discovery.

      <title>A control of threshold of hard excitaion mode of optomechanical system by a low-intensity seed wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optomechanical system based on two optical modes, one of which is pumped by a coherent wave, interacting with each other via a phonon mode is considered. In such a system, a hard excitation mode can be realized in the region of bistability. It is demonstrated that excitation of an optical mode with a lower frequency by a low-intensity seed wave can lead to a significant reduction of a threshold of the hard excitation mode. This decrease is due to the fact that the seed wave changes the stability of solutions in the bistability region. This leads to the fact that switching from a non-generating state to a generating one occurs at lower values of the intensity of the pump wave. The obtained result paves the way for the creation of all-optical transistors and logical elements.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</description>

      <title>Collision-assisted information scrambling on a configurable photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Collective emission of atomic nanorings around an optical nanofiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective emission of one and two circular arrays of two-level atoms surrounding an optical nanofiber. We show that the radiation eigenmodes of a single ring selectively couple to specific guided modes of the fiber, according to their symmetry, and study how the physical parameters of the system control their nature. In particular, we identify situations in which the emission toward radiation modes is highly suppressed with respect to fiber-guided modes while the lifetime of the atomic excitation is enhanced. We further address the case of two identical nanorings positioned at a distance from each other along the nanofiber. By contrast to free-space configurations, the rings can exchange excitations even at large separation through nanofiber guided modes resulting in enhanced sub- and super-radiance with respect to the single-ring case. Our findings suggest that the ring configuration is promising for the implementation of efficient and versatile light-matter nanofiber-based interfaces and the achievement of waveguide quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Towards an Experimental Device-Independent Verification of Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted to refuting local realism and confirming the quantum entanglement. To date, demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we measure a value of $1.8427 \pm 0.0038$, which is 24 standard deviations above the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the verification of indefinite causal order.</description>

      <title>Principles and Metrics of Extreme Learning Machines Using a Highly Nonlinear Fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical computing offers potential for ultra high-speed and low latency computation by leveraging the intrinsic properties of light. Here, we explore the use of highly nonlinear optical fibers (HNLFs) as platforms for optical computing based on the concept of Extreme Learning Machines. Task-independent evaluations are introduced to the field for the first time and focus on the fundamental metrics of effective dimensionality and consistency, which we experimentally characterize for different nonlinear and dispersive conditions. We show that input power and fiber characteristics significantly influence the dimensionality of the computational system, with longer fibers and higher dispersion producing up to 100 principal components (PCs) at input power levels of 30 mW, where the PC correspond to the linearly independent dimensions of the system. The spectral distribution of the PC's eigenvectors reveals that the high-dimensional dynamics facilitating computing through dimensionality expansion are located within 40~nm of the pump wavelength at 1560~nm, providing general insight for computing with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation systems. Task-dependent results demonstrate the effectiveness of HNLFs in classifying MNIST dataset images. Using input data compression through PC analysis, we inject MNIST images of various input dimensionality into the system and study the impact of input power upon classification accuracy. At optimized power levels we achieve a classification test accuracy of 88\%, significantly surpassing the baseline of 83.7\% from linear systems. Noteworthy, we find that best performance is not obtained at maximal input power, i.e. maximal system dimensionality, but at more than one order of magnitude lower. The same is confirmed regarding the MNIST image's compression, where accuracy is substantially improved when strongly compressing the image to less than 50 PCs.</description>

Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>

      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Optics with the Transfer Matrix Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is a widely used technique for modeling linear propagation of electromagnetic waves through stratified layered media. However, since its extension to inhomogeneous and nonlinear systems is not straightforward, much more computationally demanding methods such as Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) or Method of lines (MoL) are typically used. In this work, we extend the TMM framework to incorporate the effects of nonlinearity. We consider the case when strong coupling between excitons (electron-hole pairs) and photons leads to the formation of exciton-polaritons. This extension is crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of light in polariton microcavities, where nonlinearities arising from exciton-exciton interactions play a key role. We perform efficient simulations of light transmission and reflection in a multidimensional system using the plane wave basis. Additionally, we compare our extended TMM approach with the state-of-the-art admittance transfer method, and highlight the computational advantage of extended TMM for large-scale systems. The extended TMM not only provides a robust and computationally efficient numerical framework, but also paves the way for the development of future low-power nonlinear optical devices, polariton-based photonic circuits, and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fields Formulation for Electromagnetic Waves Confined in Dielectric Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an easy-to-implement numerical method for analyzing electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric rings. Our approach employs a finite-difference-based solver in cylindrical coordinates, solving a mixed electric-magnetic field formulation to accurately enforce boundary conditions and compute resonant modes. The method avoids geometric transformations; instead, it directly discretizes the Helmholtz wave equation in cylindrical coordinates and solves the resulting generalized eigenvalue problem. We validate our model against commercial solvers for various structures, including a Si3N4 ring embedded in SiO2, a ring on a thin-film-coated substrate, and a torus, achieving agreement in effective refractive indices within 0.3%. The formulation accurately captures field confinement, curvature effects, and dispersion, enabling precise determination of propagation constants and mode profiles. As an application, we model optical frequency comb generation in a high-Q microresonator, predicting a free spectral range of 99.6 GHz and a loaded quality factor of 1.6 million, corroborated by experimental measurements.</description>

Liquid crystal (LC)-based phase shifters offer a promising solution thanks to their large refractive index contrast and their low power consumption. However, it remains challenging to incorporate LCs into integrated photonics and the operating wavelength has been limited to near infrared. Here, we demonstrate a liquid-crystal-based phase shifter operating at 780 nm, a relevant wavelength for cold atom-based quantum applications, by incorporating nematic LCs (E7) into a silicon nitride (SiN) ring resonator. Our device achieves 2pi phase modulation with very low power of 2.1 nW and low driving voltages of 7 V with exceptionally low Vpi times L (half wave voltage times length) value of 0.014 V-cm, enabling precise control over light propagation in a compact footprint. This work marks a significant step toward realizing low-power, compact, and efficient LC integrated photonic circuits based on SiN platform for next-generation LiDAR and quantum optical systems.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the design and optimization of on-chip arbitrary dispersion profiles using deep photonic networks constructed from custom-designed Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These photonic networks employ optimizable waveguide tapers, enabling precise engineering of wavelength-dependent dispersion profiles. We experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-concept two-port photonic network that exhibits a highly nonintuitive triangular dispersion profile over the wavelength range of 1.54 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ to 1.58 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ while simultaneously achieving a flat-band transmission with an insertion loss of less than 0.7 dB. We also illustrate the potential of multi-port photonic networks to enhance design freedom for more complex and customizable dispersion profiles, enabling new possibilities for on-chip dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>Giant electro-optic coefficient in single crystal barium titanate on oxide insulator based Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>

Abstract: Electro-optic modulators are indispensable components of modern day photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Recently lithium niobate has emerged as a key material to realize large-bandwidth high-speed modulation, but next-generation modulators require high-density integration, low cost, low power and high performance simultaneously, which are difficult to achieve with established integrated lithium niobate photonics platforms due to its limited electro-optic coefficient. Leveraging its exceptional Pockels coefficient, barium titanate (BTO) in the thin film form has emerged as a promising alternative but the electro-optic coefficients reported in thin-film BTO often fall short of bulk values due to challenges in film growth and waveguide fabrication. Here, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the largest Pockels coefficient (r42) of 1268 pm/V in thin film BTO platform, which is very close to the bulk value. We measure it by using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, fabricated by an optimized wet-etching method for realising single-mode waveguides in single-crystal barium titanate-on-insulator grown by pulsed laser deposition. This giant r42 is extracted from a device in which the optical mode is fully confined within a single-crystal BTO waveguide. This approach contrasts with previous designs where the core material - typically silicon or silicon nitride - supports only partial confinement, resulting in an evanescent overlap with a multi-crystalline BTO layer. This highly confined BTO on insulator electro-optic modulation technology may significantly advance the field of ultra-low-power integrated photonic devices and allows for the realization of next-generation efficient and compact photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and interfering resonances in isolated van der Waals nanoresonators</title>

Abstract: The study of strong light-matter interaction in van der Waals materials is at the forefront of current research in physics and chemistry, and it can be enhanced dramatically by employing resonances. Here we present the first observation of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) realized via polaritonic interfering resonances in isolated WS$_2$ nanodisks. We experimentally validate the existence of polaritonic qBICs driven by intrinsic coupling of Mie resonances and excitons. The system exhibits exceptionally strong light-matter interaction with a measured Rabi splitting exceeding 310 meV - the largest reported value among all transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) self-hybridized systems to date. The giant coupling strength stems from qBIC-induced in-plane field enhancement, which strongly interacts with in-plane excitonic dipoles while suppressing radiative losses. Polarization-controlled measurements further demonstrate selective excitation of qBIC through switching incident polarization to specific orthogonal configurations. The observed polarization-dependent coupling provides an additional degree of freedom to control over the hybrid states' spectral characteristics and spatial field distributions. Our demonstrations provide a pathway for engineering high-quality light-matter hybrid states in compact nanostructures, with potential applications in on-chip photonics, polaritonics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Retinomorphic Vision in a Nonlinear Photonic Network Laser</title>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for hardware that mimics the brain's ability to extract structure from limited data. In the retina, ganglion cells detect features from sparse inputs via lateral inhibition, where neurons antagonistically suppress activity of neighbouring cells. Biological neurons exhibit diverse heterogeneous nonlinear responses, linked to robust learning and strong performance in low-data regimes.
  Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' photonic system where spatially-competing lasing modes in a network laser act as heterogeneous, inhibitively-coupled neurons - enabling few-shot classification and segmentation. This compact (150 micron) silicon-compatible scheme addresses key challenges in photonic computing: physical nonlinearity and spatial footprint. We report 98.05% and 87.85% accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and 90.12% on BreaKHis cancer diagnosis - outperforming software CNNs including EfficientNet in few-shot and class-imbalanced regimes. We demonstrate combined segmentation and classification on the HAM10k skin lesion dataset, achieving DICE and Jaccard scores of 84.49% and 74.80%. These results establish a new class of nonlinear photonic hardware for versatile, data-efficient neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium origin of cavity-induced resonant modifications of chemical reactivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of light-matter coupling on reaction dynamics and equilibrium properties of a single molecule inside an optical cavity. The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential, allowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products. Dynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time formulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network decomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by slow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that in both scenarios, the rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned in resonance with the relevant vibrational transition, which directly leads to the formation of the corresponding product. In addition, due to the anharmonicity of chemical reactions, cavity-induced vibrational transitions within the reactant region can also influence reaction rates even when they do not directly result in product formation. However, we found that the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the molecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency. Thus, our proof-of-concept study highlights that cavity-induced modifications of chemical reactivities in resonant conditions arise from dynamical and non-equilibrium interactions between the cavity mode and molecular vibrations, rather than from the significant changes in equilibrium properties.</description>

      <title>A non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for diffraction loss as well as polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with a slowly-varying envelope (i.e. a parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's asymptotic limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>
