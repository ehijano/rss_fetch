      <title>Correcting Contextual Deletions in DNA Nanopore Readouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of designing codes for deletion-correction and synchronization has received renewed interest due to applications in DNA-based data storage systems that use nanopore sequencers as readout platforms. In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\log n$ for a constant $C\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C&gt;1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.</description>

      <title>On QC and GQC algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constructions of quasi-cyclic (QC) and generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes from algebraic curves. Unlike previous approaches based on elliptic curves, our method applies to curves that are Kummer extensions of the rational function field, including hyperelliptic, norm-trace, and Hermitian curves. This allows QC codes with flexible co-index. Explicit parameter formulas are derived using known automorphism-group classifications.</description>

      <title>Enabling Large-Scale Channel Sounding for 6G: A Framework for Sparse Sampling and Multipath Component Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\times$ faster measurement, a 98\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Explicit List-Decodable Linearized Reed-Solomon Subspace Codes via Subspace Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sum-rank metric is the mixture of the Hamming and rank metrics. The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.
  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $\rho$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-\rho-\varepsilon$, for any desired $\rho \in (0,1)$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$.
  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius. To the best of our knowledge, this also constitutes the first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes that admit efficient list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius, thereby providing a new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under the sum-rank metric.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Design for Beam Coverage in Near-field and Far-field: A Fourier Transform Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pinsker Inequality for Bregman Divergences of Negative Tsallis Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pinsker inequality lower bounds the Kullback--Leibler divergence $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ in terms of total variation and provides a canonical way to convert $D_{\textrm{KL}}$ control into $\lVert \cdot \rVert_1$-control. Motivated by applications to probabilistic prediction with Tsallis losses and online learning, we establish a generalized Pinsker inequality for the Bregman divergences $D_\alpha$ generated by the negative $\alpha$-Tsallis entropies -- also known as $\beta$-divergences. Specifically, for any $p$, $q$ in the relative interior of the probability simplex $\Delta^K$, we prove the sharp bound \[
  D_\alpha(p\Vert q) \ge \frac{C_{\alpha,K}}{2}\cdot \|p-q\|_1^2, \] and we determine the optimal constant $C_{\alpha,K}$ explicitly for every choice of $(\alpha,K)$.</description>

      <title>MU-MIMO Uplink Timely Throughput Maximization for Extended Reality Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the cross-layer timely throughput maximization for extended reality (XR) applications through uplink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) scheduling. Timely scheduling opportunities are characterized by the peak age of information (PAoI)-metric and are incorporated into a network-side optimization problem as constraints modeling user satisfaction. The problem being NP-hard, we resort to a signaling-free, weighted proportional fair-based iterative heuristic algorithm, where the weights are derived with respect to the PAoI metric. Extensive numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of XR capacity without sacrificing the overall system throughput.</description>

      <title>Price of universality in vector quantization is at most 0.11 bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast computation of a matrix product $W^\top X$ is a workhorse of modern LLMs. To make their deployment more efficient, a popular approach is that of using a low-precision approximation $\widehat W$ in place of true $W$ ("weight-only quantization''). Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as "waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.
  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.</description>

      <title>Instance-optimal high-precision shadow tomography with few-copy measurements: A metrological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of shadow tomography in the high-precision regime under realistic measurement constraints. Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$ and a known set of observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$, the goal is to estimate expectation values $\{\mathrm{tr}(O_i\rho)\}_{i=1}^m$ to accuracy $\epsilon$ in $L_p$-norm, using possibly adaptive measurements that act on $O(\mathrm{polylog}(d))$ number of copies of $\rho$ at a time. We focus on the regime where $\epsilon$ is below an instance-dependent threshold.
  Our main contribution is an instance-optimal characterization of the sample complexity as $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$, where $\Gamma_p$ is a function of $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^m$ defined via an optimization formula involving the inverse Fisher information matrix. Previously, tight bounds were known only in special cases, e.g. Pauli shadow tomography with $L_\infty$-norm error. Concretely, we first analyze a simpler oblivious variant where the goal is to estimate an observable of the form $\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i O_i$ with $\|\alpha\|_q = 1$ (where $q$ is dual to $p$) revealed after the measurement. For single-copy measurements, we obtain a sample complexity of $\Theta(\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_p/\epsilon^2)$. We then show $\tilde{\Theta}(\Gamma_p/\epsilon^2)$ is necessary and sufficient for the original problem, with the lower bound applying to unbiased, bounded estimators. Our upper bounds rely on a two-step algorithm combining coarse tomography with local estimation. Notably, $\Gamma^{\mathrm{ob}}_\infty = \Gamma_\infty$. In both cases, allowing $c$-copy measurements improves the sample complexity by at most $\Omega(1/c)$.
  Our results establish a quantitative correspondence between quantum learning and metrology, unifying asymptotic metrological limits with finite-sample learning guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the fundamental laws governing learning dynamics, namely the conservation law and the decrease of total entropy. Within this framework, we introduce an entropy-based lifelong ensemble learning method. We evaluate its effectiveness by constructing an immunization mechanism to defend against transfer-based adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared with a naive ensemble formed by simply averaging models specialized on clean and adversarial samples, the resulting logifold achieves higher accuracy in most test cases, with particularly large gains under strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Control for UAV-Assisted Mobile Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical applications such as target tracking, where they must simultaneously sense dynamic environments, ensure reliable communication, and achieve precise control. A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method.</description>

      <title>Pool-based Active Learning as Noisy Lossy Compression: Characterizing Label Complexity via Finite Blocklength Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the theoretical limits of pool-based active learning (AL), in which a subset of instances is selectively labeled. The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Limits of Physical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.</description>

      <title>Almost Asymptotically Optimal Active Clustering Through Pairwise Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new analysis framework for clustering $M$ items into an unknown number of $K$ distinct groups using noisy and actively collected responses. At each time step, an agent is allowed to query pairs of items and observe bandit binary feedback. If the pair of items belongs to the same (resp.\ different) cluster, the observed feedback is $1$ with probability $p&gt;1/2$ (resp.\ $q&lt;1/2$). Leveraging the ubiquitous change-of-measure technique, we establish a fundamental lower bound on the expected number of queries needed to achieve a desired confidence in the clustering accuracy, formulated as a sup-inf optimization problem. Building on this theoretical foundation, we design an asymptotically optimal algorithm in which the stopping criterion involves an empirical version of the inner infimum -- the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) statistic -- being compared to a threshold. We develop a computationally feasible variant of the GLR statistic and show that its performance gap to the lower bound can be accurately empirically estimated and remains within a constant multiple of the lower bound.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Calibration of Dual-Antenna Repeaters via MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian reciprocity calibration method that consistently ensures uplink and downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Its Bayesian framework incorporates complete statistical knowledge of the signal model, noise, and prior distributions, enabling a coherent design that achieves both low computational complexity and high calibration accuracy. To further enhance phase alignment accuracy, which is critical for calibration tasks, we develop a von Mises denoiser that exploits the fact that the target parameters lie on the circle in the complex plane. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE algorithm achieves substantially improved estimation accuracy compared with conventional deterministic non-linear least-squares (NLS) methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits remarkably fast convergence, making it well suited for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>CSRv2: Unlocking Ultra-Sparse Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.</description>

      <title>How Controlling the Variance can Improve Training Stability of Sparsely Activated DNNs and CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intermediate layers of deep networks can be characterised as a Gaussian process, in particular the Edge-of-Chaos (EoC) initialisation strategy prescribes the limiting covariance matrix of the Gaussian process. Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\text{CReLU}_{\tau,m}(x)=\min(\max(x-\tau,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.</description>

      <title>Discrete Aware Tensor Completion via Convexized $\ell_0$-Norm Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank tensors, where each entry of the tensor can be chosen from a discrete finite alphabet set, such as in common image processing problems, where the entries represent the RGB values. The proposed low-rank tensor completion (TC) method builds on the conventional nuclear norm (NN) minimization-based low-rank TC paradigm, through the addition of a discrete-aware regularizer, which enforces discreteness in the objective of the problem, by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer that is approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework, in order to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach.</description>

      <title>Exact Recovery in the Data Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection in networks is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistical inference, with applications in social networks, biological systems, and communication networks. The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verd\'{u} (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.</description>

Abstract: It's well known that MDS, AMDS or self dual codes have good algebraic properties, and are applied in communication systems, data storage, quantum codes, and so on. In this paper, we focus on a class of generalized Roth-Lempel linear codes which are not not equivalent to linear codes in [21],[22] and give an equivalent condition for them or their dual to be non RS MDS, AMDS or non RS self-dual and some corresponding examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of Maximally Recoverable (MR) Grid Codes initiated by Gopalan et al. [SODA 2017]. More precisely, we study codes over an $m \times n$ grid topology with one parity check per row and column of the grid along with $h \ge 1$ global parity checks. Previous works have largely focused on the setting in which $m = n$, where explicit constructions require field size which is exponential in $n$. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the regime in which $m,h$ are constants and $n$ is growing. In this setting, we provide a number of new explicit constructions whose field size is polynomial in $n$. We further complement these results with new field size lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming and Reflection Design for RIS-ISAC Systems Under Collusion of Passive and Active Eavesdroppers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, the physical-layer security for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is studied. There is an active eavesdropper (AE) as well as a passive eavesdropper (PE), and they cooperate each other. By joint base station beamforming and RIS reflection design, we aim to achieve the best secure data communications with guaranteed sensing performance. Mathematically, taking the constraints on sensing performance and transmission power in consideration, the system secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated with respect to transmit beamforming, RIS reflection, and receive beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and is decomposed to three subproblems by applying the alternating optimization (AO). For the decomposed subproblem, we utilize the quadratic penalty method and successive convex approximation (SCA) for the solution derivation. Thereafter, an iterative numerical algorithm, referred to as the joint beamforming and reflection design (JBRD) algorithm, is proposed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Guarantees of Cellular Networks with Hardcore Regulation and Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing performance guarantees is one of the critical objectives of recent and future communication networks, toward which regulations, i.e., constraints on key system parameters, have played an indispensable role. This is the case for large wireless communication networks, where spatial regulations (e.g., constraints on intercell distance) have recently been shown, through a spatial network calculus, to be essential for establishing provable wireless link-level guarantees. In this work, we focus on performance guarantees for the downlink of cellular networks where we impose a hardcore (spatial) regulation on base station (BS) locations and evaluate how BS scheduling (which controls which BSs can transmit at a given time) impacts performance. Hardcore regulation is the simplest form of spatial regulation that enforces a minimal distance between any pair of transmitters in the network. Within this framework of spatial network calculus, we first provide an upper bound on the power of total interference for a spatially regulated cellular network, and then, identify the regimes where scheduling BSs yields better link-level rate guarantees compared to scenarios where base stations are always active. The hexagonal cellular network is analyzed as a special case. The results offer insights into what spatial regulations are needed, when to choose scheduling, and how to potentially reduce the network power consumption to provide a certain target performance guarantee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Due to increasing spectrum demand, there is discussion in the world level to share some frequencies used in terrestrial Networks (TNs) with NTNs, resulting in co-channel interference and performance degradation. This paper analyzes the interference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to evaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings indicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the interference level.</description>

      <title>Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In this context, accurate statistical modeling of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system configurations, including varying numbers of users, antennas, and degrees of CSIT staleness.</description>

      <title>On optimal solutions of classical and sliced Wasserstein GANs with non-Gaussian data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been widely applied in reinforcement and semi-supervised learning as well as computer vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search, and only a few selection methods have been proven to be theoretically optimal. One of the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on optimal parameters for population WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) setting, where the generator NN is linear, and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of optimal solutions of population WGAN beyond the LQG setting. As a basic result, closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGAN are derived when the NN has non-linear activation functions, and the data is non-Gaussian. For high-dimensional data, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein framework and show that the linear generator can be asymptotically optimal. Moreover, the original sliced WGAN only constrains the projected data marginal instead of the whole one in classical WGAN, and thus, we propose another new unprojected sliced WGAN and identify its asymptotic optimality. Empirical studies show that compared to the celebrated r-principal component analysis (r-PCA) solution, which has cubic complexity to the data dimension, our generator for sliced WGAN can achieve better performance with only linear complexity.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop First-Order Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially, we establish a strong theoretical connection between the reformulated function and the original hyper-objective by characterizing the closeness of their values and derivatives. Based on this reformulation, we propose a single-loop, first-order algorithm for linearly constrained bilevel optimization (SFLCB). We provide rigorous analyses of its non-asymptotic convergence rates, showing an improvement over prior double-loop algorithms -- form $O(\epsilon^{-3}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$. The experiments corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficiency of the proposed SFLCB algorithm. Simulation code is provided at https://github.com/ShenGroup/SFLCB.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks Learn Generic Multi-Index Models Near Information-Theoretic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In deep learning, a central issue is to understand how neural networks efficiently learn high-dimensional features. To this end, we explore the gradient descent learning of a general Gaussian Multi-index model $f(\boldsymbol{x})=g(\boldsymbol{U}\boldsymbol{x})$ with hidden subspace $\boldsymbol{U}\in \mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$, which is the canonical setup to study representation learning. We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps. This work demonstrates the ability of neural networks to effectively learn hierarchical functions with respect to both sample and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bandit-Based Rate Adaptation for a Single-Server Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of obtaining bounded time-average expected queue sizes in a single-queue system with a partial-feedback structure. Time is slotted; in slot $t$ the transmitter chooses a rate $V(t)$ from a continuous interval. Transmission succeeds if and only if $V(t)\le C(t)$, where channel capacities $\{C(t)\}$ and arrivals are i.i.d. draws from fixed but unknown distributions. The transmitter observes only binary acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) indicating success or failure. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denote a sufficiently small lower bound on the slack between the arrival rate and the capacity region. We propose a phased algorithm that progressively refines a discretization of the uncountable infinite rate space and, without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, achieves a $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log^{3.5}(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{3}\big)$ time-average expected queue size uniformly over the horizon. We also prove a converse result showing that for any rate-selection algorithm, regardless of whether $\varepsilon$ is known, there exists an environment in which the worst-case time-average expected queue size is $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Thus, while a gap remains in the setting without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, we show that if $\varepsilon$ is known, a simple single-stage UCB type policy with a fixed discretization of the rate space achieves $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{2}\big)$, matching the converse up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Composite Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Privacy and Stability with Generalization Guarantees in Quantum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified information-theoretic framework elucidating the interplay between stability, privacy, and the generalization performance of quantum learning algorithms. We establish a bound on the expected generalization error in terms of quantum mutual information and derive a probabilistic upper bound that generalizes the classical result by Esposito et al. (2021). Complementing these findings, we provide a lower bound on the expected true loss relative to the expected empirical loss. Additionally, we demonstrate that $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-quantum differentially private learning algorithms are stable, thereby ensuring strong generalization guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to dishonest learning algorithms, introducing Information-Theoretic Admissibility (ITA) to characterize the fundamental limits of privacy when the learning algorithm is oblivious to specific dataset instances.</description>

      <title>Minimax optimal differentially private synthetic data for smooth queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private synthetic data enables the sharing and analysis of sensitive datasets while providing rigorous privacy guarantees for individual contributors. A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility.
  We study the problem of generating $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\min \{1, \frac{k}{d}\}}$, up to a $\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).</description>
