      <title>Anisotropic jet broadening and jet shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of jet substructure as a way of probing phenomena which break the isotropic behavior of jets, such as jet propagation through an anisotropically flowing quark-gluon plasma or spin correlations. We introduce two novel observables for this purpose: the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening and the azimuthal-dependent jet shape, which generalize the traditional isotropic substructure studies. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we explicitly calculate the jet functions associated with these observables with a standard jet axis and with a Winner-Take-All jet axis in both the resummed and fixed order limits. While our analysis first and foremost establishes the formalism for the azimuthal-dependent jet substructure, it also brings to light new results for jet substructure in the azimuthally integrated case, such as the semi-inclusive jet function and the exclusive jet shape for the Winner-Take-All axis, and the jet broadening in the fixed order region. As an illustrative example for the new formalism we demonstrate that the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening can be used as a direct probe of the transversity parton distribution function in deep inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Stability of Superconducting Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of superconducting strings as bound states of strings and fermion zero modes at both the classical and quantum levels. The dynamics of these superconducting strings can result in a stable configuration, known as a vorton. We mainly focus on global strings, but the majority of the discussion can be applied to local strings. Using lattice simulations, we study the classical dynamics of superconducting strings and confirm that they relax to the vorton configuration through Nambu-Goldstone boson radiation, with no evidence of over-shooting that would destabilize the vorton. We explore the tunneling of fermion zero modes out of the strings. Both our classical analysis and quantum calculations yield consistent results: the maximum energy of the zero mode significantly exceeds the fermion mass, in contrast to previous literature. Additionally, we introduce a world-sheet formalism to evaluate the decay rate of zero modes into other particles, which constitute the dominant decay channel. We also identify additional processes that trigger zero-mode decay due to non-adiabatic changes of the string configuration. In these decay processes, the rates are suppressed by the curvature of string loops, with exponential suppression for large masses of the final states. We further study the scattering with light charged particles surrounding the string core produced by the zero-mode current and find that a wide zero-mode wavefunction can enhance vorton stability.</description>

      <title>Axion strings from string axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A favored scenario for axions to be dark matter is for them to form a cosmic string network that subsequently decays, allowing for a tight link between the axion mass and relic abundance. We discuss an example in which the axion is protected from quantum gravity effects that would spoil its ability to solve the strong CP problem: namely a string theoretic axion arising from gauge symmetry in warped extra dimensions. Axion strings arise following the first-order Randall-Sundrum compactification phase transition, forming at the junctions of three bubbles during percolation. Their tensions are at the low scale associated with the warp factor, and are parametrically smaller than the usual field-theory axion strings, relative to the scale of their decay constant. Simulations of string network formation by this mechanism must be carried out to see whether the axion mass-relic density relation depends on the new parameters in the theory.</description>

      <title>Searching for hadronic scale baryonic and dark forces at $(g-2)_\mu$'s lattice-vs-dispersion front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($\,a_{\mu}\,$) provides a stringent test of the quantum nature of the Standard Model (SM) and its extensions. To probe beyond the SM physics, one needs to be able to subtract the SM contributions, which consists of a non-perturbative part, namely, the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the photon. The state of the art is to predominantly use two different methods to extract this HVP: lattice computation, and dispersion relation-based, data-driven method. Thus one can construct different forms of the ``$a_{\mu}$ test" which compares the precise measurement of $a_{\mu}$ to its theory prediction. Additionally, this opens the possibility for another subtle test, where these two ``theory" predictions themselves are compared against each other, which is denoted as the ``HVP-test". This test is particularly sensitive to hadronic scale new physics. Therefore, in this work, we consider a SM extension consisting of a generic, light $\sim(100~{\rm MeV}-1~{\rm GeV})$ vector boson and study its impact on both tests. We develop a comprehensive formalism for this purpose. We find that in the case of data-driven HVP being used in the $a_{\mu}$ test, the new physics contributions effectively cancels for a flavor-universal vector boson. As an illustration of these general results, we consider two benchmark models: i)~the dark photon ($\,A'\,$) and ii)~a gauge boson coupled to baryon-number ($\,B\,$). Using a combination of these tests, we are able to constrain the parameter space of $B$ and $A'$, complementarily to the existing limits. As a spin-off, our preliminary analysis of the spectrum of invariant mass of $3\pi$ in events with ISR at the $B-$ factories (BaBar, Belle) manifests the value of such a study in searching for $B\to 3\pi$ decay, thus motivating a dedicated search by experimental collaborations.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dirac seesaw dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw which accommodates a thermal scalar dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a CP symmetry, without introducing any additional field beyond the ones taking part in the seesaw. A $Z_4$ symmetry is introduced to realise the tree level Dirac seesaw while the Majorana mass terms are prevented by an unbroken global lepton number symmetry. While the spontaneous $Z_4$ breaking together with electroweak symmetry breaking lead to the generation of light Dirac neutrino mass, it also results in the formation of domain walls. These cosmologically catastrophic walls can be made to annihilate away by introducing bias terms while also generating stochastic gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments like LISA, BBO, $\mu$-ARES etc. The scalar DM parameter space can be probed at direct and indirect search experiments. Light Dirac neutrinos also enhance the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The model can also explain the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Functional Methods Beyond One-Loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional methods can be applied to the quantum effective action to efficiently determine counterterms and matching conditions for effective field theories. We extend the toolbox to two-loop order and beyond and show how to evaluate the expansion of the path integral in a manifestly gauge-covariant manner. We also generalize the method to theories with mixed spin statistics and prove the validity of the hard-region matching formula to all loop orders. The methods are exemplified with a two-loop matching calculation of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian resulting from decoupling the electron in QED.</description>

      <title>Heavy Neutral Leptons without Prejudice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) provide a compelling extension to the Standard Model, addressing the neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter problems. We perform a model-independent collider study, decoupling the active-sterile mixing angle ($V$) from the Yukawa coupling ($y$), and explore sensitivities at the HL-LHC for prompt and displaced decays. We also consider the possibility of HNLs being long-lived particles decaying in far detectors as FASER. In addition, we study the expected reach at FCC-ee for the prompt and displaced cases. For zero mixing, FCC-ee and HL-LHC sensitivities to $y$ are comparable, with Higgs width measurements imposing the strongest constraints. With non-zero mixing, sensitivities are dominated by $V$, significantly constraining parameter space. This work highlights the importance of precision Higgs studies and displaced searches in probing HNLs at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Important aspects of QCD factorization theorems are the properties of the objects involved that can be identified as universal. One example is that the definitions of parton densities and fragmentation functions for different types of hadrons differ only in the identity of the nonperturbative states that form the matrix elements, but are otherwise the same. This leads to independence of perturbative calculations on nonperturbative details of external states. It also lends support to interpretations of correlation functions as encapsulations of intrinsic nonperturbative properties. These characteristics have usually been presumed to still hold true in fragmentation functions even when the observed nonperturbative state is a small-mass cluster of $n$ hadrons rather than simply a single isolated hadron. However, the multidifferential aspect of cross sections that rely on these latter types of fragmentation functions complicates the treatment of kinematical approximations in factorization derivations. That has led to recent claims that the operator definitions for fragmentation functions need to be modified from the single hadron case with nonuniversal prefactors. With such concerns as our motivation, we retrace the steps for factorizing the unpolarized semi-inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross section and confirm that they do apply without modification to the case of a small-mass multihadron observed in the final state. In particular, we verify that the standard operator definition from single hadron fragmentation, with its usual prefactor, remains equally valid for the small-mass $n$-hadron case with the same hard parts and evolution kernels, whereas the more recently proposed definitions with nonuniversal prefactors do not. Our results reaffirm the reliability of most past phenomenological applications of dihadron fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>The Origin Symphony: Probing Baryogenesis with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized generically with low-energy new physics without supersymmetry while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable benchmark models, the scalar has a mass of ${\cal O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across multiple frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <title>$Z'$-Mediated Dark Matter with Low-Temperature Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple extension of the standard model with fermionic dark matter (DM) and a $Z'$ gauge boson acting as a mediator. We also assume a scenario where cosmic reheating occurs at low temperatures due to the decay of a massive inflaton into standard model states. To follow the evolution of the background and the dark sector states, we implement the required Boltzmann equations in the code micrOMEGAs to explore both the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms. We determine the parameter space of the model that satisfies the relic density constraint under different assumptions for the reheating dynamics, and examine current constraints from DM direct detection, taking special care of the scenarios where DM was produced during the reheating era. Large regions of the parameter space favored by low-temperature reheating cases are already probed or will be within the reach of future experiments, both for the WIMP and the FIMP paradigms.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Symmetry Restoration and Radiation Amplitude Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy collisions far above the electroweak scale, one expects that the effects of the electroweak symmetry breaking become parametrically small $\delta \sim M_W/E$. In this sense, the electroweak gauge symmetry is restored: $(i)$ the physics of the transverse gauge bosons and fermions is described by a massless theory in the unbroken phase; $(ii)$ the longitudinal gauge bosons behave like the Goldstone bosons and join the Higgs boson to restore the unbroken $O(4)$ symmetry in the original Higgs sector. Using the unique feature of the radiation amplitude zeros in gauge theory, we propose to study the electroweak symmetry restoration quantitatively by examining the processes for the gauge boson pair production $W^\pm \gamma,\ W^\pm Z$ and $W^\pm H$ at the LHC and a future muon collider.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Toponium Levels Using a Logarithmic Potential Modeel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the energy levels of the resonant states of toponium, composed of top quark and anti-top quark, are given on the basis of an empirical law. We predict that the mass of the n-th resonant state of toponium is given by Mass(n)=0.81ln}(n) + 347GeV from the empirical law on the resonance level of the bottomonium. The cross-section produced by electron-positron collisions is 3X10^{-9}mb and an electron-positron collider would need an energy of 270GeV X 270 GeV to find out the resonance state of toponium. This prediction is based on the empirical law that the energy levels of hadron resonance states are expressed in logarithms. An interpretation of the appearance of quark resonance states in logarithmic intervals is also given in the paper. An application of this model, we present that the Okubo-Zwig-lizuka law can be viewed as a creation 11and annihilation problem of the two-dimensional resonance planes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: True muonium, the bound state of a muon and an antimuon ($\mu^+\mu^-$), has long been theoretically predicted but remains experimentally elusive. We investigate the production of true para-muonium in the radiative decay of $J/\psi$ meson,and analyze the prospects for detecting true muonium in current and future high-energy $e^+e^-$ experiments, particularly focusing on the BESIII experiment and the proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility. Although the events are rare at the super tau-charm facility, the detection of true para-muonium via $J/\psi$ radiative decays could become feasible at its future updates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-by-light scattering is a relatively new area of experimental physics. Our recent, theoretical research shows that studying two photon measurements in regions with lower transverse momentum ($p_{t,\gamma}$) and invariant mass ($M_{\gamma\gamma}$) allows us to observe not only the main contribution of photon scattering, known as fermionic loops but also mechanisms like the VDM-Regge (double-photon hadronic fluctuation). In addition, diphoton measurements at low diphoton masses are crucial for studies of light meson resonance contributions in $\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$ scattering. We also focus on the interference between different contributions. For future experiments with the ALICE FoCal and ALICE-3 detectors, we have calculated background contamination and have explored possibilities to minimize their impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to numerically compute scattering cross sections in QCD, one needs to deal with various kinematic divergences that appear at intermediate stages of the calculation. One way of doing this is by setting up an IR subtraction scheme. In this talk we give an update on the status of extending the CoLoRFul subtraction scheme, which has been successfully used in the past for processes with only final-state hadrons, to hadron-hadron collisions. In particular we discuss the analytic computation of the integrated counterterms.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>The width of $f_{0}(980)$ in isospin-symmetry-breaking decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar meson $f_{0}(980)$ has long posed a perplexing puzzle within the realm of light hadron physics. Conventionally, its mass and width in normal decay processes have been estimated as $M=990\pm20$~MeV/$c^2$ and $\Gamma=40-100$~MeV, respectively. Theoretical explanations regarding the internal structure of $f_{0}(980)$ range from it being a conventional quark-antiquark meson to a tetraquark state, a $K\overline{K}$ molecule, or even a quark-antiquark gluon hybrid. However, a definitive consensus has remained elusive over a considerable duration. Recent observations by the BESIII experiment have unveiled anomalously narrow widths of $f_{0}(980)$ in five independent isospin-symmetry-breaking decay channels. Harnessing these experimental findings, we performed a simultaneous fit to the $\pi\pi$ invariant mass distributions, resulting in a refined determination of the mass and width in isospin-symmetry-breaking decays as $M=990.0\pm0.4(\text{stat})\pm0.1(\text{syst})$~MeV/$c^2$ and $\Gamma=11.4\pm1.1(\text{stat})\pm0.9(\text{syst})$~MeV, respectively. Here, the first errors are statistical and the second are systematic. Furthermore, by employing the parameterized Flatt\'{e} formula to fit the same $\pi\pi$ invariant mass distributions, we ascertained the values of the two coupling constants, $g_{f\pi\pi}$ and $g_{fK\overline{K}}$, as $g_{f\pi\pi}=0.46\pm0.03$ and $g_{fK\overline{K}}=1.24\pm0.32$, respectively. Based on the joint confidence regions of $g_{f\pi\pi}$ and $g_{fK\overline{K}}$, we draw the conclusion that the experimental data exhibit a propensity to favor the $K\overline{K}$ molecule model and the quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) model, while offering relatively less support for the tetraquarks ($q^{2}\bar{q}^{2}$) model and the quark-antiquark gluon ($q\bar{q}g$) hybrid model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the status of baryon form factors with a special focus on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors which are known best. First, we give an introduction into the dispersive analyses and emphasize the role of unitarity and analyticity in the construction of the isoscalar and isovector spectral functions. Second, we present the state of the art in our understanding of nucleon form factors and radii including reliable uncertainty estimates from bootstrap and Bayesian methods. Third, we discuss the physics of the time-like form factors and point out further issues to be addressed in this framework. Finally, we review the status of hyperon form factors and comment on the pion cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to explore the high-dimensional and multi-modal phase space of scattering events at high-energy particle colliders. To this end, we combine the BAT.jl package that provides implementations of a variety of MCMC algorithms with the Sherpa event generator framework. We discuss technical aspects of the implementation and the resulting algorithm and present first results for the process of $Z+3$ jets production at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma - \bar{K}N$ coupled channels model to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy spectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the lattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons with the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of the meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$ generated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.</description>

      <title>A tale of $Z$+jet: SMEFT effects and the Lam-Tung relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on dimension-six light-quark dipole operators within the Standard Model (SM) effective field theory, based on measurements of $Z$ production at SLC and LEP, as well as $Z$+jet production at the LHC. Our new constraints exclude the parameter space that could potentially explain the observed discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the Lam-Tung relation. With these updated limits, we model-independently determine the maximum possible influence that beyond-SM contributions could have on the angular coefficients $A_0$ and $A_2$, which enter the Lam-Tung relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief survey of the theory of hadronic atoms, which represent important sources of information for studying hadron interactions at very low energy. It will be namely demonstrated that a systematic expansion of the observables of hadronic atoms (the energy levels and the decay width) in terms of the fine-structure constant can be obtained, using the framework of non-relativistic effective Lagrangians. We also present a pedagogical introduction to the non-relativistic effective theories that includes a review of the main concepts, such as the scale separation, construction of the Lagrangian, power counting and matching.</description>

      <title>DiFfRG: A Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DiFfRG (Discretisation Framework for functional Renormalisation Group flows), a comprehensive computational C++ framework for solving functional Renormalisation Group flows in very general truncation schemes. Its central features are threefold: Firstly, the use of Finite Element Methods (FEM) for efficient, easy to set up and quantitatively reliable computations of field dependences. Secondly, the (simultaneous) setup of large, fully momentum-dependent vertex expansions. Thirdly, efficient time-discretisation methods, incorporating insights from studies of solving theories which exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking, going hand in hand with shocks and an exponential increase of the information flow velocity in field space. The framework provides a Mathematica package for automatic code generation of flow equations, finite and zero temperature integration routines with support for GPU hardware and extensive parallelisation capabilities. Detailed examples and tutorials are provided and discussed herein which showcase and introduce the framework to the user. We illustrate the capabilities of DiFfRG with four examples, with the complete codes fully included: finite temperature O(N) theory, a Quark-Meson model, SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and four-Fermi flows in the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Precision calculations of $B\to K^*$ form factors from SCET sum rules beyond leading-power contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13084v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ vacuum-to-$B$ meson correlation functions with interpolating currents $\bar{q}'\slashed{n}q$ and $\bar{q}'\slashed{n}\gamma_{\perp}q$ to construct light-cone sum rules (LCSR) for calculating the $B\to K^*$ form factors in the large recoil region. We investigate several subleading-power corrections to these form factors at tree level, including the next-to-leading power contributions from the hard-collinear propagator, the subleading power corrections from the effective current $\bar{q}\Gamma[i\slashed{D}_{\perp}/(2m_b)]h_v$, and four-body higher-twist effects. By utilizing the available leading-power results at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and the power corrections from higher-twist $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from our previous work, we further derive the improved numerical predictions for $B\to K^*$ form factors by applying the three-parameter model for $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). The subleading-power contribution is about $30\%$ relative to the corresponding leading-power result. Taking the well-adopted Bourrely-Caprini-Lellouch (BCL) parametrization, we then provide the numerical results of $B\to K^*$ form factors in the entire kinematic range, by adopting the combined fit to both LCSR predictions and lattice QCD results. Taking advantage of the newly obtained $B\to K^*$ form factors, we analyse the rare exclusive decay $B \to K^* \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and estimate the Standard Model predictions of $\mathcal{BR}(\bar{B}^0 \to \bar{K}^{*0} \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)=7.54(86)\times 10^{-6}$, $\mathcal{BR}(\bar{B}^+ \to \bar{K}^{*+} \nu_\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)=9.35(94)\times 10^{-6}$ and longitudinal $K^*$ polarization fraction $F_L=0.44(4)$.</description>

      <title>Higgs Factory options for CERN: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``All future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories have similar reach for the precise measurement of the Higgs boson properties.'': this popular statement has often led to the impression that all $\rm e^+e^-$ options are scientifically equivalent when it comes to choosing the future post-LHC collider at CERN. More recently, the concept of sustainability has been added in attempts to rank Higgs factories. A comparative analysis of the data currently available is performed in this note to clarify these issues for three different options: the future circular colliders (FCC), and two linear collider alternatives (CLIC and ILC@CERN).
  The main observation is as follows. For the precise measurement of already demonstrated Higgs decays (b\=b, $\tau^+\tau^-$, gg, ZZ, WW) and for $\rm H \to c\bar c$, it would take half a century to CLIC and ILC@CERN to reach the precisions that FCC-ee can achieve in 8 years thanks to its large luminosity and its four interactions points. The corresponding electricity consumption, cost and carbon footprint would also be very significantly larger with linear colliders than with FCC-ee.
  Considering in addition that (i) [...]; (ii) [...]; (iii) [...]; and {\it (iv)} the vast experimental programme achievable with both FCC-ee and FCC-hh is out of reach of linear colliders; it is found that FCC-ee is a vastly superior option for CERN, and the only first step en route to the 100\,TeV hadron collider.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic nucleon form factors in the extended vector meson dominance model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extended vector meson dominance model is developed to describe electromagnetic nucleon form factors. The model includes families of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons with the associated radial excitations. The free parameters of the model are determined using a global statistical analysis of experimental data on the electromagnetic nucleon form factors in space- and timelike regions of transferred momenta. The vector meson masses and widths are equal to their empirical values, while the residues of form factors at the poles corresponding to the ground states of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons are consistent with the findings of both the Frazer-Fulco unitarity relations and the Bonn potential for coupling constants of the $\rho$- and $\omega$-mesons with nucleons. Theoretical constraints imposed on the model include the quark counting rules, the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule, the scaling law of Sachs form factors at moderate momentum transfers, and the suppression of Sachs form factors near the nucleon-antinucleon threshold. A reasonable description of the nucleon form factors in the experimentally accessible range of transferred momenta, as well as the electric and magnetic nucleon radii and Zemach radii, is obtained.</description>

      <title>Exploring high-multiplicity events in high-energy proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the proton is overpopulated by gluons and is characterized as a highly dense medium at high collision energies. From this, the formation of a new state of matter called Color Glass Condensate (CGC) is expected, and an open question is whether the nonlinear effects predicted by this state are identifiable at the LHC. The multiplicity of particles produced in a hadronic collision presents as a means to adequately investigate this problem. Currently, the description of the available data for different multiplicity regimes remains a challenge. Even though different experimental collaborations have identified that the production of certain final states, in $pp$ collisions, present a modification in the behavior of high multiplicity events in relation to the case of minimum bias we still lack a way to identify the nature of those high multiplicity events: are those driven by initial-state effects, final-state effects or a mix of both? We argue that a analyzing different particle production process that can be described CGC framework, in particular, isolated photon production which is not sensitive to final-state effects, may provide a path forward in answering this question.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario of a single Majorana particle in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ $\textit{and nothing else}$. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Sustainability Strategy for the Cool Copper Collider", arXiv:2307.04084</title>

Abstract: The paper entitled "Sustainability Strategy for the Cool Copper Collider" by M. Breidenbach et al. defines a metric to weigh the electricity consumption and the carbon footprint of future Higgs factory concepts. We show that this metric is flawed in many respects and gives an incorrect representation of reality. We also demonstrates that, irrespective of the drawbacks of this particular estimator, the strategy consisting in using a metric as a multiplicative coefficient of the electricity consumption or the carbon footprint of an ensemble of colliders is fragile at best, and valueless when it comes to arguing in favour of or against such or such future Higgs Factory concept.</description>

      <title>Field Redefinitions Can Be Nonlocal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the lore establishing the allowed space of field redefinitions and show that there are essentially no restrictions. Our conclusions hold to all orders in perturbation theory and for any dispersion relation. Field redefinitions can be nonlocal, symmetry breaking, or have explicit dependence on spacetime. We address field redefinitions that can be resummed into the propagator, which demonstrates how to perform perturbative calculations away from the minimum in field space. Field redefinitions are used to derive higher-order Schwinger-Dyson equations, which imply multiparticle soft theorems. Non-standard field redefinitions are showcased using both relativistic and nonrelativistic examples.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fermion Cartography: from confinement and chiral symmetry breaking to conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, for the first time, the interplay between colour-confining and chiral symmetry-breaking dynamics in gauge-fermion systems with a general number of flavours and colours. Specifically, we work out the flavour dependence of the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking scales. We connect the QCD-like regime, in quantitative agreement with lattice data, with the perturbative conformal limit, thereby exploring uncharted region of theory space. This analysis is done within the first-principles functional renormalisation group approach to gauge-fermion systems and is facilitated by a novel approximation scheme introduced here. This novel scheme enables a relatively simple access to the confining dynamics. This allows us to investigate the whole landscape of many-flavour theories and to provide a cartography of their phase structure. In particular, we uncover a novel phase with the locking of confining and chiral dynamics at intermediate flavour numbers. We also explore the close-conformal region that displays a walking behaviour. Finally, we provide a quantitative estimate for the lower boundary of the conformal Caswell-Banks-Zaks window, with a $N^{\rm crit}_f(N_c=3)= 9.60^{+0.55}_{-0.53}$. This work offers a self-consistent framework for charting the landscape of strongly interacting gauge-fermion theories necessary to reliably study strongly coupled extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariance and generalised $\eta$ regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the $\eta$ regularisation scheme in order to develop a framework for systematically studying regularisation of loops in quantum field theory. This allows us to "solve" a set of gauge consistency conditions for families of gauge invariant regularisation schemes. We recover several known examples such as dimensional and denominator regularisations, as well as some more general solutions. We also study anomalies in chiral theories in order to carefully describe how our formalism should be properly implemented.</description>

      <title>Pauli blocking: probing beyond-mean-field effects in neutrino flavor evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino quantum kinetics in dense astrophysical environments is investigated relying on the mean-field approximation. However, it remains to be understood whether mean-field corrections could hinder flavor instabilities that are otherwise foreseen. In this paper, we heuristically explore whether beyond-mean-field effects due to neutrino degeneracy can affect the flavor conversion physics. We find that these corrections shift the stability regions for a suite of (anti)neutrino distributions; a configuration of angular distributions that is stable in the mean-field case can become unstable, or the flavor conversion of previously unstable ensembles can be damped. Our work should serve as a motivation for further understanding the limitations of the mean-field treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prospects to detect axion-like particles (ALPs) with the upcoming near-infrared telescope SPHEREx. The signal under investigation is the ALP decay into two photons. Assuming dark matter (DM) to be in the form of ALPs, we analyze the signal from the DM halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We find that SPHEREx can significantly improve current limits on the axion-photon coupling in the 0.5-3 eV ALP mass range.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of non-invertible flavor symmetries in intersecting/magnetized D-brane models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss selection rules of chiral matters in type IIA intersecting and IIB magnetized D-brane models on toroidal orbifolds. Since the chiral matters on toroidal orbifolds are labeled by a certain conjugacy class of the gauged orbifold group, the selection rules involve non-trivial fusion rules. We find that the representation of the chiral matters is described by a $D_4$ flavor symmetry for an even number of magnetic fluxes or winding numbers at tree level. Furthermore, the $D_4$ symmetry still remains even when we take into account loop effects. We also study non-perturbative effects such as D-brane instantons.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Atoms and Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict the existence of new ultralight bosons. This thesis investigates a way to discover such particles through observations of gravitational waves from binary black holes. This is possible through black hole superradiance, which spontaneously creates a "boson cloud" around a rapidly spinning black hole. The system is also known as a gravitational atom, due to its similarities with the hydrogen atom. The thesis focuses on a scenario where a gravitational atom is orbited by a binary companion. The goal is to characterize the dynamics of the system and identify the signatures left by the boson cloud on the gravitational waves emitted by the binary. The predictions can be tested with current and future interferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope and TianQin. First, I demonstrate that the cloud catalyzes the binary formation by increasing the dynamical capture cross section. I then introduce and study the ionization of the cloud, wherein the perturbation from the binary unbinds the bosons, analogous to the photoelectric effect in atomic physics. After that, I examine the accretion of the cloud on the companion black hole. To achieve realistic and complete results, I proceed to extend the treatment of ionization, as well as of the orbital resonances discussed in earlier works, to orbits with generic inclination and eccentricity. This allows to study the entire history of the system, from formation to merger. The most distinctive observational signatures of the cloud are found to be the orbital energy lost through ionization and the preference for specific inclinations and eccentricities induced by the orbital resonances.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires that the same entanglement generation occurs for either an act of measurement or particle interaction. The article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics for any particle interaction. The language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. Unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. For the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton, the language of relativistic quantum mechanics is used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and another entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Properties and Femtoscopic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the equation of state of hypernuclear matter and study the structure of neutron stars employing a chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction of the J\"{u}lich--Bonn group tuned to femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data of the ALICE collaboration, and $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi$N interactions determined from Lattice QCD calculations by the HAL QCD collaboration that reproduce the femtoscopic $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^-p$ data. We employ the ab-initio microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock theory extended to the strange baryon sector. A special focus is put on the uncertainties of the hyperon interactions and how they are effectively propagated to the composition, equation of state, and mass-radius relation of neutron stars. To such end, we consider the uncertainty due to the experimental error of the femtoscopic $\Lambda p$ data used to fix the chiral hyperon-nucleon interaction and the theoretical uncertainty, estimated from the residual cut-off dependence of this interaction. We find that the final maximum mass of a neutron star with hyperons is in the range $1.3-1.4$ $M_\odot$, in agreement with previous works. The hyperon puzzle, therefore, remains still an open issue if only two-body hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions are considered.</description>

      <title>Search for dark matter from the center of the Earth with ten years of IceCube data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter remains unresolved in fundamental physics. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which could explain the nature of dark matter, can be captured by celestial bodies like the Sun or Earth, leading to enhanced self-annihilation into Standard Model particles including neutrinos detectable by neutrino telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. This article presents a search for muon neutrinos from the center of the Earth performed with 10 years of IceCube data using a track-like event selection. We considered a number of WIMP annihilation channels ($\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$/$W^+W^-$/$b\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from 10 GeV to 10 TeV. No significant excess over background due to a dark matter signal was found while the most significant result corresponds to the annihilation channel $\chi\chi\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ for the mass $m_{\chi}=250$~GeV with a post-trial significance of $1.06\sigma$. Our results are competitive with previous such searches and direct detection experiments. Our upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP scattering are world-leading among neutrino telescopes for WIMP masses $m_{\chi}&gt;100$~GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use ``dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as $\sim$0.01%.</description>

      <title>Muon $(g-2)$ and Thermal WIMP DM in ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau} $ Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ${\rm U(1)}_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ model is anomaly-free with the Standard Model (SM) fermion content, and can make substantial contributions to the muon $(g-2)$ at the level of $\Delta a_\mu \sim O(10) \times 10^{-10}$ for $M_{Z'} \sim O(10-100)$ MeV and $g_X \sim (4 - 8) \times 10^{-4}$. In this light $Z'$ region, it was claimed that the model can also incorporate thermal WIMP dark matter (DM) if $M_{\rm DM} \sim M_{Z'}/2$. This setup relies on DM particles annihilating into SM particles through a $Z'$-mediated $s$-channel. In this work, we show that this tight relationship between $M_{Z'}$ and $M_{\rm DM}$ can be evaded or nullified both for scalar and spin-1/2 DM by considering the contributions from the dark Higgs boson ($H_1$). The dark Higgs boson plays an important role, not only because it gives mass to the dark photon but also because it introduces additional DM annihilation channels, including new final states such as $H_1 H_1$, $Z' Z'$, and $Z' H_1$. As a result, the model does not require a close mass correlation between the $Z'$ boson and dark matter $M_{\rm DM} \sim M_{Z'}/2$ any longer, allowing for a broader range of mass possibilities for both scalar and fermionic dark matter types. We explore in great details various scenarios where the $U(1)$ symmetry is either fully broken or partially remains as discrete symmetries, $Z_2$ or $Z_3$. This approach broadens the model's capacity to accommodate various WIMP dark matter phenomena in the light $Z'$ region where the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ makes a sensitive probe of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a dark gauge symmetry $U(1)_D$ that transforms nontrivially only for three right-handed neutrinos, $\nu_{1,2,3R}$. The anomaly cancellation demands that they have a dark charge $D=0,-1,+1$ assigned to $\nu_{1,2,3R}$, respectively. The dark charge is broken by two units down to a dark parity, i.e. $U(1)_D\to P_D=(-1)^D$, which stabilizes a dark matter candidate. Interestingly, the model manifestly supplies neutrino masses via joint seesaw and scotogenic mechanisms, called scotoseesaw.</description>

      <title>Axion sourcing in dense stellar matter via CP-violating couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs can source axion-like particles and QCD axions due to CP-violating axion-fermion couplings. The magnitude of the axion field depends on the stellar density and on the strength of the axion-fermion couplings. We show that even CP-violating couplings one order of magnitude smaller than existing constraints source extended axion field configurations. For axion-like particles, the axion energy is comparable to the magnetic energy in neutron stars with inferred magnetic fields of the order of $10^{13}$ G, and exceeds by more than one order of magnitude the magnetic energy content of white dwarfs with inferred fields of the order of $10^{4}$ G. On the other hand, the energy stored in the QCD axion field is orders of magnitude lower due to the smallness of the predicted CP-violating couplings. It is shown that the sourced axion field can polarize the photons emitted from the stellar surface, and stimulate the production of photons with energies in the radio band.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the thermodynamic pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques used in collider physics in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential, by direct numerical integration of Feynman diagrams in momentum space. Using this novel approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that at high baryon densities, phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>An Imperative study of the angular observables in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\ell^-\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decay and probing the footprint of new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the four-fold angular distribution of the semileptonic $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{+}(\to \Lambda \pi^{+})\ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decay and find out analytical expressions for various asymmetric and angular observables in the standard model (SM) and the relevant new physics (NP) scenarios. Using the available inputs on the form factors from the lattice, we predict the values with uncertainties of all these observables in the SM. We have considered NP effects only in $b\to c\tau^-\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ transitions, and constrain the Wilson coefficients of the model-independent beyond the SM operators from the available data on $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\nu_{\ell}$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^{+}\ell^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays. In this study, we focus on analysing the contributions to these decays in one- and two-operator scenarios. Furthermore, we test the new physics sensitivities (one or two-operator scenarios) of the different angular and asymmetric observables in $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c^+ (\to \Lambda \pi^{+}) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays and discuss the phenomenology. We observe that it will be possible to distinguish the different NP effects from one another by measuring these observables.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Charged Higgs Boson Using Multivariate Technique at Gamma-Gamma Collider</title>

Abstract: The current study explores the production of charged Higgs particles through photon-photon collisions within the Two Higgs Doublet Model context, including one-loop-level scattering amplitude of Electroweak and QED radiation. The cross-section has been scanned for plane ($m_{\phi^{0}}, \sqrt{s}$) investigating the process of $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow H^{+}H^{-}$. Three particular numerical scenarios low-$m_{H}$, non-alignment, and short-cascade are employed. Hence using $h^{0}$ for low-$m_{H^{0}}$ and $H^{0}$ for non-alignment and short-cascade scenario, the new experimental and theoretical constraints are applied.The decay channels for charged Higgs particles are examined in all the scenarios along with the analysis for cross-sections revealing that at low energy it is consistently higher for all scenarios. However as $\sqrt{s}$ increases, it reaches a peak value at 1$~$TeV for all benchmark scenarios. The branching ratio of the decay channels indicates that for non-alignment, the mode of decay $W^{\pm} h^{0}$ takes control %{} when $BR(H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm} H^{0})$ decreases at larger values of $m_{H^{0}}$.} and for short cascade the prominent decay mode remains $t\bar{b}$, while in the low-$m_{H}$ the dominant decay channel is of $W^{\pm} h^{0}$.
  In our research, we employ contemporary machine-learning methodologies to investigate the production of high-energy Higgs Bosons within a 3$ $TeV Gamma-Gamma collider. We have used multivariate approaches such as Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), LikelihoodD, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to show the observability of heavy-charged Higgs Bosons versus the most significant Standard Model backgrounds. The purity of the signal efficiency and background rejection are measured for each cut value.</description>

      <title>The Ghent Hybrid Model in NuWro: a new neutrino single-pion production model in the GeV regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05212v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-induced single-pion production constitutes an essential interaction channel in modern neutrino oscillation experiments, with its products building up a significant fraction of the observable hadronic final states. Frameworks of oscillation analyses strongly rely on Monte Carlo neutrino event generators, which provide theoretical predictions of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Thus, it is crucial to integrate state-of-the-art single-pion production models with Monte Carlo simulations to prepare for the upcoming systematics-dominated landscape of neutrino measurements. In this work, we present the implementation of the Ghent Hybrid model for neutrino-induced single-pion production in the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. The interaction dynamics includes coherently-added contributions from nucleon resonances and a non-resonant background, merged into the pythia branching predictions in the deep-inelastic regime, as instrumented by NuWro. This neutrino-nucleon interaction model is fully incorporated into the nuclear framework of the generator, allowing it to account for the influence of both initial- and final-state nuclear medium effects. We compare the predictions of this integrated implementation with recent pion production data from accelerator-based neutrino experiments. The results of the novel model show improved agreement of the generator predictions with the data and point to the significance of the refined treatment of the description of pion-production processes beyond the $\Delta$ region.</description>

Abstract: We explore the production and possible detection of a charged scalar Higgs pair $H^-H^+$ decaying into the final state $\mu\nu_{\mu}cb$ in proton-proton collisions at the LHC and its next step, the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The charged scalars are predicted within the theoretical framework of the Two-Higgs Doublet Model of type III (2HDM-III). As a test and validation of the model, we identify regions of the 2HDM-III parameter space that accommodate the current excess of events at $3\sigma$ in the process $\mathcal{BR}(t\to H^{\pm}b)\times \mathcal{BR}(H^{\pm}\to cb)$ for $M_{H^{\pm}}=130$ GeV, as reported by the ATLAS collaboration. Theoretical and additional experimental constraints are also included. Based on this, we propose realistic scenarios that could be brought under experimental scrutiny at the HL-LHC. Assuming the most favorable scenario, we predict a signal significance at the level of $5\sigma$ for a charged scalar boson mass $M_{H^{\pm}}$ in the $100-350$ GeV range.</description>

      <title>Precise interpretations of traditional fine-tuning measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover two precise interpretations of traditional electroweak fine-tuning (FT) measures that were historically missed. (i) a statistical interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the change in plausibility of a model in which a parameter was exchanged for the $Z$ boson mass relative to an untuned model in light of the $Z$ boson mass measurement. (ii) an information-theoretic interpretation: the traditional FT measure shows the exponential of the extra information, measured in nats, relative to an untuned model that you must supply about a parameter in order to fit the $Z$ mass. We derive the mathematical results underlying these interpretations, and explain them using examples from weak scale supersymmetry. These new interpretations allow us to rigorously define FT in particle physics and beyond; shed fresh light on the status of extensions to the Standard Model; and lastly, allow us to precisely reinterpret historical and recent studies using traditional FT measures.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the origin of neutrino flavor transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To account for neutrino oscillations, it was postulated that the neutrino has nonvanishing mass and each flavor eigenstate is formed by a quantum superposition of three distinct mass eigenstates, whose probability amplitudes interfere with each other during its propagation. However, I find that a neutrino or antineutrino produced by the decay of an unstable particle cannot be in such a superposition, as different mass eigenstates, if they exist, are necessarily correlated with different momentum states of the composite system produced by the decay, which would destroy the quantum coherence among these mass eigenstates. I further find that the states of a neutrino and an electron become nonseparable after their charged-current interaction. This nonseparability leads to decoherence for neutrinos propagating in matter, but was not taken into consideration in previous investigations of the matter effect. Due to this decoherence, the deficit of solar electron neutrinos cannot exceed 1/2 based on the aforementioned postulation even if the corresponding superposition of mass eigenstates can be produced. These results unambiguously show that the origin of neutrino flavor transformations needs to be revisited. I propose an alternative mechanism that can reasonably account for neutrino transformations. It is based on virtual excitation of the Z bosonic field diffusing over the space. During the propagation, the neutrino can continually excite and then immediately re-absorb a virtual Z boson. This virtual bosonic excitation produces a backaction on the neutrino, enabling it to oscillate among three flavors. When the neutrino propagates in matter, its behavior is determined by the competition between the coherent flavor transformation and decoherence effect resulting from scatterings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid framework of spin hydrodynamics is proposed that combines the results of kinetic theory for particles with spin 1/2 with the Israel-Stewart method of introducing nonequilibrium dynamics. The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in nonequilibrium processes. They are responsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved.</description>

      <title>Leptonic dipole operator with $\Gamma_2$ modular invariance in light of Muon $(g-2)_\mu$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the leptonic EDM and the LFV decays relating with the recent data of anomalous magnetic moment of muon, $(g-2)_{\mu}$ in the leptonic dipole operator. We have adopted the successful $\Gamma_2$ modular invariant model by Meloni-Parriciatu as the flavor symmetry of leptons. Suppose the anomaly of $(g-2)_{\mu}$, $\Delta a_{\mu}$ to be evidence of New Physics (NP), we have related it with the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron $\Delta a_e$, the electron EDM $d_e$ and the $\mu\to e \gamma$ decay. We found that the NP contributions to $\Delta a_{e(\mu)}$ are proportional to the lepton masses squared likewise the naive scaling $\Delta a_\ell \propto m^2_\ell$. The experimental constraint of $|d_e|$ is much tight compared with the one from the branching ratio $\mathcal{B} (\mu \to e \gamma)$ in our framework. Supposing the phase of our model parameter $\delta_{\alpha}$ for the electron to be of order one, we have estimated the upper-bound of $\mathcal{B}(\mu \to e \gamma)$, which is at most $10^{-21}-10^{-20}$. If some model parameters are real, leptonic EDMs vanish since the CP phase of the modular form due to modulus $\tau$ does not contribute to the EDM. However, we can obtain $\mathcal{B} (\mu \to e \gamma)\simeq 10^{-13}$ with non-vanishing $d_e$ in a specific case. The imaginary part of a parameter can lead to $d_e$ in the next-to-leading contribution. The predicted electron EDM is below $10^{-32}$e\,cm, while $\mathcal{B} (\mu \to e \gamma)$ is close to the experimental upper-bound. The branching ratios of $\tau\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to \mu\gamma$ are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is a popular effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff artifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order of the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et al. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of renormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the two-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and color-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we analyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate counterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the RG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional regularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities by the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called d-quark superconducting (dSC) phase within the melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical potentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan the formed twin-star parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of {the recently defined} conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in our four categories of twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints put, e.g. by Bayesian studies sometimes adjusted to agree with perturbative QCD at high densities. These analyses allow us to hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark diffusion in 2+1D and Glasma-like plasmas: evidence of a transport peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how plasma excitations affect the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient in 2+1 dimensional and Glasma-like plasmas, akin to the pre-equilibrium matter describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions at early times. We find that the transport coefficient $2\kappa$ transverse to and $\kappa_z$ along the beam direction display a qualitatively different evolution. We attribute this to the underlying excitation spectra of these systems, thus providing evidence for the existence of non-perturbative properties in the spectrum. This is accomplished by first reconstructing the diffusion coefficients using gauge-fixed correlation functions, which accurately reproduces the time evolution of $2\kappa$ and $\kappa_z$. We then modify these excitation spectra to study the impact of their non-perturbative features on the transport coefficients. In particular, we find evidence for a novel transport peak in the low-frequency spectrum that is crucial for heavy-quark diffusion. We also demonstrate that gluonic excitations are broad while scalar excitations associated with $\kappa_z$ are narrow and strongly enhanced at low momenta. Our findings indicate that the large values and dynamical properties of transport coefficients in the Glasma could originate from genuinely non-perturbative features in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Modular flavored dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries have been an appealing approach for explaining the observed flavor structure, which is not justified in the Standard Model (SM). Typically, these models require a so-called flavon field in order to give rise to the flavor structure upon the breaking of the flavor symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the flavon. Generally, in order to obtain the desired vacuum alignment, a flavon potential that includes additional so-called driving fields is required. On the other hand, allowing the flavor symmetry to be modular leads to a structure where the couplings are all holomorphic functions that depend only on a complex modulus, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters in the model. We show that these elements can be combined to simultaneously explain the flavor structure and dark matter (DM) relic abundance. We present a modular model with flavon vacuum alignment that allows for realistic flavor predictions while providing a successful fermionic DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory analysis of rare $|\Delta c|=|\Delta u|=1$ charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of $|\Delta c| = |\Delta u| = 1$ transitions using recent data on $D^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, $D^+ \to \pi ^+\,\mu^+\mu^-$, $\Lambda_c \to p\,\mu^+\mu^-$, and $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, and work out constraints on new physics Wilson coefficients $\mathcal{C}_{7,9,10}^{(\prime)}$. While results are consistent with the standard model, we find sizeable room for new physics that can be cleanly signaled with null test observables, not probed with searches in other sectors such as kaon and $b$-decays. The decay $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ requires better understanding of hadronic contributions to be competitive in the current fit. Progress can be achieved by precision study of the double differential decay rate in the dipion and dimuon masses, together with improved theory modelling and $D \to \pi \pi$ transition form factors. On the other hand, the 4-body decay is an important contributor to the future global analysis due to its angular distributions that probe complementary combinations of Wilson coefficients, and as a QCD laboratory. The decay $\Lambda_c \to p\,\ell^+\ell^-$ is the rising star due to the simplicity of a 3-body decay with available form factors from lattice QCD, sensitivity to both 4-fermion and electromagnetic dipole couplings and its null test forward-backward asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decay of the $ \Omega^{+}_{ccb} \rightarrow \Xi^{++}_{cc} ~{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$, where a triply heavy baryon with spin 1/2 decays into the observed doubly heavy baryon with spin 1/2, using QCD sum rule method in all lepton channels. We compute the six relevant vector and axial vector form factors entering the low energy matrix elements in full theory. The invariant form factors are building blocks, using the fit faction of which in terms of $ q^2 $ in whole physical region, we calculate the exclusive widths in three lepton channels. Our predictions may help the present and future experiments in the course of their search for doubly and triply heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Susy breaking soft terms in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the supersymmetry breaking soft terms for all the viable models in the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The calculations are performed in the general scenario of $u$-moduli dominance with the $s$-moduli turned on, where the soft terms remain independent of the Yukawa couplings and the Wilson lines. The results for the trilinear coupling, gaugino-masses, squared-mass parameters of squarks, sleptons and Higgs depend on the brane wrapping numbers and the susy breaking parameters. We find that unlike the Yukawa couplings which remain unchanged for the models dual under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors, the corresponding soft term parameters only match for the trilinear coupling and the mass of the gluino. This can be explained by the internal geometry where the Yukawa interactions depend only on the triangular areas of the worldsheet instantons while the soft terms have an additional dependence on the orientation-angles of D6-branes in the three two-tori. In the special limit of parameter space we find universal masses for the Higgs and the gauginos.</description>

      <title>Simple Scaling Laws for Energy Correlators in Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collider experiments involving nuclei provide a direct means of studying exotic states of nuclear matter. Recent measurements of energy correlators in both proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions reveal sizable modifications, attributable to nuclear effects, compared to proton-proton (p-p) collisions. Energy correlators, and their associated light-ray operator product expansion (OPE), allow scaling behaviors of the measured spectrum to be directly mapped to properties of the underlying quantum field theory. Here, we demonstrate for the first time how this mapping occurs in nuclear collisions, and highlight how the light-ray OPE characterizes leading nuclear effects. We show that the leading modification to the energy correlator distribution is characterized by an enhancement of the expectation value of twist-4 light-ray operators, resulting in a scaling for the ratio of the two-point correlator in nuclear matter to that in vacuum of $\sim 1+a\theta^2$ up to quantum corrections. We verify that this leading twist-4 correction accurately describes recent A-A and p-A data, and is thus sufficient to capture the scaling behavior within the angular range measured for jet radii used in nuclear experiments. Our light-ray OPE based approach lays the groundwork for a rigorous characterization of nuclear modification to energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Lambda_c$ States and $(\bar{D}N)$ Molecules Production at EicC and EIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore various $\Lambda_c$ states, including $\Lambda_c$, $\Lambda_c(2595)$, $\Lambda_c(2940)$, and the predicted $(\bar{D}N)$ hadronic molecular states, in photoproduction and electroproduction to estimate their yields at EicC and EIC. Assuming $\Lambda_c(2940)$ as either a hadronic molecular state or a three-quark state, our analysis demonstrates that its production rates are of the same order of magnitude, posing challenges in identifying its underlying structure. After considering the integral luminosity, the yields of $\Lambda_c$ excited states reach $10^6$ to $10^7$ at EicC and EIC. The $(\bar{D}N)$ molecular states with both isospin $I = 0$ and $I = 1$ are also studied, with yields reaching $10^5$, making them likely to be detectable at these facilities.</description>

      <title>Scalar resonance contributions in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly observed $T_{c\bar{s}}$ state in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction by the LHCb Collaboration, we investigate the amplitude in this decay to explore the origin and properties of this open-charm tetraquark state based on the final state interaction. The invariant mass distributions of $D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ are well reproduced by the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of the coupled channel systems $D_{s}\pi$ and $\pi\pi$. However, either only the tree-level contribution nor both the tree-level and $\pi\pi$ coupled channel scattering contributions can not to describe the experimental data well, which indicates that the $D_{s}\pi$ coupled channel scattering is required. We find the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances are dynamically generated from the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar meson interaction within the chiral unitary approach. In addition, we find the corresponding poles and also calculate the $S$-wave scattering length for the $DK$ channel, which is on the same scale as the result extracted from the experiment. We propose that the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction are molecular type particles.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to solve the SUSY $\mu$-problem in the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The bare $\mu$-term is forbidden by modular symmetry and the effective $\mu$-term is re-generated after the modulus field is stabilized. We discuss the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described in the non-linear realized SUSY scheme with nilpotent goldstino $X_{nl}$ superfield. The presence of $X_{nl}$ contributions can possibly slightly change the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value located in the vicinity of some fixed points. Natural value of $\mu_{eff}$, which is much smaller than the SUSY scale, can either be the consequence of expansion of typical modular forms in terms of the tiny deviation parameter (away from the fixed point $\omega$), or be the joint consequence of suppression from both powers of $q$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] and the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of Goldstone excitation from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the holographic approach, we investigate the interplay between the order parameter and Goldstone modes in the real-time dynamics of the chiral phase transition. By quenching the system to a different thermal bath and obtaining different kinds of initial states, we solve the real-time evolution of the system numerically. Our main focus is on studying far-from equilibrium dynamics of strongly-coupled system and universal scaling behaviors related to such dynamics. The most striking observation is that an additional prethermalization stage emerges at non-critical temperature after introducing the Goldstone modes, which is not reported in any previous studies. Some basic properties related to this additional prethermalization stage have been discussed in detail. More interestingly, we also report a new scaling relation describing non-equilibrium evolution at non-critical temperature. This additional universal behavior indicates the appearance of a non-thermal fixed point in the dynamical region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the spatial curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering an arbitrary bare action describing BSM physics, we use the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky resummation to obtain the most general non-local electroweak effective action at second order in the field strength. We also include the contribution of the functional measure to the effective action, which is found to modify the Higgs potential by shifting its vacuum value. The resulting effective action provides one-loop corrections to the $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, ultimately leading to the most general expression for the $\rho$ parameter at one-loop. The functional measure plays a pivotal role as it allows the parameterization of $\rho$ in inverse powers of the scale of new physics, while containing non-local form factors. The comparison of $\rho$ with the latest data leads to several constraints on the UV particle spectra of BSM models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of natural minerals as detectors to study the past flux of cosmic rays. This novel application of the \textit{paleo-detector} technique requires a specific approach as it needs samples that have been exposed to secondary cosmic rays for a well defined period of time. We suggest here the use of the evaporites formed during the desiccation of the Mediterranean sea ${\sim}6$ Myr ago. These minerals have been created and exposed to the air or under a shallow water basin for ${\sim}500$ kyr before being quickly submerged again by a km-scale overburden of water. We show that, by looking at the damages left in the minerals by muons in cosmic ray showers, we could detect differences in the primary cosmic ray flux during that period, as the ones expected from nearby supernova explosions, below the percent-level. We show also that little to no background from radioactive contamination and other astroparticles is expected for this kind of analysis.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the potential reconstruction method to set up a dynamical Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model, which we then use to study holographic quarkonium melting in an external magnetic field. The non-linear nature of the model allows to couple the magnetic field to the quarkonium inner structure without having to introduce back-reacting charged flavour degrees of freedom. The magnetic field dependent melting temperature is computed from the spectral functions and suggests a switch from inverse magnetic to magnetic catalysis when the magnetic field increases. We also discuss the differences due to the anisotropy brought in by the external field.</description>

      <title>Massive neutrinos and cosmic composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data probe massive neutrinos via their effects on the geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in models that alter the sound horizon.</description>

Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical dynamics of neutron in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any multipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study of neutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole magnets. Our predictions agree with the results of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with considerations of neutron storage ring with straight section and discrete magnets focusing the beam.</description>

      <title>A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for jet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$ measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find that the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a model for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters. This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from TRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the results are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$, and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length dependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the data from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and perform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the systematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and $\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated errors.</description>
