      <title>Cross-Chip Partial Reconfiguration for the Initialisation of Modular and Scalable Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The almost unlimited possibilities to customize the logic in an FPGA are one of the main reasons for the versatility of these devices. Partial reconfiguration exploits this capability even further by allowing to replace logic in predefined FPGA regions at runtime. This is especially relevant in heterogeneous SoCs, combining FPGA fabric with conventional processors on a single die. Tight integration and supporting frameworks like the FPGA subsystem in Linux facilitate use, for example, to dynamically load custom hardware accelerators. Although this example is one of the most common use cases for partial reconfiguration, the possible applications go far beyond. We propose to use partial reconfiguration in combination with the AXI C2C cross-chip bus to extend the resources of heterogeneous MPSoC and RFSoC devices by connecting peripheral FPGAs. With AXI C2C it is easily possible to link the programmable logic of the individual devices, but partial reconfiguration on peripheral FPGAs utilising the same channel is not officially supported. By using an AXI ICAP controller in combination with custom Linux drivers, we show that it is possible to enable the PS of the heterogeneous SoC to perform partial reconfiguration on peripheral FPGAs, and thus to seamlessly access and manage the entire multi-device system. As a result, software and FPGA firmware updates can be applied to the entire system at runtime, and peripheral FPGAs can be added and removed during operation.</description>

      <title>Sputtering of targets in high-intensity heavy-ion beam experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on available models and experimental data, the sputtering of target atoms in long-term experiments with intense heavy ion (HI) beams has been considered. The experiments on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei (SHN), which are carried out in laboratories around the world, are examples of such experiments encountering the target atoms sputtering in specific conditions. Rotating wheels with a relatively large target annulus area are used in these experiments to reduce the temperature and radiation loads on the target. Large areas of rotating targets allow one to reduce the sputtering yields of target atoms significantly. The question arises about the reliability of these yields in experiments on the synthesis of SHN with Z &gt; 118. These nuclei can be produced with extremely low cross sections, requiring HI beam doses exceeding 1020 particles passed through the target to observe several decay events of the thus synthesized SHN. Estimates based on approximations and simulations considered in this work are presented and compared with some data on actinide target sputtering obtained in experiments performed on the synthesis of SHN.</description>

      <title>Latest activities and results from T2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment has gone through a period of renewal over the last couple of years, with several upgrades designed to improve sensitivity to leptonic CP violation. The change that most affects future analyses is the ND280 upgrade, which will constrain interaction models in new ways. At the same time the analysis continues to be developed, both by combining with the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric measurements and with refinements to the T2K-only analysis. This proceedings describes the highlights of these analyses, and the status of the various T2K upgrades.</description>

      <title>Analytical description of the time-over-threshold method based on the time properties of plastic scintillators equipped with silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new high-granular compact time-of-flight neutron detector for the identification and energy measurement of neutrons produced in nucleus-nucleus interactions at the BM@N experiment, Dubna, Russia, at energies up to 4 AGeV is under development. The detector consists of approximately 2000 fast plastic scintillators, each with dimensions of 40$\times$40$\times$25 mm$^3$, equiped with SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier) with an active area of 6$\times$6 mm$^2$. The signal readout from these scintillators will employ a single-threshold multichannel Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) to measure their response time and amplitude using the time-over-threshold (ToT) method. This article focuses on the analytical description of the signals from the plastic scintillator detectors equipped with silicon photomultipliers. This description is crucial for establishing the ToT-amplitude relationship and implementing slewing correction techniques to improve the time resolution of the detector. The methodology presented in this paper demonstrates that a time resolution at the 70 ps level can be achieved for the fast plastic scintillator coupled with silicon photomultiplier with epitaxial quenching resistors.</description>

      <title>Microscale Fiber-Integrated Vector Magnetometer with On-Tip Field Biasing using NV Ensembles in Diamond Microcystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum sensing of magnetic fields, ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond offer high sensitivity, high bandwidth and outstanding spatial resolution while operating in harsh environments. Moreover, the orientation of defect centers along four crystal axes forms an intrinsic coordinate system, enabling vector magnetometry within a single diamond crystal. While most vector magnetometers rely on a known bias magnetic field for full recovery of three-dimensional field information, employing external 3D Helmholtz coils or permanent magnets results in bulky, laboratory-bound setups, impeding miniaturization of the device. Here, a novel approach is presented that utilizes a fiber-integrated microscale coil at the fiber tip to generate a localized uniaxial magnetic field. The same fiber-tip coil is used in parallel for spin control by combining DC and microwave signals in a bias tee. To implement vector magnetometry using a uniaxial bias field, we preselect the orientation of the diamond crystal and then fully characterize it by rotating a static magnetic field in three planes of rotation. We demonstrate the measurement of vector magnetic fields in the full solid angle with a shot-noise limited sensitivity of $19.4\:\textrm{nT/Hz}^{1/2}$ and microscale spatial resolution while achieving a cross section of the fiber sensor head below $1\:\textrm{mm}^2.$</description>

      <title>Measurement of Energy Resolution with the NEXT-White Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NEXT-White detector, a high-pressure gaseous xenon time projection chamber, demonstrated the excellence of this technology for future neutrinoless double beta decay searches using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to measure energy and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to extract topology information. This analysis uses $^{83m}\text{Kr}$ data from the NEXT-White detector to measure and understand the energy resolution that can be obtained with the SiPMs, rather than with PMTs. The energy resolution obtained of (10.9 $\pm$ 0.6) $\%$, full-width half-maximum, is slightly larger than predicted based on the photon statistics resulting from very low light detection coverage of the SiPM plane in the NEXT-White detector. The difference in the predicted and measured resolution is attributed to poor corrections, which are expected to be improved with larger statistics. Furthermore, the noise of the SiPMs is shown to not be a dominant factor in the energy resolution and may be negligible when noise subtraction is applied appropriately, for high-energy events or larger SiPM coverage detectors. These results, which are extrapolated to estimate the response of large coverage SiPM planes, are promising for the development of future, SiPM-only, readout planes that can offer imaging and achieve similar energy resolution to that previously demonstrated with PMTs.</description>
