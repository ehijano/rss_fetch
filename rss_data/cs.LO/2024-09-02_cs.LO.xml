      <title>Inductive Learning of Logical Theories with LLMs: A Complexity-graded Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel systematic methodology to analyse the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) with feedback from a formal inference engine, on logic theory induction. The analysis is complexity-graded w.r.t. rule dependency structure, allowing quantification of specific inference challenges on LLM performance. Integrating LLMs with formal methods is a promising frontier in the Natural Language Processing field, as an important avenue for improving model inference control and explainability. In particular, inductive learning over complex sets of facts and rules, poses unique challenges for current autoregressive models, as they lack explicit symbolic grounding. While they can be complemented by formal systems, the properties delivered by LLMs regarding inductive learning, are not well understood and quantified. Empirical results indicate that the largest LLMs can achieve competitive results against a SOTA Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system baseline, but also that tracking long predicate relationship chains is a more difficult obstacle than theory complexity for the LLMs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Parallelism and Interference in Game Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game semantics is a denotational semantics presenting compositionally the computational behaviour of various kinds of effectful programs. One of its celebrated achievement is to have obtained full abstraction results for programming languages with a variety of computational effects, in a single framework. This is known as the semantic cube or Abramsky's cube, which for sequential deterministic programs establishes a correspondence between certain conditions on strategies (''innocence'', ''well-bracketing'', ''visibility'') and the absence of matching computational effects. Outside of the sequential deterministic realm, there are still a wealth of game semantics-based full abstraction results; but they no longer fit in a unified canvas. In particular, Ghica and Murawski's fully abstract model for shared state concurrency (IA) does not have a matching notion of pure parallel program-we say that parallelism and interference (i.e. state plus semaphores) are entangled. In this paper we construct a causal version of Ghica and Murawski's model, also fully abstract for IA. We provide compositional conditions parallel innocence and sequentiality, respectively banning interference and parallelism, and leading to four full abstraction results. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Abramsky's semantic cube programme beyond the sequential deterministic world.</description>

      <title>Automating Semantic Analysis of System Assurance Cases using Goal-directed ASP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assurance cases offer a structured way to present arguments and evidence for certification of systems where safety and security are critical. However, creating and evaluating these assurance cases can be complex and challenging, even for systems of moderate complexity. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop new automation methods for these tasks. While most existing assurance case tools focus on automating structural aspects, they lack the ability to fully assess the semantic coherence and correctness of the assurance arguments.
  In prior work, we introduced the Assurance 2.0 framework that prioritizes the reasoning process, evidence utilization, and explicit delineation of counter-claims (defeaters) and counter-evidence. In this paper, we present our approach to enhancing Assurance 2.0 with semantic rule-based analysis capabilities using common-sense reasoning and answer set programming solvers, specifically s(CASP). By employing these analysis techniques, we examine the unique semantic aspects of assurance cases, such as logical consistency, adequacy, indefeasibility, etc. The application of these analyses provides both system developers and evaluators with increased confidence about the assurance case.</description>

      <title>Temporal Ensemble Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Temporal Ensemble Logic (TEL), a monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning. TEL includes primitive temporal constructs such as ``always up to $t$ time later'' ($\Box_t$), ``sometimes before $t$ time in the future'' ($\Diamond_t$), and ``$t$-time later'' $\varphi_t$. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and reproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and population health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in biomedicine. Existing logical frameworks such as linear temporal logic are too restrictive to express temporal and sequential properties in biomedicine, or too permissive in semantic constructs, such as in Halpern-Shoham logic, to serve this purpose. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up, with discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical development of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers $\mathbb{N}^+$, denoted as ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$ is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic second order logic, characterized by B\"{u}chi automata. We present its formal semantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the satisfiability of ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$. We also include initial results on expressiveness and decidability fragments for ${\rm TEL}_{\mathbb{N}^+}$, followed by application outlook and discussions.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Symmetric Circuits for the Determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dawar and Wilsenach (ICALP 2020) introduce the model of symmetric arithmetic circuits and show an exponential separation between the sizes of symmetric circuits for computing the determinant and the permanent. The symmetry restriction is that the circuits which take a matrix input are unchanged by a permutation applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the matrix. Under such restrictions we have polynomial-size circuits for computing the determinant but no subexponential size circuits for the permanent. Here, we consider a more stringent symmetry requirement, namely that the circuits are unchanged by arbitrary even permutations applied separately to rows and columns, and prove an exponential lower bound even for circuits computing the determinant. The result requires substantial new machinery. We develop a general framework for proving lower bounds for symmetric circuits with restricted symmetries, based on a new support theorem and new two-player restricted bijection games. These are applied to the determinant problem with a novel construction of matrices that are bi-adjacency matrices of graphs based on the CFI construction. Our general framework opens the way to exploring a variety of symmetry restrictions and studying trade-offs between symmetry and other resources used by arithmetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Lasserre Hierarchy for Graph Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feasibility of the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy for graph isomorphism can be expressed as a homomorphism indistinguishability relation. In other words, we define a class $\mathcal{L}_t$ of graphs such that graphs $G$ and $H$ are not distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any graph in $\mathcal{L}_t$. By analysing the treewidth of graphs in $\mathcal{L}_t$, we prove that the $3t^\text{th}$ level of Sherali--Adams linear programming hierarchy is as strong as the $t^\text{th}$ level of Lasserre. Moreover, we show that this is best possible in the sense that $3t$ cannot be lowered to $3t-1$ for any $t$. The same result holds for the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints, which we similarly characterise in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability over a family $\mathcal{L}_t^+$ of graphs. Additionally, we give characterisations of level-$t$ Lasserre with non-negativity constraints in terms of logical equivalence and via a graph colouring algorithm akin to the Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm. This provides a polynomial time algorithm for determining if two given graphs are distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints.</description>

      <title>An Order Theory Framework of Recurrence Equations for Static Cost Analysis $-$ Dynamic Inference of Non-Linear Inequality Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrence equations have played a central role in static cost analysis, where they can be viewed as abstractions of programs and used to infer resource usage information without actually running the programs with concrete data. Such information is typically represented as functions of input data sizes. More generally, recurrence equations have been increasingly used to automatically obtain non-linear numerical invariants. However, state-of-the-art recurrence solvers and cost analysers suffer from serious limitations when dealing with the (complex) features of recurrences arising from cost analyses. We address this challenge by developing a novel order-theoretical framework where recurrences are viewed as operators and their solutions as fixpoints, which allows leveraging powerful pre/postfixpoint search techniques. We prove useful properties and provide principles and insights that enable us to develop techniques and combine them to design new solvers. We have also implemented and experimentally evaluated an optimisation-based instantiation of the proposed approach. The results are quite promising: our prototype outperforms state-of-the-art cost analysers and recurrence solvers, and can infer tight non-linear lower/upper bounds, in a reasonable time, for complex recurrences representing diverse program behaviours.</description>
