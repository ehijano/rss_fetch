      <title>A Modular and Extensible CHARMM-Compatible Model for All-Atom Simulation of Polypeptoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptoids (N-substituted glycines) are a class of sequence-defined synthetic peptidomimetic polymers with applications including drug delivery, catalysis, and biomimicry. Classical molecular simulations have been used to predict and understand the conformational dynamics of single peptoid chains and their self-assembly into diverse morphologies including sheets, tubes, spheres, and fibrils. The CGenFF-NTOID model based on the CHARMM General ForceField has demonstrated success in enabling accurate all-atom molecular modeling of the structure and thermodynamic behavior of peptoids. Extension of this force field to new peptoid side chain chemistries has historically required parameterization of new side chain bonded interactions against ab initio and/or experimental data. This fitting protocol improves the accuracy of the force field but is also burdensome and time consuming, and precludes modular extensibility of the model to arbitrary peptoid sequences. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a Modular Side Chain CGenFF-NTOID (MoSiC-CGenFF-NTOID) as an extension of CGenFF-NTOID employing a modular decomposition of the peptoid backbone and side chain parameterizations wherein arbitrary side chain chemistries within the large family of substituted methyl groups (i.e., -CH3, -CH2R, -CHRR' -CRR'R'') are directly ported from CGenFF without any additional reparameterization. We validate this approach against ab initio calculations and experimental data to to develop a MoSiC-CGenFF-NTOID model for all 20 natural amino acid side chains along with 13 commonly-used synthetic side chains, and present an extensible paradigm to efficiently determine whether a novel side chain can be directly incorporated into the model or whether refitting of the CGenFF parameters is warranted. We make the model freely available to the community along with a tool to perform automated initial structure generation.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of ordered self-assembled structures in the liquid phase of a hard-core, square-shoulder system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase ordering (pattern formation) of systems of two-dimensional core-shell particles using Monte-Carlo (MC) computer simulations and classical density functional theory (DFT). The particles interact via a pair potential having a hard core and a repulsive square shoulder. Our simulations show that on cooling, the liquid state structure becomes increasingly characterised by long wavelength density modulations, and on further cooling forms a variety of other phases, including clustered, striped and other patterned phases. In DFT, the hard core part of the potential is treated using either fundamental measure theory or a simple local density approximation, whereas the soft shoulder is treated using the random phase approximation. The different DFTs are bench-marked using large-scale grand-canonical-MC and Gibbs-ensemble-MC simulations, demonstrating their predictive capabilities and shortcomings. We find that having the liquid state static structure factor $S(k)$ for wavenumber $k$ is sufficient to identify the Fourier modes governing both the liquid and solid phases. This allows to identify from easier-to-obtain liquid state data the wavenumbers relevant to the periodic phases and to predict roughly where in the phase diagram these patterned phases arise.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of wave-propelled capillary spinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</description>

      <title>Influence of temperature and crack-tip speed on crack propagation in elastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the influence of temperature and the crack-tip velocity of the bond breaking at the crack tip in rubber-like materials. The bond breaking is considered as a stress-aided thermally activated process and result in an effective crack propagation energy which increases strongly with decreasing temperature or increasing crack-tip speed. This effect is particular important for adhesive (interfacial) crack propagation but less important for cohesive crack propagation owing to the much larger bond-breaking energies in the latter case. For adhesive cracks the theory results are consistent with adhesion measurements for silicone (PDMS) rubber in contact with silica glass surfaces. For cohesive cracks the theory agree well with experimental results PDMS films chemically bound to silinized glass.</description>

      <title>Memory and Personality in Ideological Polarization: The Politico-physics of Mnemomatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used physical agents with deep memories of past events and left/right ideologies but different fixed personalities to study what drives the polarization of the dynamic population ideology. We find that agents have a critical memory depth below which complete ideology polarization of the collective cannot occur and above which it is inevitable. However, depending on the details of the personalities, the ideologies polarization can be static or dynamic in time, even chaotic. Thus, agents with different personalities and levels of memory (mnemomatter) can serve as a physics analogue of the ideology dynamics among ideological beings, illuminating how decisions influenced by individual memories of past interactions can shape and influence subsequent ideology polarization. Each constituent agent harbors a private stack memory and an onboard microcomputer/controller which both measures and controls its physical spin handedness, which is a proxy for ideology. The agent's decision to change or retain its current spin is determined by each agent's private algorithm for decisions (the personality) and the time-weighted stack history of present and previous interactions. Depending on a given agent's personality for evaluating its memory and experiences, an agent can act as a curmudgeon who never changes its ideology, a pushover who always accepts change, a contrarian who always does the opposite of what is expected, an opportunist who weighs recent events more heavily than past events in making decisions, and a traditionalist who weighs past events more heavily than recent events in decision making. We develop a field theory which maps agent ideological polarization over into a dynamic potential landscape. Perhaps such applications of physics-based systems to political systems will help us to understand the ideological instability observed in the world today.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic swelling of tough hydrogels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are biphasic, swollen polymer networks where elastic deformation is coupled to nanoscale fluid flow. As a consequence, hydrogels can withstand large strains and exhibit nonlinear, hyperelastic properties. For low-modulus hydrogel and semiflexible biopolymer networks, previous studies have shown that these materials universally contract when sheared on timescales much longer than the poroelastic relaxation timescale. Using rheological and tribological measurements, we find that stiff polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid hydrogels, with moduli of order ~10-100 kPa, exclusively swell (dilate) when sheared. The poroelastic relaxation process was examined using strain-controlled compression, indicating a volumetric diffusion constant of order 10^-9 m^2/s. Upon shearing, we observed an increase in normal stress that varied quadratically with shear strain, and persisted for hours. Moreover, we show that this dilatant behavior manifests as swelling during tribological sliding, imbibing the hydrogel with fluid. We suggest that this inherent, hyperelastic dilatancy is an important feature in all stiff hydrogels, and may explain rehydration and mechanical rejuvenation in biological tissues such as cartilage.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity in phase ordering: the roles of activity, noise, and non-constant mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity emerges generically in the coarsening regime of phase-separating fluids. Numerical studies of active and passive systems have shown that the structure factor $S(q)$ behaves as $q^\varsigma$ for $q\to 0$, with hyperuniformity exponent $\varsigma = 4$. For passive systems, this result was explained in 1991 by a qualitative scaling analysis of Tomita, exploiting isotropy at scales much larger than the coarsening length $\ell$. Here we reconsider and extend Tomita's argument to address cases of active phase separation and of non-constant mobility, again finding $\varsigma=4$. We further show that dynamical noise of variance $D$ creates a transient $\varsigma = 2$ regime for $\hat q\ll \hat{q}_\ast \sim \sqrt{D} t^{[1-(d+2)\nu]/2}$, crossing over to $\varsigma = 4$ at larger $\hat{q}$. Here, $\nu$ is the coarsening exponent, with $\ell\sim t^\nu$, and $\hat{q} \propto q \ell$ is the rescaled wavenumber. In diffusive coarsening, $\nu=1/3$, so the rescaled crossover wavevector $\hat{q}_\ast$ vanishes at large times when $d\geq 2$. The slowness of this decay suggests a natural explanation for experiments that observe a long-lived $\varsigma = 2$ scaling in phase-separating active fluids (where noise is typically large). Conversely, in $d=1$, we demonstrate that with noise the $\varsigma = 2$ regime survives as $t\to\infty$, with $\hat{q}_\ast\sim D^{5/6}$. (The structure factor is not then determined by the zero-temperature fixed point.) We confirm our analytical predictions by numerical simulations of active and passive continuum theories in the deterministic case and of Model B for the stochastic case. We also compare them with related findings for a system near an absorbing-state transition rather than undergoing phase separation. A central role is played throughout by the presence or absence of a conservation law for the centre of mass position of the order parameter field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active liquid crystals exert nonequilibrium stresses on their surroundings through constant consumption of energy, giving rise to dynamical steady states not present in equilibrium. The paradigmatic example of an active liquid crystal is a suspension of microtubule bundles powered by kinesin motor proteins, which exhibits self-sustained spatiotemporal chaotic flows. This system has been modelled using continuum theories that couple the microtubule orientation to active flows. Recently the focus has shifted to the interfacial properties of mixtures of active liquid crystals and passive fluids. Active/passive interfaces have been shown to support propagating capillary waves in the absence of inertia and offer a promising route for relating experimental parameters to those of the continuum theory. In this paper we report the derivation of a minimal model that captures the linear dynamics of the interface between an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid. We show that the dynamics of the interface, although powered by active flows throughout the bulk, is qualitatively captured by equations that couple non-reciprocally interface height and nematic director at the interface. This minimal model reproduces the dynamical structure factor evaluated from numerical simulations and the qualitative form of the wave dispersion relation seen in experiments.</description>

      <title>A classical density functional theory for solvation across length scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim of multiscale modeling is to use results from the Schr\"odinger Equation to predict phenomenology on length scales that far exceed those of typical molecular correlations. In this work, we present a new approach rooted in classical density functional theory (cDFT) that allows us to accurately describe the solvation of apolar solutes across length scales. Our approach builds on the Lum-Chandler-Weeks (LCW) theory of hydrophobicity [K. Lum et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 103, 4570 (1999)] by constructing a free energy functional that uses a slowly-varying component of the density field as a reference. From a practical viewpoint, the theory we present is numerically simpler and generalizes to solutes with soft-core repulsion more easily than LCW theory. Furthermore, by assessing the local compressibility and its critical scaling behavior, we demonstrate that our LCW-style cDFT approach contains the physics of critical drying, which has been emphasized as an essential aspect of hydrophobicity by recent theories. As our approach is parameterized on the two-body direct correlation function of the uniform fluid and the liquid-vapor surface tension, it straightforwardly captures the temperature dependence of solvation. Moreover, we use our theory to describe solvation at a first-principles level, on length scales that vastly exceed what is accessible to molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in partial differential equations and critical phenomena: renormalization group theory for interfacial hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar dynamics, often described by partial differential equations (PDEs) without noise terms, have been widely observed in nature and have attracted considerable attention from researchers in various fields, including physics, fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, and chemical engineering. The concept of universality class and the renormalization group (RG) theory, emerged from critical phenomena, which also have been widely observed in nature, are pillars of modern physics, with guiding the recent development of physics. While self-similarity appearing in fluid dynamics reminds physicists of critical phenomena, deep connections between them have not been explored. Here, we focus on a variation of a daily phenomenon, a drop falling from a faucet, and demonstrate self-similar dynamics for the shape of liquid-air interface in confined space with a scaling law for a characteristic length scale, which leads to a clear correspondence between the present self-similar dynamics and critical phenomena by identifying critical exponents, which define a universality class. We not only show that the observed master curve describing the self-similar shape is a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, but also develop a renormalization group (RG) theory for the governing PDE to show the fixed point of RG corresponds to the solution, which becomes stable with time due to a scaling crossover. Our results will impact on our understanding of critical, scaling, and singular behaviors widely observed in nature.</description>
