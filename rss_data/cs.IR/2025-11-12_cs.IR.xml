      <title>A Hybrid Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Intelligent Fashion Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of online fashion platforms has created an increasing demand for intelligent recommender systems capable of understanding both visual and textual cues. This paper proposes a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fashion recommendation that jointly addresses two key tasks: outfit compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an "outfit token" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset. For complementary item retrieval, a "target item token" representing the desired item description is used to retrieve compatible items, reaching an accuracy of 69.24% under the Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB) metric. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fashion recommendation.</description>

      <title>TurkEmbed4Retrieval: Turkish Embedding Model for Retrieval Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce TurkEmbed4Retrieval, a retrieval specialized variant of the TurkEmbed model originally designed for Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks. By fine-tuning the base model on the MS MARCO TR dataset using advanced training techniques, including Matryoshka representation learning and a tailored multiple negatives ranking loss, we achieve SOTA performance for Turkish retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms Turkish colBERT by 19,26% on key retrieval metrics for the Scifact TR dataset, thereby establishing a new benchmark for Turkish information retrieval.</description>

      <title>From IDs to Semantics: A Generative Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation with Adaptive Semantic Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is crucial for improving recommendation accuracy and generalization, yet traditional methods are often hindered by the reliance on shared user/item IDs, which are unavailable in most real-world scenarios. Consequently, many efforts have focused on learning disentangled representations through multi-domain joint training to bridge the domain gaps. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches show promise, they still face critical challenges, including: (1) the \textbf{item ID tokenization dilemma}, which leads to vocabulary explosion and fails to capture high-order collaborative knowledge; and (2) \textbf{insufficient domain-specific modeling} for the complex evolution of user interests and item semantics. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{GenCDR}, a novel \textbf{Gen}erative \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{R}ecommendation framework. GenCDR first employs a \textbf{Domain-adaptive Tokenization} module, which generates disentangled semantic IDs for items by dynamically routing between a universal encoder and domain-specific adapters. Symmetrically, a \textbf{Cross-domain Autoregressive Recommendation} module models user preferences by fusing universal and domain-specific interests. Finally, a \textbf{Domain-aware Prefix-tree} enables efficient and accurate generation. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GenCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>BiCA: Effective Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard negatives are essential for training effective retrieval models. Hard-negative mining typically relies on ranking documents using cross-encoders or static embedding models based on similarity metrics such as cosine distance. Hard negative mining becomes challenging for biomedical and scientific domains due to the difficulty in distinguishing between source and hard negative documents. However, referenced documents naturally share contextual relevance with the source document but are not duplicates, making them well-suited as hard negatives. In this work, we propose BiCA: Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives, an approach for hard-negative mining by utilizing citation links in 20,000 PubMed articles for improving a domain-specific small dense retriever. We fine-tune the GTE_small and GTE_Base models using these citation-informed negatives and observe consistent improvements in zero-shot dense retrieval using nDCG@10 for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks on BEIR and outperform baselines on long-tailed topics in LoTTE using Success@5. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging document link structure to generate highly informative negatives, enabling state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning and demonstrating a path towards highly data-efficient domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>DiffuGR: Generative Document Retrieval with Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) re-frames document retrieval as a sequence-based document identifier (DocID) generation task, memorizing documents with model parameters and enabling end-to-end retrieval without explicit indexing. Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.</description>

      <title>MARC: Multimodal and Multi-Task Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Cold-Start Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are currently being studied to mitigate limitations during cold-start conditions by leveraging modality information or introducing Agent concepts based on the exceptional reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, food and beverage recommender systems have traditionally used knowledge graph and ontology concepts due to the domain's unique data attributes and relationship characteristics. On this background, we propose MARC, a multimodal and multi-task cocktail recommender system based on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing graph database under cold-start conditions. The proposed system generates high-quality, contextually appropriate answers through two core processes: a task recognition router and a reflection process. The graph database was constructed by processing cocktail data from Kaggle, and its effectiveness was evaluated using 200 manually crafted questions. The evaluation used both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation to demonstrate that answers generated via the graph database outperformed those from a simple vector database in terms of quality. The code is available at https://github.com/diddbwls/cocktail_rec_agentrag</description>

      <title>Bid Farewell to Seesaw: Towards Accurate Long-tail Session-based Recommendation via Dual Constraints of Hybrid Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Scientific Knowledge Retrieval and Reuse with a Novel Digital Library for Machine-Readable Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital libraries for research, such as the ACM Digital Library or Semantic Scholar, do not enable the machine-supported, efficient reuse of scientific knowledge (e.g., in synthesis research). This is because these libraries are based on document-centric models with narrative text knowledge expressions that require manual or semi-automated knowledge extraction, structuring, and organization. We present ORKG reborn, an emerging digital library that supports finding, accessing, and reusing accurate, fine-grained, and reproducible machine-readable expressions of scientific knowledge that relate scientific statements and their supporting evidence in terms of data and code. The rich expressions of scientific knowledge are published as reborn (born-reusable) articles and provide novel possibilities for scientific knowledge retrieval, for instance by statistical methods, software packages, variables, or data matching specific constraints. We describe the proposed system and demonstrate its practical viability and potential for information retrieval in contrast to state-of-the-art digital libraries and document-centric scholarly communication using several published articles in research fields ranging from computer science to soil science. Our work underscores the enormous potential of scientific knowledge databases and a viable approach to their construction.</description>

      <title>A Decentralized Retrieval Augmented Generation System with Source Reliabilities Secured on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems typically use a centralized architecture, causing a high cost of data collection, integration, and management, as well as privacy concerns. There is a great need for a decentralized RAG system that enables foundation models to utilize information directly from data owners who maintain full control over their sources. However, decentralization brings a challenge: the numerous independent data sources vary significantly in reliability, which can diminish retrieval accuracy and response quality. To address this, our decentralized RAG system has a novel reliability scoring mechanism that dynamically evaluates each source based on the quality of responses it contributes to generate and prioritizes high-quality sources during retrieval. To ensure transparency and trust, the scoring process is securely managed through blockchain-based smart contracts, creating verifiable and tamper-proof reliability records without relying on a central authority. We evaluate our decentralized system with two Llama models (3B and 8B) in two simulated environments where six data sources have different levels of reliability. Our system achieves a +10.7\% performance improvement over its centralized counterpart in the real world-like unreliable data environments. Notably, it approaches the upper-bound performance of centralized systems under ideally reliable data environments. The decentralized infrastructure enables secure and trustworthy scoring management, achieving approximately 56\% marginal cost savings through batched update operations. Our code and system are open-sourced at github.com/yining610/Reliable-dRAG.</description>

      <title>Think Before You Retrieve: Learning Test-Time Adaptive Search with Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective information retrieval requires reasoning over partial evidence and refining strategies as information emerges. Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise.</description>

      <title>AgentPRM: Process Reward Models for LLM Agents via Step-Wise Promise and Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid development, large language models (LLMs) still encounter challenges in multi-turn decision-making tasks (i.e., agent tasks) like web shopping and browser navigation, which require making a sequence of intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.</description>

      <title>TurkEmbed: Turkish Embedding Model on NLI &amp; STS Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces TurkEmbed, a novel Turkish language embedding model designed to outperform existing models, particularly in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks. Current Turkish embedding models often rely on machine-translated datasets, potentially limiting their accuracy and semantic understanding. TurkEmbed utilizes a combination of diverse datasets and advanced training techniques, including matryoshka representation learning, to achieve more robust and accurate embeddings. This approach enables the model to adapt to various resource-constrained environments, offering faster encoding capabilities. Our evaluation on the Turkish STS-b-TR dataset, using Pearson and Spearman correlation metrics, demonstrates significant improvements in semantic similarity tasks. Furthermore, TurkEmbed surpasses the current state-of-the-art model, Emrecan, on All-NLI-TR and STS-b-TR benchmarks, achieving a 1-4\% improvement. TurkEmbed promises to enhance the Turkish NLP ecosystem by providing a more nuanced understanding of language and facilitating advancements in downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Compression then Matching: An Efficient Pre-training Paradigm for Multimodal Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Addressing Fairness Across User Groups in Negative Sampling for Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems trained on implicit feedback data rely on negative sampling to distinguish positive items from negative items for each user. Since the majority of positive interactions come from a small group of active users, negative samplers are often impacted by data imbalance, leading them to choose more informative negatives for prominent users while providing less useful ones for users who are not so active. This leads to inactive users being further marginalised in the training process, thus receiving inferior recommendations. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating that state-of-the-art negative sampling strategies provide more accurate recommendations for active users than for inactive users. We also find that increasing the number of negative samples for each positive item improves the average performance, but the benefit is distributed unequally across user groups, with active users experiencing performance gain while inactive users suffering performance degradation. To address this, we propose a group-specific negative sampling strategy that assigns smaller negative ratios to inactive user groups and larger ratios to active groups. Experiments on eight negative samplers show that our approach improves user-side fairness and performance when compared to a uniform global ratio.</description>

      <title>BroadGen: A Framework for Generating Effective and Efficient Advertiser Broad Match Keyphrase Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19164v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of {Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.5 billion items.</description>

      <title>OPERA: A Reinforcement Learning--Enhanced Orchestrated Planner-Executor Architecture for Reasoning-Oriented Multi-Hop Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2) Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge. Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM) decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Relevance Assessment for Web-Scale Search Evaluation at Pinterest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.</description>

      <title>Does Generative Retrieval Overcome the Limitations of Dense Retrieval?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in neural information retrieval, offering an alternative to dense retrieval (DR) by directly generating identifiers of relevant documents. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate how GR fundamentally diverges from DR in both learning objectives and representational capacity. GR performs globally normalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance information directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally normalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before computing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that, under scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two major benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance degradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local normalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity scales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that limits DR. We validate these theoretical insights through controlled experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, across varying negative sampling strategies, embedding dimensions, and model scales. But despite its theoretical advantages, GR does not universally outperform DR in practice. We outline directions to bridge the gap between GR's theoretical potential and practical performance, providing guidance for future research in scalable and robust generative retrieval.</description>

      <title>OneRec-Think: In-Text Reasoning for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The powerful generative capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has instigated a paradigm shift in recommendation. However, existing generative models (e.g., OneRec) operate as implicit predictors, critically lacking the capacity for explicit and controllable reasoning-a key advantage of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose OneRec-Think, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates dialogue, reasoning, and personalized recommendation. OneRec-Think incorporates: (1) Itemic Alignment: cross-modal Item-Textual Alignment for semantic grounding; (2) Reasoning Activation: Reasoning Scaffolding to activate LLM reasoning within the recommendation context; and (3) Reasoning Enhancement, where we design a recommendation-specific reward function that accounts for the multi-validity nature of user preferences. Experiments across public benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our proposed "Think-Ahead" architecture enables effective industrial deployment on Kuaishou, achieving a 0.159\% gain in APP Stay Time and validating the practical efficacy of the model's explicit reasoning capability.</description>

      <title>A Remarkably Efficient Paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendations (SR) predict users' future interactions based on their historical behavior. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought powerful generative and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhancing SR performance, while Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) further extend this by introducing data like images and interactive relationships. However, critical issues remain, i.e., (a) Suboptimal item representations caused by lengthy and redundant descriptions, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference; (b) Modality-related cognitive bias, as LLMs are predominantly pretrained on textual data, limiting their ability to effectively integrate and utilize non-textual modalities; (c) Weakening sequential perception in long interaction sequences, where attention mechanisms struggle to capture earlier interactions, hindering the modeling of long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose Speeder, an efficient MLLM-based paradigm for SR featuring three key innovations: 1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which condenses item attributes into concise yet informative tokens, reducing redundancy and computational cost; 2) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), enabling gradual learning of multimodal representations; 3) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), improving the LLM's capability to capture both relative and absolute sequential dependencies in long interaction sequences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Speeder. Speeder increases training speed to 250% of the original while reducing inference time to 25% on the Amazon dataset.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Inter-Session Information with Frequency-enhanced Dual-Path Networks for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict a user's next item preference by modeling historical interaction sequences. Recent advances often integrate frequency-domain modules to compensate for self-attention's low-pass nature by restoring the high-frequency signals critical for personalized recommendations. Nevertheless, existing frequency-aware solutions process each session in isolation and optimize exclusively with time-domain objectives. Consequently, they overlook cross-session spectral dependencies and fail to enforce alignment between predicted and actual spectral signatures, leaving valuable frequency information under-exploited. To this end, we propose FreqRec, a Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Path Network for sequential Recommendation that jointly captures inter-session and intra-session behaviors via a learnable Frequency-domain Multi-layer Perceptrons. Moreover, FreqRec is optimized under a composite objective that combines cross entropy with a frequency-domain consistency loss, explicitly aligning predicted and true spectral signatures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that FreqRec surpasses strong baselines and remains robust under data sparsity and noisy-log conditions.</description>

      <title>Hard vs. Noise: Resolving Hard-Noisy Sample Confusion in Recommender Systems via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit feedback, employed in training recommender systems, unavoidably confronts noise due to factors such as misclicks and position bias. Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.</description>

      <title>Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Speech-to-Speech Dialogue Modeling with End-to-End Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have recently garnered increasing research attention for their lower latency and more natural integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However, these systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual knowledge, which hinders effective integration of information. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant textual knowledge from speech queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency. Although the overall performance still lags behind the SOTA cascaded models, our framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in end-to-end S2S systems. Our code and dataset are released.</description>

      <title>ReCode: Updating Code API Knowledge with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.</description>

      <title>Question-to-Knowledge (Q2K): Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Diversity and Knowledge Collapse in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation</description>

      <title>Compass: General Filtered Search across Vector and Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates efficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector search with complex relational filtering. However, existing filtered search solutions are fundamentally limited by specialized indices, which restrict arbitrary filtering and hinder integration with general-purpose DBMSs. This work introduces \textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general filtered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index designs. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF for vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a principled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate generation and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass maintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and range predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or multi-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Compass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general framework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query throughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings with only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality and DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution for achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.</description>

      <title>The Value of Personalized Recommendations: Evidence from Netflix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</description>
