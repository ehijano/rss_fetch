      <title>A Quick Note On Homsets and Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homset invariant of a knot or link L with respect to an algebraic knot coloring structure X can be identified with a set of colorings of a diagram of L by elements of X via an identification of diagrammatic generators with algebraic generators. In some cases, particularly when either L or X has a high degree of symmetry, distinct homset elements can be represented by superficially similar X-colored diagrams, potentially leading to confusion. In this short note we examine and attempt to clarify this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>New Polynomial Decategorifications of the Quandle Coloring Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two new families of polynomial invariants of oriented classical and virtual knots and links defined as decategorfications of the quandle coloring quiver. We provide examples to illustrate the computation of the invariants, show that they are not determined by the quandle counting invariant, and compute tables of invariants values for some small quandles.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to circle packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a finite simplicial complex triangulating a disc, its Euclidean circle packings can be found by solving a system of polynomial equations. We also present a similar system of equations for unbranched circle packings. The variables in these equations are associated to corners of triangles in the complex, with one equation for each interior vertex, interior edge, and face. The vertex equations are generalisations of the Descartes circle theorem, of higher degree but more symmetric than those previously found by the authors. We also provide some connections between the spinorial approach of previous work of the authors, and classical Euclidean geometry.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Veech Measures of Convex Flat Cone Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Siegel gives the average number of lattice points in bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Motivated by this result, Veech introduced an analogue for translation surfaces, known as the Siegel-Veech formula, which describes the average number of saddle connections of bounded length on the moduli space of translation surfaces. However, no such formula is known for flat surfaces with cone angles that are irrational multiples of $\pi$.
  A convex flat cone sphere is a Riemann sphere equipped with a conformal flat metric with conical singularities, all of whose cone angles lie in the interval $(0, 2\pi)$. In this paper, we extend the Siegel-Veech formula to this setting. We define a generalized Siegel-Veech transform and prove that it belongs to $L^\infty$ on the moduli space. This leads to the definition of a Siegel-Veech measure on $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, obtained by integrating the Siegel-Veech transform over the moduli space. This measure can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Siegel-Veech formula. We show that it is absolutely continuous and piecewise real analytic.
  Finally, we study the asymptotic behavior of this measure on small intervals $(0,\varepsilon)$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, providing an analogue of Siegel-Veech constants for convex flat cone spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note, we discuss normal generators for mapping class groups of surfaces. Especially, we focus on the relation between normal generation of a mapping class with its asymptotic translation lengths on the Teichm\"uller space and the curve graph of the underlying surface. We also discuss several open questions.</description>

      <title>Region colorings of surfaces in 4-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niebrzydowski introduced a theory of region colorings for surface links. In this paper, we translate the coloring invariant to the context of triplane diagrams and movies of knots. We provide inequalities between the number of region colorings and topological quantities of $F$, such as the number of saddles in a movie and the bridge index of a triplane diagram of $F$. As an application, we show that Yoshikawa's 2-knots $9_1$ and $10_2$ are non-invertible; that is $F\not=-F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the topological results of Lytchak-Nagano and Lytchak-Nagano-Stadler for CAT(0) spaces to the setting of Busemann spaces of nonpositive curvature, i.e., BNPC spaces. We give a characterization of locally BNPC topological manifolds in terms of their links and show that the singular set of a locally BNPC homology manifold is discrete. We also prove that any (globally) BNPC topological 4-manifold is homeomorphic to Euclidean space. Applications include a topological stability theorem for locally BNPC G-spaces. Our arguments also apply to spaces admitting convex geodesic bicombings.</description>

      <title>Hopf-type theorems for convex surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study variations of the Hopf theorem concerning continuous maps $f$ of a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We investigate the case when $M$ is a closed convex $n$-dimensional surface and prove that the Hopf theorem (as well its quantitative generalization) is still valid but with the replacement of geodesic to quasigeodesic in the sense of Alexandrov (and Petrunin). Besides, we study a discrete version of the Hopf theorem. We say that a pair of points $a$ and $b$ are $f$-neighbors if $f(a) = f(b)$. We prove that if $(P,d)$ is a triangulation of a convex polyhedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with a metric $d$, compatable with topology of $P$, and $f \colon P \to \mathbb{R}^2$ is a simplicial map of general position, then there exists a polygonal path in the space of $f$-neighbors that connects a pair of `antipodal' points with a pair of identical points. Finally, we prove that the set of $f$-neighbors realizing a given distance $\delta &gt; 0$ (in a specific interval), has non-trivial first Steenrod homology with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will define and study some generalisations of pure $\mathfrak{g}$-braid groups that occur in the theory of connections on curves, for any complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. They make up local pieces of the wild mapping class groups, which are fundamental groups of (universal) deformations of wild Riemann surfaces, underlying the braiding of Stokes data and generalising the usual mapping class groups. We will establish a general product decomposition for the local wild mapping class groups, and in many cases define a fission tree controlling this decomposition. Further in type A we will show one obtains cabled versions of braid groups, related to braid operads.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to the Hausdorff Measure and Its Applications in Fractal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the Hausdorff measure, a fundamental tool in fractal geometry and geometric measure theory. We begin by defining the Hausdorff outer measure on subsets of metric spaces, followed by a discussion of Caratheodory's criterion, which characterizes measurable sets. From this foundation, we construct the Hausdorff measure and explore its essential properties, including monotonicity and translation invariance. We then introduce the Hausdorff dimension, a powerful generalization of Euclidean dimension, particularly suited to analyzing non-regular or self-similar sets. As an application, we examine the Cantor ternary set, computing its Hausdorff dimension and demonstrating how the Hausdorff measure captures its geometric complexity. This exposition aims to bridge the gap between abstract theory and illustrative application, offering insights relevant to mathematics and various scientific domains such as physics and computer science.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical hyperbolicity of admissible curve graphs and the boundary of marked strata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for any surface of genus at least 3 equipped with any choice of framing, the graph of non-separating curves with winding number 0 with respect to the framing is hierarchically hyperbolic but not Gromov hyperbolic. We also describe how to build analogues of the curve graph for marked strata of abelian differentials that capture the combinatorics of their boundaries, analogous to how the curve graph captures the combinatorics of the augmented Teichmueller space. These curve graph analogues are also shown to be hierarchically, but not Gromov, hyperbolic.</description>

Abstract: We consider the (universal) local isomonodromic deformations of irregular-singular connections defined on principal bundles over complex curves: for any (connected) complex reductive structure group G and any pole order, allowing for twisted/ramified formal normal forms at each pole and for twists in the interior of the curve. This covers the general case, and we particularly study the fundamental groups of the spaces of admissible deformations of irregular types/classes, in the viewpoint of (twisted/nonsplit) reflections cosets.</description>

      <title>Generalized Legendrian racks: Classification, tensors, and knot coloring invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Legendrian racks are nonassociative algebraic structures based on the Legendrian Reidemeister moves. We study algebraic aspects of GL-racks and coloring invariants of Legendrian links.
  We answer an open question characterizing the group of GL-structures on a given rack. As applications, we classify several infinite families of GL-racks. We also compute automorphism groups of dihedral GL-quandles and the categorical center of GL-racks.
  Then we construct an equivalence of categories between racks and GL-quandles.
  We also study tensor products of racks and GL-racks coming from universal algebra. Surprisingly, the categories of racks and GL-racks have tensor units. The induced symmetric monoidal structure on medial racks is closed, and similarly for medial GL-racks.
  Answering another open question, we use GL-racks to distinguish Legendrian knots whose classical invariants are identical. In particular, we complete the classification of Legendrian $8_{13}$ knots.
  Finally, we use exhaustive search algorithms to classify GL-racks up to order 8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study exact Lagrangian cobordisms between exact Lagrangians in a cotangent bundle in the sense of Arnol'd, using microlocal theory of sheaves. We construct a sheaf quantization for an exact Lagrangian cobordism between Lagrangians with conical ends, prove an iterated cone decomposition of the sheaf quantization for cobordisms with multiple ends, and show that the interleaving distance of sheaves is bounded by the shadow distance of the cobordism. Using the result, we prove a rigidity result on Lagrangian intersection by estimating the energy cost of splitting and connecting Lagrangians through cobordisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study generating series encoding linking numbers between geodesics in arithmetic hyperbolic $3$-folds. We show that the series converge to functions on genus $2$ Siegel space and that certain explicit modifications have the transformation properties of genus $2$ Siegel modular forms of weight $2$. This is done by carefully analyzing the integral of the Kudla--Millson theta series over a Seifert surface with geodesic boundary. As a corollary, we deduce a polynomial bound on the linking numbers.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for topological groups: A case study on countable Stone spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By analogy with the Cayley graph of a group with respect to a finite generating set or the Cayley--Abels graph of a totally disconnected, locally compact group, we detail countable connected graphs associated to Polish groups that we term Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graphs. A group admitting a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph acts on it continuously, coarsely metrically properly and cocompactly by isometries of the path metric. By an expansion of the Milnor--Schwarz lemma, it follows that the group is generated by a coarsely bounded set and the group equipped with a word metric with respect to a coarsely bounded generating set and the graph are quasi-isometric. In other words, groups admitting Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graphs are topological analogues of finitely generated groups. Our goal is to introduce this topological perspective on the work of Rosendal to a geometric group theorist.
  We apply these concepts to homeomorphism groups of countable Stone spaces. We completely characterize when these homeomorphism groups are coarsely bounded, when they are locally bounded (all of them are), and when they admit a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph, and if so produce a coarsely bounded generating set.</description>
