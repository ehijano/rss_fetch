      <title>Bremsstrahlung Gamma Ray as a Probe of Short-Range Correlations in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleons in nuclei form temporally correlated pairs in close proximity, called short range correlation (SRC), which plays a crucial role in understanding nuclear structure and the fundamental properties of dense nuclear matter. The consequence of SRC on heavy-ion collisions (HICs) has remained unexplored until now. In this paper, we identify neutron-proton bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray emission from HICs as a new indicator of SRC in nuclei. By observing the hardening of the bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray spectrum, which results from the increase of high-momentum components above the Fermi surface in nucleon momentum distributions, we precisely determine the SRC fraction in nuclei to be $(21\pm7)\%$ at $3\sigma$ confidence levels. Our experiment identifies the first direct and accurate signature of SRC in low-energy HICs, providing a new method to study the parton momentum distribution of nucleons in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the CUPID experiment to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CUPID is a next-generation bolometric experiment to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) of $^{100}$Mo using Li$_2$MoO$_4$ scintillating crystals. It will operate 1596 crystals at $\sim$10 mK in the CUORE cryostat at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. Each crystal will be facing two Ge-based bolometric light detectors for $\alpha$ rejection. We compute the discovery and the exclusion sensitivity of CUPID to $0\nu\beta\beta$ in a Frequentist and a Bayesian framework. This computation is done numerically based on pseudo-experiments. For the CUPID baseline scenario, with a background and an energy resolution of $1.0 \times 10^{-4}$ counts/keV/kg/yr and 5 keV FWHM at the Q-value, respectively, this results in a Bayesian exclusion sensitivity (90% c.i.) of $\hat{T}_{1/2} &gt; 1.6^{+0.6}_{-0.5} \times 10^{27} \ \mathrm{yr}$, corresponding to the effective Majorana neutrino mass of $\hat{m}_{\beta\beta} &lt; \ 9.6$ -- $16.3 \ \mathrm{meV}$. The Frequentist discovery sensitivity (3$\sigma$) is $\hat{T}_{1/2}= 1.0 \times 10^{27} \ \mathrm{yr}$, corresponding to $\hat{m}_{\beta\beta}= \ 12.2$ -- $20.6 \ \mathrm{meV}$.</description>

      <title>Two-proton correlations in the decay of 48Ni and 45Fe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main observables of the rare two-proton emission process - half-life, total energy of the decay as well as energy and angular correlations between the emitted protons - have been measured for 48Ni and 45Fe in a recent experiment performed at the GANIL/LISE3 facility. The results, together with previous experimental work, are compared for the first time with calculations performed in the recently developed Gamow Coupled-Channel (GCC) framework and to 3-body predictions from literature. The comparison of the 48Ni and the 45Fe two-proton angular distributions with the GCC calculations confirms the adopted strength of the proton-proton interaction for both nuclei and the predominant small-angle emission. A comparison with 3-body model angular distributions indicates the shell closure of the f_7/2 orbital for 48Ni and a substantial occupancy of the p-orbital for 45Fe. Discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical predictions are found when studying the other observables: half-lives, total energy of the decay and energy correlations, showing the complexity of the description of the two-proton emission process.</description>

      <title>Rapidity scan with DCCI at LHC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI2) model to include the baryon number evolution in the entire system created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Introducing the source term for the baryon number, we describe the early-stage equilibration and later-stage hydrodynamic evolution of the baryon number throughout the system from midrapidity to forward rapidity. Through numerical simulations with this extended model, we show that extremely large baryon chemical potentials are realized in forward rapidity regions at the LHC energy and are comparable to those of the BES energies. Moreover, we show that fluctuations of baryon chemical potentials are large and, consequently, negative baryon chemical potential regions appear at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>An effective finite-range Gogny-type interaction for the quantum molecular dynamics like model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an effective finite-range Gogny-type interaction that can be directly used in the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) like model. Two methods for determining the parameters of the effective interaction are discussed. The first method establishes an approach to connect the conventional Gogny interaction in nuclear structure to that in heavy-ion collisions, the second method allows for the description of the symmetry energy varying from the supersoft to stiff, as well as the momentum-dependent symmetry potential, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic to non-monotonic variations. This effective interaction opens up opportunities for a deeper understanding of finite-range interactions and non-monotonic momentum-dependent symmetry potentials in future studies.</description>

      <title>The quest for the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of dynamical models of relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of heavy-ion collisions is one of the most exciting and challenging directions of science for the last four decades. On the theoretical side one deals with a non-abelian field theory, while on the experimental side today's largest accelerators are needed to enable these studies. The discovery of a new stage of matter - called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - and the study of its properties is one of the major achievements of modern physics. In this contribution we briefly review the history of theoretical descriptions of heavy-ion collisions based on dynamical models, focusing on the personal experiences in this inspiring field.</description>

      <title>A Novel FFA-Based Storage Ring Design with an Internal Target for Heavy-Ion Beams Undergoing Stochastic Charge State Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A heavy-ion storage ring with an energy recovery internal target(ERIT) is suitable for rare production reactions. The most onerous obstacle to the stable operation of this ring is a phenomenon of stochastic charge state conversions(SCSC) of the ions in the beam caused by the collision with the target. This phenomenon causes a rapid increase in the beam emittance. To solve this problem, we have developed a method to match the closed orbits and beta functions of the beams in different charge states at the production target location in the scaling FFA ring. In this paper, we show through 6D beam tracking simulations that the FFA ring with modulated $k$ suppresses the emittance growth even in the presence of SCSC, and it can accumulate the beam over 600 turns effectively.</description>

      <title>Optimizations of electronic stopping cross section measurements using the backscattering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is essential for advancing nuclear science and materials research. In this work, we present an optimized methodology for stopping power measurements using the backscattering technique, with a focus on minimizing both random and systematic uncertainties. By systematically analyzing the sources of uncertainty and refining the experimental geometry, we establish a robust framework for high-precision measurements. Our approach was applied to the stopping power of helium ions in gold thin films, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference models such as SRIM and ICRU-49. The results reveal that carefully chosen measurement angles can effectively balance statistical precision and systematic accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3% across a wide energy range. This study provides a refined strategy for stopping power determination, offering valuable improvements for ion beam analysis and benchmarking theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Electronic stopping cross sections of tungsten to swift ions and comparisons with models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate stopping power data for tungsten is crucial for ion beam analysis (IBA) techniques applied to fusion-related materials. In this work, we present new experimental measurements of the stopping power of tungsten for protons and alpha particles, addressing key gaps in fundamental databases. Our results provide a densely spaced dataset, refining the practical uncertainty limits to approximately 1.5\% for protons and 4\% for alpha particles. We critically compare our findings with semi-empirical and theoretical models, evaluating their performance in describing the stopping power of tungsten for light projectiles. By improving the accuracy and reliability of stopping power data, we contribute to the enhancement of the applicability of ion-beam methods for characterizing tungsten in fusion-related research. These findings contribute to the refinement of semi-empirical models and support the ongoing efforts to develop more precise theoretical frameworks for ion-solid interactions in high-Z materials.</description>

      <title>Probing the octupole deformation of $^{238}$U in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some atomic nuclei exhibit ``pear" shapes arising from octupole deformation ($\beta_3$), though direct experimental evidences for such exotic shapes remains scarce. Low-energy model studies suggest $^{238}$U may have a modest octupole deformation arising from collective vibrational degrees of freedom, in addition to a large prolate shape. We investigated the impact of this modest octupole shape on observables involving triangular flow ($v_3$) in high-energy nuclear collisions. Using a hydrodynamic framework, we show $v_3$ and its correlation with mean transverse momentum, $\langle v_3^2 \delta\pT \rangle$, exhibit strong sensitivity to $\beta_3$. We found that $\langle v_3^2\rangle$ follows a linear increase with $\beta_3^2$, while $\langle v_3^2 \delta\pT \rangle$ is suppressed in the presence of $\beta_3$. Our findings show that the collective-flow-assisted nuclear imaging method in high-energy nuclear collisions, when compared with experimental data, can provide unique constraints on higher-order deformations.</description>

      <title>Correlation studies of the $^{7}$He excited states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unbound nucleus $^{7}$He was recently studied in the $^2$H($^{6}$He,$^1$H)$^{7}$He reaction at 29 $A\,$MeV beam energy in Ref.[M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)]. The excitation spectrum of $^{7}$He was measured up to $E_T=8$ MeV ($E_T$ is energy above the $^{6}$He-$n$ threshold). Angular distribution for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay of the $^{7}$He $3/2^-$ ground state can be explained by a strong spin alignment induced by a reaction mechanism. The correlation information for the higher-lying $^{7}$He excitations is available as backward-forward asymmetry for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay in the $^{7}$He frame. The asymmetry function has an expressed energy profile which may be explained by using quite restrictive assumptions about structure of $^{7}$He excitations or/and peculiarities of the reaction mechanism. In the analysis of [M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)] the observation the $s_{1/2}$ state in $^{7}$He is declared with $E_r \approx 2.0$ MeV. Our work is based on the same $^{7}$He data. However, the data analysis was improved and also the data interpretation is substantiated with the detailed PWBA reaction studies and coupled-channel calculations of the $^{7}$He continuous spectrum. The idea of the $s_{1/2}$ resonant state with $E_r \approx 2.0$ is rejected. In addition, the position of the $1/2^-$ state in $^{7}$He is confined to the interval $E_r=2.2-3.0$ MeV, with ``preferred'' value 2.6 MeV. There is indication on the second $3/2^-$ state in the data with $E_r \sim 4.5$ MeV and with the lower resonance energy limit $E_r \gtrsim 3.5$ MeV. Importance and prospects of more detailed correlation studies of $^{7}$He continuum are discussed.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons (pions). In this paper, we consider that pions are in thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order viscous hydrodynamics for a medium of massive pions to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number $Kn&gt;1$ limit. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields are preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with the natural decay widths of the resonances. The resonances can play an essential role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ yield ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We calculate these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare the findings with experimental data. Our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental data, indicating a possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

Abstract: Background: The halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) provides a very efficient description of loosely-bound nuclei in models of reaction. It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-powered data cleaning for LEGEND: a semi-supervised approach using affinity propagation and support vector machines</title>

Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare nuclear process that, if observed, will provide insight into the nature of neutrinos and help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay (LEGEND) will operate in two phases to search for $0\nu\beta\beta$. The first (second) stage will employ 200 (1000) kg of High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) enriched in $^{76}$Ge to achieve a half-life sensitivity of 10$^{27}$ (10$^{28}$) years. In this study, we present a semi-supervised data-driven approach to remove non-physical events captured by HPGe detectors powered by a novel artificial intelligence model. We utilize Affinity Propagation to cluster waveform signals based on their shape and a Support Vector Machine to classify them into different categories. We train, optimize, test our model on data taken from a natural abundance HPGe detector installed in the Full Chain Test experimental stand at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We demonstrate that our model yields a maximum sacrifice of physics events of $0.024 ^{+0.004}_{-0.003} \%$. Our model is being used to accelerate data cleaning development for LEGEND-200 and will serve to improve data cleaning procedures for LEGEND-1000.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross sections and stiffness of dense nuclear matter from Bayesian analyses of FOPI proton flow excitation functions</title>

Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions with momentum-independent Skyrme interactions, we infer from the proton directed and elliptical flow in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies from 150 to 1200 MeV/nucleon taken by the FOPI Collaboration the posterior Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section (BBSCS) modification factor $X$ (with respect to their free-space values) and the stiffness parameter $K$ of dense nuclear matter. We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>
