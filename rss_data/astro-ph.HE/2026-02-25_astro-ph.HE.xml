      <title>High Resolution VLA Radio Observations of the Boomerang Pulsar Wind Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a radio polarimetric study of the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula G106.65+2.96 with VLA observations at the 6 GHz band. Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\sim$50-105$\mu$G.</description>

      <title>The origin of isolated millisecond pulsars in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are observed as isolated objects, despite the widely accepted scenario in which MSPs are formed through recycling in compact binary systems. The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $\Lambda \propto n a/(\sigma a_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $\sigma$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie--Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\mathcal{F}_i \propto\Lambda \propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $\omega$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs.</description>

      <title>Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess from a Generic Triaxial Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Strong Alfv\'enic MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfv\'en waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfv\'en waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfv\'en wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfv\'en waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfv\'en waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfv\'en waves is still important.</description>

      <title>Search for Light-Mass Fractionally Charged Particles in Space with DAMPE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCPs) are predicted by some theories beyond or extended to the standard model. FCPs have been widely searched for by underground and space-based experiments based on the assumption of heavy lepton-like particles. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on light-mass FCPs (LFCPs) in the sub-MeV mass range. In this work, we report the LFCPs in primary high energy cosmic rays, based on observational data from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite. This study utilized ten years on-orbit data of DAMPE to search for LFCPs with a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$. No LFCP candidate was observed. Upper flux limit of LFCPs with a mass of 0.511 MeV$/c^{2}$ and a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$ is determined to be $\rm 5.0 \times 10^{-11}\,cm^{-2}sr^{-1}s^{-1}$ at the $\rm 90\%$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>ASKAP J005512.2-255834: A Luminous, Long-Lived Radio Transient at z = 0.1 -- an Orphan Afterglow or an off-nuclear TDE from an IMBH?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a slowly evolving, extragalactic radio transient, ASKAP J005512.2--255834 (hereafter ASKAP J0055-2558), identified using the Australian SKA Pathfinder in a search for orphan afterglows associated with archival gravitational wave events. Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $&lt;250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $\nu L_\nu \sim 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date.</description>

      <title>AT 2024wpp: the most luminous fast-evolving optical transient linked to the merger explosion of a black-hole binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20523v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. Their physical origins remain highly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from stellar explosion to tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we report observations of the most luminous FBOT, AT 2024wpp whose post-peak luminosity rebrightens in X ray and becomes flattening in optical in a manner follows the decay rate characteristic of TDEs ($L_{\rm bol} \propto t^{-5/3}$). This invokes energy contribution of accretion by a central compact object, getting further corroborations from hardening of X-ray spectral index and detection of outflow inferred from the emission lines at similar phase. Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a non-equipartition energy regime in 1803+784 Core-shift and Faraday rotation measurements from simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric VGOS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Compact jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly assumed to be in equipartition between particle and magnetic-field energy densities at the regions where the radio emission dominates at centimetre wavelengths. This assumption has significant implications for both jet physics and the accuracy of VLBI-based astrometry and geodesy.
  Aims. We tested the validity of the energy equipartition hypothesis in AGN cores at centimetre wavelengths by analysing the blazar 1803+784 using simultaneous broadband full-polarization observations with the VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS).
  Methods. We present VGOS observations of the blazar 1803+784 covering the 3-11 GHz frequency range. The data were processed using a dedicated calibration pipeline, followed by model fitting and multi-frequency imaging analysis. We measured the frequency-dependent core shift and mapped the spectral index and rotation measure (RM) across the source.
  Results. We find a core-shift power-law index of $k_r = 0.73^{+0.12}_{-0.19}$, significantly deviating from the expected equipartition value of $k_r = 1$. This indicates that either the equipartition condition or the conical jet geometry, or both, are not fulfilled in the centimetre-wavelength core region. The wide frequency coverage of VGOS also allows us to decouple the Faraday rotation of the core into an internal component (${\rm RM}_I = 121 \pm 8$ rad m$^{-2}$, produced in the core region) and an external component (${\rm RM}_E = -44 \pm 9$ rad m$^{-2}$, associated with a distant, extended medium that may also affect the polarization in downstream regions of the jet at larger scales).
  Conclusions. These results demonstrate the power of VGOS for high-fidelity simultaneous multi-frequency polarimetric studies of compact AGN jets, and underline the need to account for non-equipartition effects in both jet astrophysics and geodetic VLBI.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Discoveries from the TRAPUM UHF Survey of Fermi-LAT Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) provides advantages for radio pulsar searches by enabling efficient target selection. We can confidently point radio telescopes to the positions of Fermi unidentified gamma-ray sources that have a high probability of hosting a pulsar. As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Geminga halo at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby pulsars within $\sim1\,{\rm kpc}$ are considered to be possible sources of 10-500 GeV cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. A TeV halo around Geminga is detected by HAWC, and the measurements of its surface brightness profile indicate a slow particle diffusion surrounding the source. This result challenges the pulsar interpretation of the positron excess. The observations at GeV energies provide direct information on the electron/positron density in the GeV nebula, which can offer more direct constraints on the origin of the positron excess. Two previous works have performed analyses on the GeV emission of the pulsar halo, but focused on the energy band above 8 GeV. In this work, we use a longer dataset from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to re-analyze the GeV halo emission of Geminga, extending the analysis to cover the energy range of 1-1000 GeV. We find that the analysis in this wider energy range results in a low significance of the halo emission. This can be attributed to the Galactic interstellar emission model being unable to perfectly fit the background over this broader energy range, and due to the low measured halo flux at $&lt;$ 10 GeV energies leading to a mismatch between the observation and model expectation. We also derive the spectral energy distribution of the tentative halo emission, which shows a very hard spectrum in the 1-10 GeV range.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Filling in MAD Simulations and its Impact on the Jet in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically arrested accretion disks (MADs) in black hole jet launching simulations are very successful in modelling low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) like M87*. The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well.</description>

      <title>XRISM Discovery of Multiple Ionized Fe-K Emission and Absorption Components in Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first clear detection of ionized Fe-K emission and absorption components in the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A, revealed by the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve detector. In the 6.5-6.9 keV band, XRISM reveals multiple Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission components. One is a broad (with a width of sigma = 3000 km/s) and redshifted (+3400 km/s) component, originating at D = 0.02 pc from the central black hole. The other two components are narrow (with a width of sigma = 500 km/s) and exhibit redshifted and blueshifted velocities (+2600 km/s and -1500 km/s), originating from more distant regions (D = 0.1 pc). The photo-ionized model explains the broader component, while the two narrower components can be explained by either photo-ionization or collisional ionization. One interpretation is that the broader component is an outflow at ~10^2 R_S (R_S; Schwarzschild radius) and the narrow component is a shock-heated plasma close to the torus, with a possible connection to the JWST-discovered outflow outside the torus. Two blueshifted absorption lines are detected at ~7.1 keV (~10^4 km/s) and ~10.6 keV (~10^5 km/s). The line significance of the 10.6 keV line is above 98%. The absorption line components might be attributed to the broad emission component. These results demonstrate the high potential of XRISM/Resolve to characterize ionized emission and absorption features in the Fe-K band. Our findings establish a new benchmark in the study of circumnuclear environments in low-luminosity radio galaxies, thereby contributing to a broader understanding of AGN unification.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation for 2-particle species gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. We consider a locally electrically neutral system composed of two particle species with opposite charges, with vanishing dipole moment or spin, so that the fluid has vanishing magnetization and polarization. We find that the dynamics of this fluid changes dramatically in the presence of a magnetic field. The shear stress tensor no longer adheres to a single differential equation; instead, it splits into three non-degenerate components, each evolving according to distinct dynamical equations. Exploring these equations in a Bjorken flow scenario, we find that for large magnetic fields, our theory predicts oscillatory behavior beyond the scope of an Israel-Stewart-like theory.</description>

      <title>Turbulent AGN coronae as the origin of diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the turbulence acceleration in AGN coronae can account for 1-10 TeV neutrinos from some AGNs, such as the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Based on this, there are attempts to explain the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube with the accumulated contribution from a population of AGNs, but it is found that the maximum neutrino energy is less than tens of TeV and, as a result, additional source classes are needed to explain the high-energy component above this energy. Recently, motivated by the detection of &gt;100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, it was shown that the turbulence acceleration in the corona can explain &gt;100 TeV neutrinos given a larger magnetization parameter ($\sigma\sim 1$) in the corona, which leads to a larger maximum proton energy and a hard proton spectrum. In this paper, we extend this assumption to the population of AGNs and study whether the population of AGNs with a wide range of magnetization can explain the entire diffuse neutrinos. We find that AGN coronae could account for the diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies if a significant fraction of AGNs have magnetization as large as $\sigma\sim 1-10$. This conclusion is insensitive to the shape of the magnetization parameter distribution as long as the range of the magnetization parameter is sufficiently wide and the distribution is flat towards high magnetization. Interestingly, this model can also explain the peak of the diffuse neutrino spectrum at 30 TeV.</description>

      <title>Black hole-Neutron star distinction based on long-term MAXI and Swift study of 42 low mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analysed about $\sim$13 years of publicly available data from MAXI and Swift/BAT to examine the long-term source evolution of 42 transient low-mass X-ray binaries. The sample consists of 11 confirmed black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), 10 black hole candidates (BHC), and 21 neutron star X-ray binaries (NSXBs). Outbursts and flaring activities studied over 13 years show that 19/21 NSXBs spend significantly longer time in the hard state (observations for which hardness ratio is $\geq$ 0.2) while 15/21 BHXB+XRC spend substantially longer time in the soft state (observations for which hardness ratio is $&lt;$ 0.2). The frequency distribution of the hardness ratio clearly shows two distinct distributions for BHXBs and NSXBs, with their peaks separated: NSXBs prefer harder values, while BHXBs prefer softer values of hardness. Our model-independent analysis for 42 transient sources shows that statistically NSXBs do not prefer to show a canonical high soft state as observed in BHXBs. Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($&gt;$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB.</description>

      <title>Molecular bipolar outflow in SN 1987A supports the jittering-jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I examine high-quality CO and SiO molecular maps of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SN 1987A from the literature and find that the molecular gas exhibits a bipolar structure, correlated with the visible bipolar morphology (termed the keyhole) and the bipolar morphology of the iron emission map. The keyhole has a morphology similar to that of many jet-shaped pairs of bubbles in cooling-flow clusters of galaxies and planetary nebulae. Therefore, the findings of this study, which make the bipolar structure of SN 1987A robust, strengthen the claim that a pair of energetic jets shaped the keyhole and its surroundings. According to the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM), this pair of jets was the most energetic of several pairs that exploded SN 1987A. This study adds to the accumulating evidence that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe, responsible for the majority, or even all, CCSNe.</description>

      <title>The no-hair theorems at work in the tidal disruption event AT2020afhd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the coprecession of both the accretion disk and the jet formed following the tidal disruption event associated with the optical transient AT2020afhd, driven by a supermassive black hole of almost ten million solar masses, were independently measured in both the X and radio bands, respectively, showing a periodicity of nearly 20 days over about 300 days. An analytical model of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring precession of the effective orbit of a fictitious test particle revolving about a spinning primary can explain the observed precessional features. It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted.</description>

      <title>RAMSES-MCR: A consistent multi-group treatment of cosmic rays physics in momentum-space with the RAMSES code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are known to play a key role in many astrophysical environments: they can modify shock dynamics, influence the thermochemistry and the ionization of the interstellar medium, regulate galaxy mass content by driving galactic winds, and be released by jets from active galactic nuclei. They also serve as important observational tracers through $\gamma$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase.</description>

      <title>Warm dark matter from freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study warm Higgs portal dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. This scenario assumes that the Standard Model thermal bath temperature has always been relatively low, which suppresses dark matter production. As a result, a significant DM-Higgs coupling is allowed, enabling warm dark matter detection via Higgs decay at colliders. We find that the Lyman-{\alpha} bound on the DM mass is particularly strong, excluding masses below 50-100 keV, depending on further details. The shape of the DM momentum distribution is highly non-thermal, with low momenta being effectively cut off, and not captured by the common {\alpha}{\beta}{\gamma}-parametrization.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous particle creation by oscillating compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory predicts that dynamical curved spacetimes can spontaneously excite particle pairs from the quantum vacuum, a phenomenon extensively studied in expanding universes and in scenarios involving gravitational collapse. In this article, we explore particle creation driven by radial oscillations of 3+1-dimensional spherically symmetric compact objects, such as neutron stars, using a massless, minimally coupled scalar field as a reference model. We employ a toy model to describe the oscillatory dynamics and its coupling to the field modes, focusing on the resulting effects in the exterior spacetime of the star. The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions. This allows us to determine the full particle spectrum and the total particle number in the strong-field and fully relativistic regime. Our analysis confirms the existence of particle creation in this setting and, crucially, reveals a distinct resonance structure in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A strongly hyperbolic viscous relativistic hydrodynamics theory with first-order charge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the first order dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics model of Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha- Kovtun (BDNK) in order to include the charge number current in full first order expansion with out-of-equilibrium contribution proportional to the evolution equation of the ideal fluid. We obtain a fully second order system of partial differential equation (PDE) that can be casted in a fully conservative way. We analyze the hyperbolicity of this model coupled to Einstein field equations using a newly developed technique that allows for hyperbolicity studies without explicit first order reduction. Furthermore, we identify a frame choice where our formulation is causal, stable and with positive entropy generation for a wide range of equations of state (EoS). Our analysis shows that the inclusion of an out-of-equilibrium correction to the charge current, plays an important role in guaranteeing the strong hyperbolicity and, therefore, the well-posedness of the system. If such correction is not applied, an extra frame restriction must be added to the present in the literature in order to obtain a strongly hyperbolic system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray scatterings on the cosmic neutrino background induce a flux of gamma-rays and X-rays from boosted meson decays and charged lepton processes. Here we present the first estimate of this flux and its cumulative cosmological contribution. Confronting expectations with Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray data, we find a limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity at the level of $\eta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_{\nu}\gtrsim0.1$ eV, orders of magnitude stronger than current direct laboratory probes, and comparable to constraints on the cosmic neutrino background obtained with IceCube. We further show that X-ray synchrotron emission from cascade electron-positron pairs in intergalactic magnetic fields provides a complementary, albeit weaker, constraint. We discuss how anisotropic signatures and future gamma-ray data from CTA could further improve bounds on the relic neutrino overdensity, approaching in sensitivity the $\Lambda$CDM expected density.</description>

      <title>Neural Bayesian updates to populations with growing gravitational-wave catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational-wave catalogs grow, they will become increasingly computationally expensive to analyze in their entirety, especially when inferring astrophysical source populations with high-dimensional, flexible models. Bayesian statistics offers a natural remedy, letting us update our knowledge of physical models as new data arrive, without re-analyzing existing data. However, doing so requires the posterior probability density of model parameters for previous observations, which is typically intractable. Here, we use variational neural posterior estimation to rapidly update the inferred population of binary black holes as data are observed in gravitational-wave detectors. We apply this approach to real and simulated catalogs analyzed with both low- and high-dimensional population models, testing the reliability of three update cadences: with new catalogs of sources, month by month during an observing run, and as each new signal arrives. We investigate the success and failure modes of neural sequential updates, finding that the robustness of updating is sensitive to the information contained in each update and that updating is most effective when performed with larger segments of data. We outline one additional scientific application enabled by Bayesian updating: identification of events that are individually informative about the population. Neural Bayesian updates to astrophysical population models also provide efficient likelihood representations for joint analyses with other data, e.g., standard-siren cosmology, and similar methods can be used to perform Bayesian stochastic background searches.</description>

      <title>BASS LVI. Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Formation of dusty clumps in the torus of active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The putative dusty torus is a key ingredient of the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei (AGN), but its origin remains a mystery. Here we put forward a new physical model to explain how a large number of small dusty gas clumps form and they collectively appear as a geometrically thick dynamic dusty torus. The circumnuclear hot gas flows towards the central black hole (BH) and forms a rotating disk on sub-pc scales. A fraction of inflowing hot gas condenses to form small cold clumps due to thermal instabilities, when the accretion rate is sufficiently high. These cold dusty gas clumps are irradiated by the central accretion disk and re-radiate as dust emission mostly in the infrared. We propose that the dusty torus in AGN consists of such cold clumps vertically supported by the radiation force against gravity. For clumps with suitable column density, the vertical component of the BH gravity is in quasi-static equilibrium with the infrared radiation force together with the vertical component of the disk radiation force. Our model is robust in the sense that for any reasonable range of parameters concerning clump vertical dynamical equilibrium a torus exists. We further show that the hot gas in the rotating flow condenses to cold clumps only if its accretion rate is higher than about one percent of the Eddington rate. The radiation force is unable to lift the cold gas clumps up away from the mid-plane when the luminosity of the disk surrounding the BH is lower than 0.1 percent of the Eddington luminosity. These two features of our model may provide a physical explanation for the lack of evidence of dusty tori in low-luminosity AGNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave radiation from periodic orbits in some standard regular black hole spacetimes is studied, primarily using known methods (numerical and analytic). We demonstrate specific differences with the singular Schwarzschild geometry by analysing orbit characteristics, gravitational wave strain profiles, and the corresponding power spectrum density, for different values of the regularising parameter `$g$'. Further, we assess our results vis-a-vis the LISA sensitivity curves and show how our results may be useful while developing templates for detecting regular black holes as viable alternatives to the singular ones. The appendices to our article contain details on errors in our estimates and provide for the first time, some exact analytical expressions on gravitational wave radiation from different types of periodic orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Long-term optical variability of high-mass X-ray binaries. III. Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Be/X-ray binaries are the most numerous group of high-mass X-ray binaries. Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abvb: a Type Ibn/Icn supernova with evidence of helium and an extreme offset from its host galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic and photometric observations and analysis of SN 2024abvb, a peculiar transitional Type Ibn/Icn supernova located at an unusually large projected distance from its host galaxy (21.5 kpc). SN 2024abvb displays an extended rise time in the $g$- and $o$-bands (10.1 and 10.6 days respectively), followed by a linear decline in all photometric bands. Comparisons with other supernova subclasses show that the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024abvb are distinct from Type~Ibn and Type Icn events, with a higher peak $r$-band luminosity and lower blackbody temperatures. Spectra reveal an initial blue continuum and narrow P-Cygni profiles, with C {\sc ii} $\lambda$5890 dominating in emission, persisting at late phases, and showing a rapid decline in the expansion velocity. Weak He {\sc i} $\lambda$5876 features are tentatively detected at early times. Analysis of progenitor scenarios rules out thermonuclear origins based on incompatible light curve shapes and spectral signatures. A rare massive star progenitor appears unlikely given the low local star formation rate. The most plausible origin is an ultra-stripped supernova scenario involving a binary system; this best explains the observed separation from the host, the low circumstellar material mass, the fast photometric evolution and the low nickel production, although a discrepancy in model versus observed ejecta mass remains. These results reinforce the classification of SN 2024abvb as a distinctive Type Ibn/Icn event and highlight the diversity of progenitor channels for interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of nearby starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 by combining high-resolution Far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat and archival Chandra X-ray observations. Using FUV flux measurements, we estimate a spatially-resolved star formation rate (SFR) across several star-forming clumps within a radius of $\sim$3.6 kpc, finding a total SFR of 0.022 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The H$_{\alpha}$ recombination line flux yields an SFR of $\sim$0.010 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the infrared-based SFR derived from 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ emission is significantly higher at 16 - 18 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that a substantial fraction of star formation in M 82 is heavily dust-obscured. Morphological comparison of FUV, H$_{\alpha}$, mid-infrared, and soft X-ray emission reveals a strong spatial correlation, tracing multi-phase outflows along the galaxy's minor axis. X-ray spectral analysis using a three-temperature $\texttt{VAPEC}$ model shows enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg, Si, and S, consistent with enrichment from Type-II supernovae. These results demonstrate the importance of combining UV, optical, IR, and X-ray observations to probe both obscured and unobscured star formation, the metal enrichment, and the outflow-driven evolution of starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dynamically-formed massive black holes in Little Red Dots from X-ray non-detections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21002v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density. Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.</description>

      <title>5PN eccentric waveforms for intermediate-mass-ratio-inspirals (IMRIs) from post-Newtonian and black hole perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves from compact binaries involving at least one intermediate mass black hole, and component mass ratios in the range $0.1$-$10^{-4}$, are among the primary sources for future space detectors with target strain sensitivities in the deci-Hertz (dHz) band. Tuned to the waveform requirements for analyzing such sources, a hybrid model is obtained by combining waveforms from the post-Newtonian (PN) and black hole perturbation (BHP) theory. Components of the binary are assumed to be nonspinning and on eccentric orbits. This hybrid model is 3PN accurate in terms of results from PN theory and 5PN in results from BHP theory. In terms of eccentricity, corrections through the order $\mathcal{O}(e^{10})$ are included. Further, using number of gravitational wave cycles estimates for a few representative binaries observable in the dHz band, we demonstrate the significance of the mass ratio information from the PN approach, of contributions from the BHP theory at high PN orders, and also of higher order eccentricity corrections. In particular, we find an almost 10-fold increase in number of gravitational wave cycles for a fixed mass ratio of 0.1 and $e_0\sim0.3$ (evaluated at $0.01$Hz) when contributions beyond the leading order in eccentricity are accounted for. We also confirm the requirement to go beyond 5PN order in the circular part of the waveform from BHP theory.</description>

Abstract: Given that gamma rays with energies larger than TeV are severely absorbed by background radiation fields, for many extragalactic sources, the GeV-TeV gamma-ray observations are the messengers that are closest in energy to the TeV-PeV neutrinos observed by IceCube. Investigating whether there is a correlation between the gamma-ray and neutrino observations can help us identify high-energy neutrino sources and determine which sources are the main contributors to the all-sky diffuse neutrino flux of IceCube. In previous work, we have already studied the possible gamma-neutrino correlations by analyzing 10 years of IceCube public muon-track data. In this work, we further investigate such correlations by employing the IceCube p-value sky map of the scan for point sources. We examine the spatial associations of hotspots in the neutrino sky map with various gamma-ray source samples: the third Fermi-LAT catalog of high-energy sources (3FHL), LAT 14-year source catalog (4FGL), the fourth catalog of active galactic nuclei (4LAC) and subsets of these samples. Among all the samples, the 3FHL sample shows a possible correlation with the neutrino hotspots with a pre-trial p-value of $9.0\times10^{-5}$ ($\sim 3.9\,\sigma$), corresponding to a post-trial significance of $\sim1.7\,\sigma$. However, this is found to be caused by three already known neutrino sources/source candidates: NGC 1068, TXS 0506+056, and PKS 1424+240.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Redshifts from Multiband of GRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this work, we use 88 time delays from GRBs ($0.117 &lt; z &lt; 6.29$), and provide a cosmological model-independent approach based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs to test LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1} \ge 1.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2} \ge 8.5\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (BLAGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines. We propose that a subset of these BLAGNs, the so-called "Little Blue Dots'' (LBDs) are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate photon scattering and shadowing within the polar funnel. Our models predict extremely-blue optical-UV continuum slopes and highly collimated radiation fields where isotropic-equivalent luminosities exceed the Eddington limit in the polar direction while shadowing suppresses emission at higher inclinations. This "searchlight" configuration naturally generates a stratified ionization structure: coronal and high-excitation narrow lines are produced along the symmetry axis, while the equatorial broad-line region (BLR) remains shielded from the hardest ionizing photons. We show that the anisotropic illumination of the BLR explains the observed faintness of high-ionization lines despite strong Balmer emission. For M_BH=10^7.5--10^8 Msun accretors at Eddington ratio ~10, standard BLR conditions predict HeII lambda 4686/Hbeta in the range 0.08--0.28. Notably, because inherently blue disk spectra provide a much higher ratio of ionizing to optical photons than standard quasar composites, the observed large Balmer equivalent widths are matched with typical BLR covering factors without invoking enshrouded geometries. Taken together, these findings support the view that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries, may naturally account for the ionizing SED and emission line diagnostics of high-z LBDs, while offering a plausible pathway to rapid black hole growth at cosmic dawn.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular clouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy, converts gas into stars less efficiently than anticipated. A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results. We demonstrate how, in the near future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer due to worldwide advancements in neutrino telescopes. Neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds. The neutrino production rate is proportional to the gas density without dependence on the complex properties of a cloud. Neutrinos also have the advantage of negligible absorption and unambiguous production channels, making it a method with the lowest systematic uncertainties. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades. Neutrinos from the CMZ will provide indications on the biases of traditional mass tracers and thus indirectly enhance the accuracy of gas measurements in far galaxies from which a neutrino signal is not detectable.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of relativistic shock breakout from a stellar wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Monte Carlo simulations of relativistic radiation-mediated shocks (RRMS) in the photon-starved regime, incorporating photon escape from the upstream region--characterized by the escape fraction, $f_{\rm esc}$--under a steady-state assumption. These simulations, performed for shock Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u = 2$, $3.5$, $6$, $10$, and $15$, are applicable to RRMS breakouts in shallowly declining density profiles such as stellar winds. We find that vigorous pair production acts as a thermostat, regulating the downstream temperature to $\sim 100$-$200~{\rm keV}$, largely independent of $f_{\rm esc}$. A subshock forms and strengthens with increasing $f_{\rm esc}$. The escaping spectra peak at $E_p \approx 300$-$600~{\rm keV}$ in the shock frame and deviate from a Wien distribution, exhibiting low-energy flattening ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{0}$) due to free-free emission and high-energy extensions caused by inverse Compton scattering from subshock-heated pairs. While an earlier analytical model reproduces the velocity structure well at $\Gamma_u = 2$, it significantly overestimates the shock width at higher Lorentz factors, particularly for $f_{\rm esc} \gtrsim$ a few $\%$. Based on this finding, we provide updated predictions for breakout observables in wind environments for $\Gamma_u \gtrsim 6$. Notably, the duration of the relativistic breakout becomes largely insensitive to the explosion energy and ejecta mass, typically exceeding analytical predictions by orders of magnitude and capable of producing a $\sim$300 s flash of MeV photons with a radiated energy of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg for an energetic explosion yielding $\Gamma_{bo} \sim 6$. We also discuss limitations of our modelling assumptions and their implications for the predicted breakout observables.</description>

      <title>Preferential Positron Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetized Electron-Positron-Ion Shocks</title>

Abstract: Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds. This study focuses on positron accelerations in magnetized relativistic shocks in electron-positron-ion plasma. Employing one-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulations, we found a preferential positron acceleration through an interaction with the wakefield associated with a precursor wave in the upstream region. Test particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood as the relativistic $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ acceleration formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting ultra-relativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the high-energy positron excess.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Direction Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays with Radio Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) observatories require unbiased direction reconstruction to enable multi-messenger astronomy with sparse, nanosecond-scale radio pulses. Explicit likelihood methods often rely on simplified models, which may bias results and understate uncertainties. We introduce a simulation-based inference pipeline that couples a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) to a normalizing-flow posterior within the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference framework. Each event is seeded by an analytic plane-wavefront fit; the GNN refines this estimate by learning spatiotemporal correlations among antenna signals, and its frozen embedding conditions an eight-block autoregressive flow that returns the full Bayesian posterior. Trained on about $8,000$ realistic UHECR air-shower simulations generated with the ZHAireS code, the posteriors are temperature-calibrated to meet empirical coverage targets. We demonstrate a sub-degree median angular resolution on test UHECR events, and find that the nominal 68% highest-posterior-density contours capture $71\% \pm 2\%$ of true arrival directions, indicating a mildly conservative uncertainty calibration. This approach provides physically interpretable reconstructions, well-calibrated uncertainties, and rapid inference, making it ideally suited for upcoming experiments targeting highly inclined events, such as GRAND, AugerPrime Radio, and BEACON.</description>

      <title>Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations and Observational Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within &lt;~300 rg.</description>

      <title>Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of long-rising type II supernovae -- Bayesian analytic modeling and spectrophotometric correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only 1-3 percent of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25762v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</description>

      <title>Properties and Possible Physical Origins of $\gamma$-ray Emission in Extreme Synchrotron Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme synchrotron blazars, characterized by a first peak in their broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at frequencies exceeding $10^{17}$ Hz, often exhibit a second peak beyond 1~TeV. These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\sigma$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs. Consistent with other GeV--TeV $\gamma$-ray-emitting BL Lacs, the jets in these EHBLs are marked by low radiation efficiency and low magnetization.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers. We apply this interacting fluid approach to the case of compact stars of neutron star matter with the Higgs portal fermionic dark matter model for the first time in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) H{\sc i} 21\,cm imaging of NGC\,4141, the host galaxy of FRB\,20250316A at $z=0.0063$. Our GMRT H{\sc i} 21\,cm images have spatial resolutions, at $z\approx0.0063$, of $\approx0.48-8.0$~kpc, and find evidence for (i)~a companion galaxy, LEDA\,2582852, to the south-west, (ii)~a nearby (27-kpc distant) H{\sc{i}} cloud to the south-west, (iii)~disturbances in the H{\sc{i}} distributions of both NGC\,4141 and LEDA\,2582852, and (iv)~high H{\sc{i}} column densities in the south-western outskirts of NGC\,4141. A Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum shows evidence for a low metallicity and a high star-formation rate (SFR) surface density activity in the south-western disk of NGC\,4141, while H$\alpha$-based SFR estimates over the last 10~Myr are higher than radio-based SFRs over the last 100~Myr. The above evidence indicates that NGC\,4141 has recently acquired metal-poor gas, via either a merger or accretion, that resulted in the south-western starburst and that may have also triggered large-scale star-formation activity in NGC\,4141, resulting in the formation of the stellar progenitor of FRB\,20250316A and the other transients. Our highest-resolution (480~pc) GMRT H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm image finds no H{\sc{i}} 21\,cm emission from the location of FRB\,20250316A or the nearby star-forming region, suggesting that most of the H{\sc{i}} here has been either ionized or converted into the molecular phase. Our non-detection of continuum emission at the location of FRB\,20250316A yields the $3\sigma$ upper limit $&lt;3.2\times10^{25}$~erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$, on the 1.4~GHz specific luminosity of a putative persistent radio source associated with FRB\,20250316A, one of the strongest constraints on the radio luminosity of such an associated persistent radio source.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed, spatially resolved { Veilleux \&amp; Osterbrock (VO) diagram} analysis of ESO\,137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O~III], [S~II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \textit{Chandra}. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H~II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim20$\,pc at $z=0.009$). To { visualize} the fine spatial structure of the { ISM excitation}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the { VO} diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. { SLI mapping reveals fine spatial structures in the ISM excitation especially in the Seyfert ionization bi-cones where the statistical significance of our data is higher.} Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with regions of the { VO} diagram that can be modeled with AGN photoionization. In the North-West Seyfert cone three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$\,yrs and $&lt;100$\,yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft X-ray emission at the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($&gt;1000$\,km\,s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The North-West cone is surrounded by a smooth LINER ``cocoon''. The LINER region in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.</description>

Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of double white dwarfs: evolutionary effects on system properties</title>

Abstract: Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are natural outcomes of binary stellar evolution and key sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the donor mass transfer rate and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.</description>

      <title>SMMAN: quasi-Simultaneous Multi-wavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope</title>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by strong temporal flux density variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, offering insights into the complex physical processes governing accretion and plasma outflows. To systematically investigate AGNs flux density variability in radio bands, a long-term program was initiated in late 2016: quasi-Simultaneous Multiwavelength Monitoring of gamma-ray-loud AGNs with the Nanshan 26-m radio telescope (SMMAN). This work presents the first data release of the SMMAN program, spanning over eight years from 2016 to 2024 with observations at 4.8 and 23.6 GHz. The SMMAN sample includes 131 northern ($\delta &gt;\sim0^{\circ}$) sources selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope third source catalog. The characteristics of variability, spectral index, luminosity, and $\gamma$-ray loudness factor are examined for different AGN classes within the sample. Target sources exhibit stronger variability at 23.6 GHz compared to 4.8 GHz, with BL Lac objects being more variable than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). BL Lacs generally have flatter radio spectra, while FSRQs, blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCUs), and radio galaxies (RDGs) span a wider range from flat to steep. FSRQs are more radio-luminous than BL Lacs and other classes, with BCUs intermediate and RDGs generally fainter. FSRQs and BL Lacs have higher $\gamma$-ray loudness factors than RDGs, while BCUs have intermediate values. The SMMAN dataset, incorporated with other historical and ongoing monitoring programs, will provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of spectral energy distributions, search for quasi-periodic oscillations, and analyze supermassive black hole binary systems.</description>
