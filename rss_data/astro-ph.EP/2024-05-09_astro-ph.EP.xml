      <title>The Detection of a Possible Exoplanet Orbiting KIC 1718360 Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the detection of a periodic dimming event in the lightcurve of the G1.5IV-V type star KIC 1718360. This is based on visible-light observations conducted by both the TESS and Kepler space telescopes. Analysis of the data points toward a possible orbiting body with a radius of approximately 1.048 Earth Radii with a period of 2.938 days, as well as a semi-major axis of 0.04 AU. The initial observation was made in Kepler Quarter 16 data using the One-Class SVM machine learning method. Subsequent observations by the TESS space telescope corroborate these findings. While still requiring further data to validate, these results may contribute to a growing body of data of Earthlike planets with short-period orbits.</description>

      <title>The Hot Jupiter Radius Anomaly and Stellar Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extremely close proximity of hot Jupiters to their parent stars has dramatically affected both their atmospheres and interiors, inflating them to up to twice the radius of Jupiter. The physical mechanism responsible for this inflation remains unknown, though many proposals have been put forward. I will review the known hot Jupiter population, the proposed inflation mechanisms, and the evidence for and against them collected thus far. In doing so, I will cover the ways that hot Jupiter interiors may be simulated computationally in detail, and present some useful formulas for estimating their radii, heating, intrinsic temperature, and tentative magnetic field strength. I will also cover the related issues of hot Jupiter intrinsic temperatures and radiative-convective boundaries, the potential connection with planetary magnetic fields, and the effects of stellar tides on the planet. Finally, I conclude with the suggestion that more than one mechanism may be operating in concert with each other and propose various avenues for future progress in understanding these objects.</description>

      <title>Convective overstability in radially global protoplanetary disks I - Pure gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are prone to several hydrodynamic instabilities. One candidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can drive radial semi-convection that may influence dust dynamics and planetesimal formation. However, the COS has primarily been studied in local models. This paper investigates the COS near the mid-plane of radially global disk models. We first conduct a global linear stability analysis, which shows that linear COS modes exist only radially inward of their Lindblad resonance (LR). The fastest-growing modes have LRs near the inner radial domain boundary with effective radial wavelengths that can be a substantial fraction of the disk radius. We then perform axisymmetric global simulations and find that the COS's nonlinear saturation is similar to previous incompressible shearing box simulations. In particular, we observe the onset of persistent zonal and elevator flows for sufficiently steep radial entropy gradients. In full 3D, non-axisymmetric global simulations, we find the COS produces large-scale, long-lived vortices, which induce outward radial transport of angular momentum via the excitation of spiral density waves. The corresponding $\alpha$-viscosity values of order $10^{-3}$ agree well with those found in previous 3D compressible shearing box simulations. However, in global disks, significant modifications to their radial structure are found, including the formation of pressure bumps. Interestingly, the COS typically generates an outward radial mass transport, i.e. decretion. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for planetesimal formation and for interpreting dust rings and asymmetries observed in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Abundances of Elements in Solar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between stars and planets provides important information for understanding the interior composition, mineralogy, and overall classification of small planets (R $\lesssim$ 3.5R$_{\oplus}$). Since stars and planets are formed at the same time and from the same material, their compositions are inextricably linked to one another, especially with respect refractory elements like Mg, Si, and Fe. As a result, stellar elemental abundances can help break the degeneracy inherent to planetary mass-radius models and determine whether planets may be similar to the Earth in composition or if additional factors, such as formation near the host star or a giant impact, may have influenced the planet's make-up. To this end, we now have observations of the abundances of extrasolar rocks that were pulled onto the surfaces of a white dwarfs, whose compositions act as a direct insight into the interiors of small exoplanets. From measurements of $\sim$30 of these "polluted" white dwarfs, we have found that composition of the extrasolar rocks are similar to Solar System chondritic meteorites.</description>

      <title>Resonant chains in triple-planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resonant chain may be formed in a multi-planetary system when ratios of the orbital periods can be expressed as ratios of small integers $T_1:T_2: \cdots :T_N=k_1: k_2: \cdots: k_N$. We investigate the dynamics and possible formation of resonant chain. The appropriate Hamiltonian for a three-planet resonant chain is defined and numerically averaged over the synodic period. The stable stationary solutions (apsidal corotational resonance, ACR) of this system, corresponding to the local extrema of Hamiltonian function, can be searched out numerically. The topology of the Hamiltonian around these ACRs reveals their stabilities. We further construct dynamical maps on representative planes to study the dynamics, and we calculate the deviation ($\chi^2$) of the resonant angle from the uniformly distributed values. Finally, the formation of resonant chain via convergent migration is simulated and stable configurations associated with ACRs are verified. We find that stable ACR families arising from circular orbits always exist for any resonant chain, and they may extend to high eccentricity. Around ACR solutions, regular motion are found in two types of resonant configurations. One is characterised by libration of both the two-body resonant angles and the three-body Laplace resonant angle, and the other by libration of only two-body resonant angles. The Laplace resonance seems not to contribute much to the stability. The resonant chain can be formed via convergent migration, and subsequently the resonant configuration evolves along the ACR families to eccentric orbits. Ideally, our methods introduced here can be applied to any resonant chain of any number of planets at any eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Carbon cycle instability for high-$\mathrm{CO_2}$ exoplanets: Implications for habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit in the definition of the classical circumstellar habitable zone (HZ) is the hypothesis that the carbonate-silicate cycle can maintain clement climates on exoplanets with land and surface water across a range of instellations by adjusting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ partial pressure ($p\mathrm{CO_2}$). This hypothesis is made by analogy to the Earth system, but it is an open question whether silicate weathering can stabilize climate on planets in the outer reaches of the HZ, where instellations are lower than those received by even the Archean Earth and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ is thought likely to dominate atmospheres. Since weathering products are carried from land to ocean by the action of water, silicate weathering is intimately coupled to the hydrologic cycle, which intensifies with hotter temperatures under Earth-like conditions. Here, we use global climate model (GCM) simulations to demonstrate that the hydrologic cycle responds counterintuitively to changes in climate on planets with $\mathrm{CO_2}$-$\mathrm{H_2O}$ atmospheres at low instellations and high $p\mathrm{CO_2}$, with global evaporation and precipitation decreasing as $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ and temperatures increase at a given instellation. Within the MAC weathering formulation, weathering then decreases with increasing $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ for a range of instellations and $p\mathrm{CO_2}$ typical of the outer reaches of the HZ, resulting in an unstable carbon cycle that may lead to either runaway $\mathrm{CO_2}$ accumulation or depletion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ to colder (possibly Snowball) conditions. While the behavior of the system has not been completely mapped out, the results suggest that silicate weathering could fail to maintain habitable conditions in the outer reaches of the nominal HZ.</description>

      <title>Numerical model of Phobos' motion incorporating the effects of free rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision ephemerides are not only useful in supporting space missions, but also in investigating the physical nature of celestial bodies. This paper reports an update to the orbit and rotation model of the Martian moon Phobos. In contrast to earlier numerical models, this paper details a dynamical model that fully considers the rotation of Phobos. Here, Phobos' rotation is first described by Euler's rotational equations and integrated simultaneously with the orbital motion equations. We discuss this dynamical model, along with the differences with respect to the model now in use.
  We present the variational equation for Phobos' rotation employing the symbolic \emph{Maple} computation software. The adjustment test simulations confirm the latitude libration of Phobos, suggesting gravity field coefficients obtained using a shape model and homogeneous density hypothesis should be re-examined in the future in the context of dynamics. Furthermore, the simulations with different $k_2$ values indicate that it is difficult to determine k_2 efficiently using the current data.</description>

      <title>Determining the population of Large Meteoroids in Major Meteor Showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have estimated the largest meteoroids present in major meteor showers from observations conducted between 2019-2022 by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instrument on the GOES-R satellites. Our integrated time area products for the Leonids, Perseids and eta Aquariids are of order 5 x 10^10 km2 hours. We compute photometric masses for shower fireballs using the approach of Vojacek et al. 2022 to correct from narrow-band GLM luminosity to bolometric luminosity and apply the luminous efficiency relation of Ceplecha and McCrosky 1976 at high speeds. Between 2019 and 2022, the showers definitely observed by GLM were the Leonids, Perseids, and eta Aquariids, with probable detections of the Orionids and Taurids. We find the largest meteoroids to be of order 7 kg for the Leonids, 3 kg for the Perseids, and 3 kg for the eta Aquariids, corresponding to meteoroids of ~ 0.2m diameter. The Orionids and Taurids had maximum meteoroid masses of 4 kg and 150 kg respectively. The Leonids and eta Aquariids are well fit by a single power-law with differential mass exponent, s, of 2.08 +/- 0.08 and 2.00 +/- 0.09 over the mass range 10^-7 &lt; m &lt; 1 kg. All showers had maximum meteoroid masses compatible with Whipple gas-drag ejection, with the exception of the Perseids which have much larger meteoroids than expected which is also consistent with observations from ground based instruments. This may reflect preferential ejection in narrow jets or possibly some form of mantle erosion/release in the past for the parent comet, 109P/Swift-Tuttle.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent long-term hydrodynamic simulations of the inner protoplanetary disk III: The influence of photoevaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final stages of a protoplanetary disk are essential for our understanding of the formation and evolution of planets. Photoevaporation is an important mechanism that contributes to the dispersal of an accretion disk and has significant consequences for the disk's lifetime. However, the combined effects of photoevaporation and star-disk interaction have not been investigated in previous studies. We combined an implicit disk evolution model with a photoevaporative mass-loss profile. By including the innermost disk regions down to 0.01 AU, we could calculate the star-disk interaction, the stellar spin evolution, and the transition from an accreting disk to the propeller regime self-consistently. Starting from an early Class II star-disk system, we calculated the long-term evolution of the system until the disk becomes almost completely dissolved. Photoevaporation has a significant effect on disk structure and evolution. The radial extent of the dead zone decreases, and the number of episodic accretion events (outbursts) is reduced by high stellar X-ray luminosities. Reasonable accretion rates in combination with photoevaporative gaps are possible for a dead zone that is still massive enough to develop episodic accretion events. Furthermore, the stellar spin evolution during the Class II evolution is less affected by the star-disk interaction in the case of high X-ray luminosities. Our results suggest that the formation of planets, especially habitable planets, in the dead zone is strongly impaired in the case of strong X-ray luminosities. Additionally, the importance of the star-disk interaction during the Class II phase with respect to the stellar spin evolution is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of celestial bodies have been considered as dark matter detectors. Which stands the best chance of delivering the discovery of dark matter? Which is the most powerful dark matter detector? We investigate a range of objects, including the Sun, Earth, Jupiter, Brown Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, Stellar populations, and Exoplanets. We quantify how different objects are optimal dark matter detectors in different regimes by deconstructing some of the in-built assumptions in these search sensitivities, including observation potential and particle model assumptions. We show how different objects can be expected to deliver corroborating signals. We discuss different search strategies, their opportunities and limitations, and the interplay of regimes where different celestial objects are optimal dark matter detectors.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of radii &lt;20km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>

      <title>Spelunker: A quick-look Python pipeline for JWST NIRISS FGS Guide Star Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope produces some of the highest sensitivity imaging of the cosmos across all instruments. One of them, the NIRISS Fine Guidance Sensor, provides guide star imaging with a passband of 0.6 to 5 microns through two separate channels, each with a 2.3' x 2.3' field of view (FOV) and a sampling rate of 64 ms$-$data that is taken in parallel and is thus available for every JWST observing program. While the onboard system uses guide stars to provide information to the attitude control system (ACS), which stabilizes the observatory, the astronomical community can also use the data products associated with these 64 ms cadence images as science products. Usages range from studying guide star photometry in search of transient phenomena to using these data to identify and investigate technical anomalies that might occur during scientific observations with the rest of the JWST instruments. Despite this wide range of possible usages, these data products are not straightforward to manipulate and analyze, and there is no publicly available package to download, investigate, and research guide star data. Spelunker is a Python library that was developed to enable access to these guide star data products and their analysis.</description>

      <title>Introducing two improved methods for approximating radiative cooling in hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many astrophysical systems depends strongly on the balance between heating and cooling, in particular star formation in giant molecular clouds and the evolution of young protostellar systems. Protostellar discs are susceptible to the gravitational instability, which can play a key role in their evolution and in planet formation. The strength of the instability depends on the rate at which the system loses thermal energy. To study the evolution of these systems, we require radiative cooling approximations because full radiative transfer is generally too expensive to be coupled to hydrodynamical models. Here we present two new approximate methods for computing radiative cooling that make use of the polytropic cooling approximation. This approach invokes the assumption that each parcel of gas is located within a spherical pseudo-cloud which can then be used to approximate the optical depth. The first method combines the methods introduced by Stamatellos et al. and Lombardi et al. to overcome the limitations of each method at low and high optical depths respectively. The second, the "Modified Lombardi" method, is specifically tailored for self-gravitating discs. This modifies the scale height estimate from the method of Lombardi et al. using the analytical scale height for a self-gravitating disc. We show that the Modified Lombardi method provides an excellent approximation for the column density in a fragmenting disc, a regime in which the existing methods fail to recover the clumps and spiral structures. We therefore recommend this improved radiative cooling method for more realistic simulations of self-gravitating discs.</description>

      <title>Secular Structure of 1:2 and 1:3 Resonances with Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1:N mean motion resonances with Neptune are of particular interest because they have two asymmetric resonance islands, where the distribution of trapped objects may bear important clues to the history of the Solar System. To explore the dynamics of these resonances and to investigate whether the imprints left by the early stage evolution can be preserved in the resonances, we conduct a comprehensive analyses on the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. Adopt mainly the frequency analysis method, we calculate the proper frequencies of the motion of objects in the resonances, with which the secular mechanisms that influence the dynamics are determined. Use the spectral number as an indicator of orbital regularity, we construct dynamical maps on representative planes. By comparing the structures in the maps with the locations of the secular mechanisms, we find that the von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the $g=2s$ mechanism destabilize the influenced orbits and portray the overall structure of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances. The secular resonance $2g-s=s_8$ opens a channel for objects to switch between the leading and trailing resonance islands, which can alter the population ratio between these two islands. The secondary resonances associated with the quasi 2:1 resonance between Uranus and Neptune are also detected, and they introduce more chaos to the motion. The fine dynamical structures of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances revealed in this paper, combined with knowledge of resonant capture, provide a compelling explanation for the eccentricity distribution of observed Twotinos. And we anticipate a more complete understanding of the history of planetary migration in the Solar System can be achieved by comparing the results in this paper with the populations in the 1:N resonances in future when further observations bring us more objects.</description>
