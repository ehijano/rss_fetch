      <title>Error analysis of a pressure correction method with explicit time stepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressure-correction method is a well established approach for simulating unsteady, incompressible fluids. It is well-known that implicit discretization of the time derivative in the momentum equation e.g. using a backward differentiation formula with explicit handling of the nonlinear term results in a conditionally stable method. In certain scenarios, employing explicit time integration in the momentum equation can be advantageous, as it avoids the need to solve for a system matrix involving each differential operator. Additionally, we will demonstrate that the fully discrete method can be expressed in the form of simple matrix-vector multiplications allowing for efficient implementation on modern and highly parallel acceleration hardware.
  Despite being a common practice in various commercial codes, there is currently no available literature on error analysis for this scenario. In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis of both implicit and two explicit variants of the pressure-correction method in a fully discrete setting. We demonstrate to which extend the presented implicit and explicit methods exhibit conditional stability. Furthermore, we establish a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) type condition for the explicit scheme and show that the explicit variant demonstrate the same asymptotic behavior as the implicit variant when the CFL condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Distributed memory parallel adaptive tensor-train cross approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor-train (TT) format is a data-sparse tensor representation commonly used in high dimensional function approximations arising from computational and data sciences. Various sequential and parallel TT decomposition algorithms have been proposed for different tensor inputs and assumptions. In this paper, we propose subtensor parallel adaptive TT cross, which partitions a tensor onto distributed memory machines with multidimensional process grids, and constructs an TT approximation iteratively with tensor elements. We derive two iterative formulations for pivot selection and TT core construction under the distributed memory setting, conduct communication and scaling analysis of the algorithm, and illustrate its performance with multiple test experiments. These include up to 6D Hilbert tensors and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy with greatly reduced storage requirements via the TT cross approximation. Furthermore, we demonstrate good to optimal strong and weak scaling performance for the proposed parallel algorithm.</description>

      <title>An implementation of hp-FEM for the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discretization of the $1d$-integral Dirichlet fractional Laplacian by $hp$-finite elements. We present quadrature schemes to set up the stiffness matrix and load vector that preserve the exponential convergence of $hp$-FEM on geometric meshes. The schemes are based on Gauss-Jacobi and Gauss-Legendre rules. We show that taking a number of quadrature points slightly exceeding the polynomial degree is enough to preserve root exponential convergence. The total number of algebraic operations to set up the system is $\mathcal{O}(N^{5/2})$, where $N$ is the problem size. Numerical example illustrate the analysis. We also extend our analysis to the fractional Laplacian in higher dimensions for $hp$-finite element spaces based on shape regular meshes.</description>

      <title>Domain Uncertainty Quantification for the Lippmann-Schwinger Volume Integral Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the propagation of acoustic waves in unbounded domains characterized by a constant wavenumber, except possibly in a bounded region. The geometry of this inhomogeneity is assumed to be uncertain, and we are particularly interested in studying the propagation of this behavior throughout the physical model considered. A key step in our analysis consists of recasting the physical model-originally set in an unbounded domain-into a computationally manageable formulation based on Volume Integral Equations (VIEs), particularly the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We show that both the leading operator in this volume integral formulation and its solution depend holomorphically on shape variations of the support of the aforementioned inhomogeneity. This property, known as shape holomorphy, is crucial in the analysis and implementation of various methods used in computational Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We explore the implications of this result in forward and inverse UQ and provide numerical experiments illustrating and confirming the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A two-step surrogate method for sequential uncertainty quantification in high-dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive estimation, which comprises model calibration, model prediction, and validation, is a common objective when performing inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) in diverse scientific applications. These techniques typically require thousands to millions of realisations of the forward model, leading to high computational costs. Surrogate models are often used to approximate these simulations. However, many surrogate models suffer from the fundamental limitation of being unable to estimate plausible high-dimensional outputs, inevitably compromising their use in the UQ framework. To address this challenge, this study introduces an efficient surrogate modelling workflow tailored for high-dimensional outputs. Specifically, a two-step approach is developed: (1) a dimensionality reduction technique is used for extracting data features and mapping the original output space into a reduced space; and (2) a multivariate surrogate model is constructed directly on the reduced space. The combined approach is shown to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model while retaining the computational efficiency required for UQ inversion. The proposed surrogate method, combined with Bayesian inference, is evaluated for a civil engineering application by performing inverse analyses on a laterally loaded pile problem. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over traditional surrogate methods in dealing with high-dimensional outputs for sequential inversion analysis.</description>

      <title>A parallel batch greedy algorithm in reduced basis methods: Convergence rates and numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "classical" (weak) greedy algorithm is widely used within model order reduction in order to compute a reduced basis in the offline training phase: An a posteriori error estimator is maximized and the snapshot corresponding to the maximizer is added to the basis. Since these snapshots are determined by a sufficiently detailed discretization, the offline phase is often computationally extremely costly. We suggest to replace the serial determination of one snapshot after the other by a parallel approach. In order to do so, we introduce a batch size $b$ and add $b$ snapshots to the current basis in every greedy iteration. These snapshots are computed in parallel. We prove convergence rates for this new batch greedy algorithm and compare them to those of the classical (weak) greedy algorithm in the Hilbert and Banach space case. Then, we present numerical results where we apply a (parallel) implementation of the proposed algorithm to the linear elliptic thermal block problem. We analyze the convergence rate as well as the offline and online wall-clock times for different batch sizes. We show that the proposed variant can significantly speed-up the offline phase while the size of the reduced problem is only moderately increased. The benefit of the parallel batch greedy increases for more complicated problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconvolution with a box (square wave) is a key operation for super-resolution with pixel-shift cameras. In general convolution with a box is not invertible. However, we can obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse signals using convex optimization. We give a direct proof that improves on the reconstruction bound that follows from previous results. We also show our bound is tight and matches an information theoretic limit.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical dynamical low-rank algorithm for the stochastic description of large reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic description of chemical reaction networks with the kinetic chemical master equation (CME) is important for studying biological cells, but it suffers from the curse of dimensionality: The amount of data to be stored grows exponentially with the number of chemical species and thus exceeds the capacity of common computational devices for realistic problems. Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>High-order conservative and accurately dissipative numerical integrators via auxiliary variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods for the simulation of transient systems with structure-preserving properties are known to exhibit greater accuracy and physical reliability, in particular over long durations. These schemes are often built on powerful geometric ideas for broad classes of problems, such as Hamiltonian or reversible systems. However, there remain difficulties in devising timestepping schemes that conserve non-quadratic invariants or dissipation laws. In this work, we propose an approach for the construction of timestepping schemes that preserve dissipation laws and conserve multiple general invariants, via finite elements in time and the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables. The approach generalises several existing ideas in the literature, including Gauss methods, the framework of Cohen &amp; Hairer, and the energy- and helicity-conserving scheme of Rebholz. We demonstrate the ideas by devising novel arbitrary-order schemes that conserve to machine precision all known invariants of Hamiltonian ODEs, including the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, and arbitrary-order schemes for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations that conserve mass, momentum, and energy, and provably possess non-decreasing entropy.</description>

      <title>Physics-embedded Fourier Neural Network for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solving complex spatiotemporal dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) using frequency domain-based discrete learning approaches, such as Fourier neural operators. Despite their widespread use for approximating nonlinear PDEs, the majority of these methods neglect fundamental physical laws and lack interpretability. We address these shortcomings by introducing Physics-embedded Fourier Neural Networks (PeFNN) with flexible and explainable error control. PeFNN is designed to enforce momentum conservation and yields interpretable nonlinear expressions by utilizing unique multi-scale momentum-conserving Fourier (MC-Fourier) layers and an element-wise product operation. The MC-Fourier layer is by design translation- and rotation-invariant in the frequency domain, serving as a plug-and-play module that adheres to the laws of momentum conservation. PeFNN establishes a new state-of-the-art in solving widely employed spatiotemporal PDEs and generalizes well across input resolutions. Further, we demonstrate its outstanding performance for challenging real-world applications such as large-scale flood simulations.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic interpretability of large language models with applications to the financial services industry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further. We observe that the (positive) heads $10.2$ (head $2$, layer $10$), $10.7$, and $11.3$, as well as the (negative) heads $9.6$ and $10.6$ play a significant role in the task completion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boolean Network (BN) and its extension Probabilistic Boolean Network (PBN) are popular mathematical models for studying genetic regulatory networks. BNs and PBNs are also applied to model manufacturing systems, financial risk and healthcare service systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Greedy Entry Removal (GER) algorithm for constructing sparse PBNs. We derive theoretical upper bounds for both existing algorithms and the GER algorithm. Furthermore, we are the first to study the lower bound problem of the construction of sparse PBNs, and to derive a series of related theoretical results. In our numerical experiments based on both synthetic and practical data, GER gives the best performance among state-of-the-art sparse PBN construction algorithms and outputs sparsest possible decompositions on most of the transition probability matrices being tested.</description>

      <title>Numerical Eigenvalue Optimization by Shape-Variations for Maxwell's Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the free-form optimization of eigenvalues in electromagnetic systems by means of shape-variations with respect to small deformations. The objective is to optimize a particular eigenvalue to a target value. We introduce the mixed variational formulation of the Maxwell eigenvalue problem introduced by Kikuchi (1987) in function spaces of (H(\operatorname{curl}; \Omega)) and (H^1(\Omega)). To handle this formulation, suitable transformations of these spaces are utilized, e.g., of Piola-type for the space of (H(\operatorname{curl}; \Omega)). This allows for a formulation of the problem on a fixed reference domain together with a domain mapping. Local uniqueness of the solution is obtained by a normalization of the the eigenfunctions. This allows us to derive adjoint formulas for the derivatives of the eigenvalues with respect to domain variations. For the solution of the resulting optimization problem, we develop a particular damped inverse BFGS method that allows for an easy line search procedure while retaining positive definiteness of the inverse Hessian approximation. The infinite dimensional problem is discretized by mixed finite elements and a numerical example shows the efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new training algorithm for variety of deep neural networks that utilize random complex exponential activation functions. Our approach employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure to iteratively train network layers, avoiding global and gradient-based optimization while maintaining error control. It consistently attains the theoretical approximation rate for residual networks with complex exponential activation functions, determined by network complexity. Additionally, it enables efficient learning of multiscale and high-frequency features, producing interpretable parameter distributions. Despite using sinusoidal basis functions, we do not observe Gibbs phenomena in approximating discontinuous target functions.</description>

      <title>Subspace power method for symmetric tensor decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Subspace Power Method (SPM) for calculating the CP decomposition of low-rank real symmetric tensors. This algorithm calculates one new CP component at a time, alternating between applying the shifted symmetric higher-order power method (SS-HOPM) to a certain modified tensor, constructed from a matrix flattening of the original tensor; and using appropriate deflation steps. We obtain rigorous guarantees for SPM regarding convergence and global optima for input tensors of dimension $d$ and order $m$ of rank up to $O(d^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor})$, via results in classical algebraic geometry and optimization theory. As a by-product of our analysis we prove that SS-HOPM converges unconditionally, settling a conjecture of Kolda-Mayo. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SPM is roughly one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CP decomposition algorithms at moderate ranks. Furthermore, prior knowledge of the CP rank is not required by SPM.</description>

      <title>Macro-micro decomposition for consistent and conservative model order reduction of hyperbolic shallow water moment equations: A study using POD-Galerkin and dynamical low rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geophysical flow simulations using hyperbolic shallow water moment equations require an efficient discretization of a potentially large system of PDEs, the so-called moment system. This calls for tailored model order reduction techniques that allow for efficient and accurate simulations while guaranteeing physical properties like mass conservation. In this paper, we develop the first model reduction for the hyperbolic shallow water moment equations and achieve mass conservation. This is accomplished using a macro-micro decomposition of the model into a macroscopic (conservative) part and a microscopic (non-conservative) part with subsequent model reduction using either POD-Galerkin or dynamical low-rank approximation only on the microscopic (non-conservative) part. Numerical experiments showcase the performance of the new model reduction methods including high accuracy and fast computation times together with guaranteed conservation and consistency properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel and mathematically transparent approach to function approximation and the training of large, high-dimensional neural networks, based on the approximate least-squares solution of associated Fredholm integral equations of the first kind by Ritz-Galerkin discretization, Tikhonov regularization and tensor-train methods. Practical application to supervised learning problems of regression and classification type confirm that the resulting algorithms are competitive with state-of-the-art neural network-based methods.</description>

      <title>A moment approach for entropy solutions of parameter-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10043v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method to solve parameter-dependent hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a moment approach, based on a previous work from Marx et al. (2020). This approach relies on a very weak notion of solution of nonlinear equations, namely parametric entropy measure-valued (MV) solutions, satisfying linear equations in the space of Borel measures. The infinite-dimensional linear problem is approximated by a hierarchy of convex, finite-dimensional, semidefinite programming problems, called Lasserre's hierarchy. This gives us a sequence of approximations of the moments of the occupation measure associated with the parametric entropy MV solution, which is proved to converge. In the end, several post-treatments can be performed from this approximate moments sequence. In particular, the graph of the solution can be reconstructed from an optimization of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel associated with the approximate measure, that is a powerful approximation tool able to capture a large class of irregular functions. Also, for uncertainty quantification problems, several quantities of interest can be estimated, sometimes directly such as the expectation of smooth functionals of the solutions. The performance of our approach is evaluated through numerical experiments on the inviscid Burgers equation with parametrised initial conditions or parametrised flux function.</description>

      <title>Quinpi: Integrating stiff hyperbolic systems with implicit high order finite volume schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many interesting physical problems described by systems of hyperbolic conservation laws are stiff, and thus impose a very small time-step because of the restrictive CFL stability condition. In this case, one can exploit the superior stability properties of implicit time integration which allows to choose the time-step only from accuracy requirements, and thus avoid the use of small time-steps. We discuss an efficient framework to devise high order implicit schemes for stiff hyperbolic systems without tailoring it to a specific problem. The nonlinearity of high order schemes, due to space- and time-limiting procedures which control nonphysical oscillations, makes the implicit time integration difficult, e.g.~because the discrete system is nonlinear also on linear problems. This nonlinearity of the scheme is circumvented as proposed in (Puppo et al., Comm.~Appl.~Math.~\&amp; Comput., 2023) for scalar conservation laws, where a first order implicit predictor is computed to freeze the nonlinear coefficients of the essentially non-oscillatory space reconstruction, and also to assist limiting in time. In addition, we propose a novel conservative flux-centered a-posteriori time-limiting procedure using numerical entropy indicators to detect troubled cells. The numerical tests involve classical and artificially devised stiff problems using the Euler's system of gas-dynamics.</description>

      <title>SCTBEM: A scaled coordinate transformation boundary element method with 99-line MATLAB code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Scaled Coordinate Transformation Boundary Element Method (SCTBEM), a novel boundary-type method for solving 3D potential problems. To address the challenges of applying the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to complex problems, it is common practice to use the fundamental solution corresponding to the partial governing equation operator to establish the integral equation. However, this approach introduces domain integral, which may jeopardize the dimensionality reduction advantages of BEM. To preserve the benefits of dimensionality reduction, this paper proposes a novel domain integral transformation method known as the Scaled Coordinate Transformation (SCT). The SCT is purely a mathematical operation that does not rely on particular solution of operators, which requires only discretization on the structure's surface while remaining analytical in the radial direction. An even better novelty is that the lower-order singularity can be eliminated by coordinate translation technique. To facilitate the wider adoption of BEM, the authors present 99-line MATLAB code. Numerical results confirm that the SCTBEM exhibits high numerical accuracy even when dealing with complex model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly oscillatory differential equations present significant challenges in numerical treatments. The Modulated Fourier Expansion (MFE), used as an ansatz, is a commonly employed tool as a numerical approximation method. In this article, the Modulated Fourier Expansion is analytically derived for a linear partial differential equation with a multifrequency highly oscillatory potential. The solution of the equation is expressed as a convergent Neumann series within the appropriate Sobolev space. The proposed approach enables, firstly, to derive a general formula for the error associated with the approximation of the solution by MFE, and secondly, to determine the coefficients for this expansion -- without the need to solve numerically the system of differential equations to find the coefficients of MFE. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven micromorphic mechanics for materials with strain localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the role of generalized continuum mechanics, and the feasibility of model-free data-driven computing approaches thereof, in solids undergoing failure by strain localization. Specifically, we set forth a methodology for capturing material instabilities using data-driven mechanics without prior information regarding the failure mode. We show numerically that, in problems involving strain localization, the standard data-driven framework for Cauchy/Boltzmann continua fails to capture the length scale of the material, as expected. We address this shortcoming by formulating a generalized data-driven framework for micromorphic continua that effectively captures both stiffness and length-scale information, as encoded in the material data, in a model-free manner. These properties are exhibited systematically in a one-dimensional softening bar problem and further verified through selected plane-strain problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson Acceleration (AA) is a popular algorithm designed to enhance the convergence of fixed-point iterations. In this paper, we introduce a variant of AA based on a Truncated Gram-Schmidt process (AATGS) which has a few advantages over the classical AA. In particular, an attractive feature of AATGS is that its iterates obey a three-term recurrence in the situation when it is applied to solving symmetric linear problems and this can lead to a considerable reduction of memory and computational costs. We analyze the convergence of AATGS in both full-depth and limited-depth scenarios and establish its equivalence to the classical AA in the linear case. We also report on the effectiveness of AATGS through a set of numerical experiments, ranging from solving nonlinear partial differential equations to tackling nonlinear optimization problems. In particular, the performance of the method is compared with that of the classical AA algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation involving the fractional Laplacian with exponent $\alpha\in (1,2)$ in one and two space dimensions. By decomposing the fractional Laplacian into a first order derivative and a fractional integral, we prove $L^2$-stability of the semi-discrete LDG scheme incorporating suitable interface and boundary fluxes. We analyze the error estimate by considering linear convection term and utilizing the estimate, we derive the error estimate for general nonlinear flux and demonstrate an order of convergence $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1/2})$. Moreover, the stability and error analysis have been extended to multiple space dimensional case. Numerical illustrations are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme by obtaining an optimal order of convergence.</description>

      <title>Geometrical mixed finite element methods for fourth order obstacle problems in linearised elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a novel mixed Finite Element Method for approximating the solutions of fourth order variational problems subjected to a constraint.
  The first problem we consider consists in establishing the convergence of the error of the numerical approximation of the solution of a biharmonic obstacle problem. The contents of this section are meant to generalise the approach originally proposed by Ciarlet \&amp; Raviart, and then complemented by Ciarlet \&amp; Glowinski. The second problem we consider amounts to studying a two-dimensional variational problem for linearly elastic shallow shells subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. We first study the case where the parametrisation of the middle surface for the linearly elastic shallow shell under consideration has non-zero curvature, and we observe that the numerical approximation of this model via a mixed Finite Element Method based on conforming elements requires the implementation of the additional constraint according to which the gradient matrix of the dual variable has to be symmetric. However, differently from the biharmonic obstacle problem previously studied, we show that the numerical implementation of this result cannot be implemented by solely resorting to Courant triangles. Finally, we show that if the middle surface of the linearly elastic shallow shell under consideration is flat, the symmetry constraint required for formulating the constrained mixed variational problem announced in the second part of the paper is not required, and the solution can thus be approximated by solely resorting to Courant triangles.
  The theoretical results we derived are complemented by a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Potential of Random Equations with Mixture Models: Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the general modeling and practical simulation of random equations with mixture model parameter random variables. Random equations, understood as stationary (non-dynamical) equations with parameters as random variables, have a long history and a broad range of applications. The specific novelty of this explorative study lies on the demonstration of the combinatorial complexity of these equations with mixture model parameters. In a Bayesian argumentation framework we derive a general likelihood function and posterior density of approximate best fit solutions while avoiding significant restrictions about the type of nonlinearity of the equation or mixture models, and demonstrate their numerically efficient implementation for the applied researcher. In the results section, we are specifically focusing on expressive example simulations of approximate likelihood/posterior solutions for random linear equation systems, nonlinear systems of random conic section equations, as well as applications to portfolio optimization, stochastic control and random matrix theory in order to show the wide applicability of the presented methodology.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Learning for Provable One Step Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the characteristic generator, a novel one-step generative model that combines the efficiency of sampling in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the stable performance of flow-based models. Our model is driven by characteristics, along which the probability density transport can be described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Specifically, We estimate the velocity field through nonparametric regression and utilize Euler method to solve the probability flow ODE, generating a series of discrete approximations to the characteristics. We then use a deep neural network to fit these characteristics, ensuring a one-step mapping that effectively pushes the prior distribution towards the target distribution. In the theoretical aspect, we analyze the errors in velocity matching, Euler discretization, and characteristic fitting to establish a non-asymptotic convergence rate for the characteristic generator in 2-Wasserstein distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough analysis for simulation-free one step generative models. Additionally, our analysis refines the error analysis of flow-based generative models in prior works. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the characteristic generator achieves high generation quality with just a single evaluation of neural network.</description>
