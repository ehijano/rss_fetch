      <title>A Heterogeneous Spatiotemporal GARCH Model: A Predictive Framework for Volatility in Financial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a heterogeneous spatiotemporal GARCH model for geostatistical data or processes on networks, e.g., for modelling and predicting financial return volatility across firms in a latent spatial framework. The model combines classical GARCH(p, q) dynamics with spatially correlated innovations and spatially varying parameters, estimated using local likelihood methods. Spatial dependence is introduced through a geostatistical covariance structure on the innovation process, capturing contemporaneous cross-sectional correlation. This dependence propagates into the volatility dynamics via the recursive GARCH structure, allowing the model to reflect spatial spillovers and contagion effects in a parsimonious and interpretable way. In addition, this modelling framework allows for spatial volatility predictions at unobserved locations. In an empirical application, we demonstrate how the model can be applied to financial stock networks. Unlike other spatial GARCH models, our framework does not rely on a fixed adjacency matrix; instead, spatial proximity is defined in a proxy space constructed from balance sheet characteristics. Using daily log returns of 50 publicly listed firms over a one-year period, we evaluate the model's predictive performance in a cross-validation study.</description>

      <title>Identification of phase correlations in Financial Stock Market Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis of arbitrage methods depends on the circulation of information within the framework of the financial market. Following the work of Modigliani and Miller, it has become a vital part of discussions related to the study of financial networks and predictions. The emergence of the efficient market hypothesis by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll in the early 1970s opened up the door for discussion of information affecting the price in the market and thereby creating asymmetries and price distortion. Whenever the micro and macroeconomic factors change, there is a high probability of information asymmetry in the market, and this asymmetry of information creates turbulence in the market. The analysis and interpretation of turbulence caused by the differences in information is crucial in understanding the nature of the stock market using price patterns and fluctuations. Even so, the traditional approaches are not capable of analyzing the cyclical price fluctuations outside the realm of wave structures of securities prices, and a proper and effective technique to assess the nature of the Financial market. Consequently, the analysis of the price fluctuations by applying the theories and computational techniques of mathematical physics ensures that such cycles are disintegrated, and the outcome of decomposed cycles is elucidated to understand the impression of the information on the genesis and discovery of price and to assess the nature of stock market turbulence. In this regard, the paper will provide a framework of Spectrum analysis that decomposes the pricing patterns and is capable of determining the pricing behavior, eventually assisting in examining the nature of turbulence in the National Stock Exchange of India.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data via Return-Volatility Normalization for Accurate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol (Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale, (2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3) reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases, achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR across various settings.</description>
