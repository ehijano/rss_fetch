      <title>Banach spaces with arbitrary finite Baire order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate intrinsic Baire classes of Banach spaces defined by Argyros, Godefroy and Rosenthal (2003). We introduce a construction, for any Banach space $X$ with a basis, of an $\ell_1$-saturated separable Banach space $Y$ such that for any $\alpha \leqslant \omega_1$ we have $Y^{**}_{1+\alpha} \cong Y \oplus X^{**}_\alpha$, where $X^{**}_\alpha$ denotes the $\alpha$-th intrinsic Baire class of $X$. We apply this construction to answer two open problems by Argyros, Godefroy and Rosenthal (2003), namely we build separable Banach spaces of any Baire order less or equal to $\omega$, and a non-universal separable Banach space of order $\omega_1$. Finally, we apply the construction to show an analogue of a result of Lindenstrauss (1971) by constructing, for any Banach space $X$ with a basis and any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a Banach space $Y$ such that $Y^{**}_n \cong Y^{**}_{n-1} \oplus X$, showing that any such $X$ can appear as the space of functionals in a bidual Banach space $Y^{**}$ that are of $n$-th intrinsic Baire class but not of $(n-1)$-th intrinsic Baire class.</description>

      <title>Operator realizations about a matrix-centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of operator realizations, or ``linear representations" of analytic functions in several non-commuting variables about a matrix-centre. In particular we show that a non-commutative function has a matrix-centre realization about any matrix tuple, $Y$, in its domain, if and only if it is a uniformly analytic non-commutative function defined in a uniformly open neighbourhood of $Y$. This extends the finite-dimensional realization theory of non-commutative rational functions maximally -- to all uniformly analytic non-commutative functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequalities, without symmetry restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nakamura and Tsuji (2024) recently investigated a many-function generalization of the functional Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality, which they refer to as a generalized Legendre duality relation. They showed that, among the class of all even test functions, centered Gaussian functions saturate this general family of functional inequalities. Leveraging a certain entropic duality, we give a short alternate proof of Nakamura and Tsuji's result, and, in the process, eliminate all symmetry assumptions. As an application, we establish a Talagrand-type inequality for the Wasserstein barycenter problem (without symmetry restrictions) originally conjectured by Kolesnikov and Werner (\textit{Adv.~Math.}, 2022). An analogous geometric Blaschke--Santal\'o-type inequality is established for many convex bodies, again without symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>Continuous fragmentation equations in weighted $L^1$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an integro-differential equation that models the evolution of fragmenting clusters. We assume cluster size to be a continuous variable and allow for situations in which mass is not necessarily conserved during each fragmentation event. We formulate the initial-value problem as an abstract Cauchy problem (ACP) in an appropriate weighted $L^1$ space, and apply perturbation results to prove that a unique, physically relevant classical solution of the ACP is given by a strongly continuous semigroup for a wide class of initial conditions. Moreover, we show that it is often possible to identify a weighted $L^1$ space in which this semigroup is analytic, leading to the existence of a unique, physically relevant classical solution for all initial conditions belonging to that space. For some specific fragmentation coefficients, we provide examples of weighted $L^1$ spaces where our results can be applied.</description>

      <title>Inequality, uncertainty principles and their structural analysis for offset linear canonical transform and its quaternion extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work undertakes a twofold investigation. In the first part, we examine the inequalities and uncertainty principles in the framework of offset linear canonical transform (OLCT), with particular attention to its scaling and shifting effects. Theoretical developments are complemented by numerical simulations that substantiate and illustrate the analytical results. In the second part, we establish the connection of quaternion offset linear canonical transform (QOLCT) and the OLCT by employing the orthogonal plane split (OPS) approach. Through this approach, the inequalities and uncertainty principles derived for the OLCT are extended to the QOLCT. Moreover, the computational methods designed for the OLCT may be systematically adapted to facilitate the numerical implementation of the QOLCT using this connection between OLCT and QOLCT.</description>

      <title>Approximation by Neural Network operators in $L^p$ spaces associated with an arbitrary measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximation behavior of both one and multidimensional neural network type operators for functions in $L^p(I^d,\rho)$, where $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, associated with a general measure $\rho$ defined over a hypercube. First, we prove the uniform approximation for a continuous function and the $L^p$ approximation theorem by the NN operators in one and multidimensional settings. In addition, we also obtain the $L^p$ error bounds in terms of $\mathcal{K}$-functionals for these neural network operators. Finally, we consider the logistic and tangent hyperbolic activation functions and verify the hypothesis of the theorems. We also show the implementation of continuous and integrable functions by NN operators with respect to the Lebesgue and Jacobi measures defined on $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ with logistic and tangent hyperbolic activation functions.</description>

      <title>$H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on angular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish boundedness of the $H^\infty$-calculus for the Dirichlet Laplacian on angular domains in $\R^2$ and corresponding wedges on $L^p$-spaces with mixed weights. The weights are based on both the distance to the boundary and the distance to the tip of the underlying domain. Our main motivation comes from the study of stochastic partial differential equations and associated degenerate deterministic parabolic equations on non-smooth domains. As a consequence of our analysis, we also obtain maximal $L^p$-regularity for the Poisson equation on angular domains in appropriate weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Hahn--Banach extensions and inner ideals in real C$^*$-algebras and real JB$^*$-triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every closed (resp., weak$^*$-closed) inner ideal $I$ of a real JB$^*$-triple (resp. a real JBW$^*$-triple) $E$ is Hahn--Banach smooth (resp., weak$^*$-Hahn--Banach smooth). Contrary to what is known for complex JB$^*$-triples, being (weak$^*$-)Hahn--Banach smooth does not characterise (weak$^*$-)closed inner ideals in real JB(W)$^*$-triples. We prove here that a closed (resp., weak$^*$-closed) subtriple of a real JB$^*$-triple (resp., a real JBW$^*$-triple) is Hahn-Banach smooth (resp., weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth) if, and only if, it is a hereditary subtriple. If we assume that $E$ is a reduced and atomic JBW$^*$-triple, every weak$^*$-closed subtriple of $E$ which is also weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth is an inner ideal.\smallskip
  In case that $C$ is the realification of a complex Cartan factor or a non-reduced real Cartan factor, we show that every weak$^*$-closed subtriple of $C$ which is weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth and has rank $\geq 2$ is an inner ideal. The previous conclusions are finally combined to prove the following: Let $I$ be a closed subtriple of a real JB$^*$-triple $E$ satisfying the following hypotheses:
  $(a)$ $I^*$ is separable.
  $(b)$ $I$ is weak$^*$-Hahn-Banach smooth.
  $(c)$ The projection of $I^{**}$ onto each real or complex Cartan factor summand in the atomic part of $E^{**}$ is zero or has rank $\geq 2$.
  Then $I$ is an inner ideal of $E$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we prove criteria for convexity and concavity of $f$-potentials ($f$-means, Kolmogorov means, weighted quasi-arithmetic means), which particular cases are the arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, the thermodynamic potential (exponential mean), and the $L^{p}$-norm. Then we compute in quadratures all functions $f$ satisfying these criteria.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal BV and nonlocal Sobolev spaces induced by nonfractional weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand upon the theory of the space of functions with nonlocal weighted bounded variation, first introduced by Kindermann et.al. in 2005 and later generalized by Wang et.al. in 2014. We consider nonfractional C^1 weights and, using an analogous formulation to the aforementioned works, we also introduce a (to our knowledge) new class of nonlocal weighted Sobolev spaces. After establishing some fundamental properties and results regarding the structure of these spaces, we study their relationship with the classical BV and Sobolev spaces, as well as with the space of test functions. We handle both the case of domains with finite measure and that of domains of infinite measure, and show that these two situations lead to quite different scenarios. As an application, we also show that these function spaces are suitable for establishing existence and uniqueness results of global minimizers for several classes of functionals. Some of these functionals were introduced in the above-mentioned references for the study of image deblurring problems.</description>

      <title>Quantization dimensions of negative order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of defining meaningful upper and lower quantization dimensions for a compactly supported Borel probability measure of order $r$, including negative values of $r$. To this end, we use the concept of partition functions, which generalizes the idea of the $L^{q}$-spectrum and in this way naturally extends the work in [M. Kesseb\"ohmer, A. Niemann, and S. Zhu. Quantization dimensions of probability measures via R\'enyi dimensions. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 376.7 (2023)]. In particular, we provide natural fractal geometric bounds as well as easily verifiable necessary conditions for the existence of the quantization dimensions. The exact asymptotics of the quantization error of negative order for absolutely continuous measures are stated, whereby an open question from [S. Graf, H. Luschgy. Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 136, 3 (2004)] regarding the geometric mean error is also answered in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this work, we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between cyclic quasi-monotonicity and quasi-convexity, focusing on whether every cyclically quasi-monotone (possibly multivalued) map is included in the normal cone operator of a quasi-convex function, in analogy with Rockafellar's theorem for convex functions. We provide a positive answer for $\mathscr{C}^1$-regular, non-vanishing maps in any dimension, as well as for general multi-maps in dimension $1$. We further discuss connections to revealed preference theory in economics and to $L^\infty$ optimal transport. Finally, we present explicit constructions and examples, highlighting the main challenges that arise in the general case.</description>

      <title>Spaces with Riemannian curvature bounds are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a metric space $X$ that, at every point, has a Gromov-Hausdorff tangent with the splitting property (i.e. every geodesic line splits off a factor $\mathbb{R}$), is universally infinitesimally Hilbertian (i.e. $W^{1,2}(X,\mu)$ is a Hilbert space for every measure $\mu$). This connects the infinitesimal geometry of $X$ to its analytic properties and is, to our knowledge, the first general criterion guaranteeing universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity. Using it we establish universal infinitesimal Hilbertianity of finite dimensional RCD-spaces. We moreover show that (possibly infinite dimensional) Alexandrov spaces are universally infinitesimally Hilbertian and construct an isometric embedding of tangent modules.</description>

Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>
