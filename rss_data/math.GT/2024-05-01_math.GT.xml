      <title>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds with uniform spectral gap for coclosed 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two quantifications of being a homology sphere for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, one geometric and one topological: the spectral gap for the Laplacian on coclosed 1-forms and the size of the first torsion homology group. We first construct a sequence of closed hyperbolic integer homology spheres with volume tending to infinity and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap. This answers a question asked by Lin--Lipnowski. We also find sequences of hyperbolic rational homology spheres with the same properties that geometrically converge to a tame limit manifold. Moreover, we show that any such sequence must have unbounded torsion homology growth. Finally we show that a sequence of closed hyperbolic rational homology 3-spheres with uniformly bounded rank and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap must have torsion homology that grows exponentially in volume.</description>

      <title>Tangent cones at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\subset\mathbb{C}^m$ be an unbounded pure $k$-dimensional algebraic set. We define the tangent cones $C_{4, \infty}(X)$ and $C_{5,\infty}(X)$ of $X$ at infinity. We establish some of their properties and relations. We prove that $X$ must be an affine linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^m$ provided that $C_{5, \infty}(X)$ has pure dimension $k$. Also, we study the relation between the tangent cones at infinity and representations of $X$ outside a compact set as a branched covering. Our results can be seen as versions at infinity of results of Whitney and Stutz.</description>

      <title>Computing distances on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemann surfaces are among the simplest and most basic geometric objects. They appear as key players in many branches of physics, mathematics, and other sciences. Despite their widespread significance, how to compute distances between pairs of points on compact Riemann surfaces is surprisingly unknown, unless the surface is a sphere or a torus. This is because on higher-genus surfaces, the distance formula involves an infimum over infinitely many terms, so it cannot be evaluated in practice. Here we derive a computable distance formula for a broad class of Riemann surfaces. The formula reduces the infimum to a minimum over an explicit set consisting of finitely many terms. We also develop a distance computation algorithm, which cannot be expressed as a formula, but which is more computationally efficient on surfaces with high genuses. We illustrate both the formula and the algorithm in application to generalized Bolza surfaces, which are a particular class of highly symmetric compact Riemann surfaces of any genus greater than 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho$ be a representation of a knot group (or more generally, the fundamental group of a tangle complement) into $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ expressed in terms of the Wirtinger generators of a diagram $D$. In this note we give a direct algebraic formula for the geometric parameters of the octahedral decomposition of the knot complement associated to $D$. Our formula gives a new, explicit criterion for whether $\rho$ occurs as a critical point of the diagram's Neumann-Zagier--Yokota potential function.</description>

      <title>The earthquake metric on Teichm{\"u}ller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first paper to systematically study the earthquake metric, an asymmetric Finsler metric on Teichm{\"u}ller space introduced by Thurston. We provide proofs for several assertions of Thurston and establish new properties of this metric, among which are incompleteness,  asymptotic distance to the boundary and comparisons with the Thurston metric and the Weil--Petersson metric.  In doing so, we propose a  novel asymmetric generalisation of the notion of completion for symmetric metrics, which we call the FD-completion, and prove that for the earthquake metric the FD-completion and various symmetrised metric completions coincide with the Weil--Petersson completion. We also answer a question of Thurston by giving an interpretation of this metric arising from a global minimisation problem, namely, the earthquake magnitude minimisation problem. At several points of this paper, we formulate a certain number of open problems which will show that the earthquake metric constitutes a promising subject.</description>

      <title>Obstruction Complexes in Grid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Manolescu-Sarkar constructed a stable homotopy type for link Floer homology, which uses grid homology and accounts for all domains that do not pass through a specific square. In doing so, they produced an obstruction chain complex of the grid diagram with that square removed. We define the obstruction chain complex of the full grid, without the square removed, and compute its homology. Though this homology is too complicated to immediately extend the Manolescu-Sarkar construction, we give results about the existence of sign assignments in grid homology.</description>

      <title>Geometry of extensions of free groups via automorphisms with fixed points on the complex of free factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give conditions of an extension of a free group to be hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic using the dynamics of the action of $\out$ on the complex of free factors combined with the weak attraction theory. We work with subgroups of exponentially growing outer automorphisms and instead of using a standard pingpong argument with loxodromics, we allow fixed points for the action and investigate the geometry of the extension group when the fixed points of the automorphisms on the complex of free factors are sufficiently far apart.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple Crane-Yetter theory varying over the character stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a relative version of the Crane-Yetter topological quantum field theory in four dimensions, from non-semisimple data. Our theory is defined relative to the classical $G$-gauge theory in five dimensions -- this latter theory assigns to each manifold $M$ the appropriate linearization of the moduli stack of $G$-local systems, called the character stack. Our main result is to establish a relative invertibility property for our construction. This invertibility echoes -- recovers and greatly generalizes -- the key invertibility property of the original Crane-Yetter theory which allowed it to capture the framing anomaly of the celebrated Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. In particular our invertibilty statement at the level of surfaces implies a categorical, stacky version of the unicity theorem for skein algebras; at the level of 3-manifolds it equips the character stack with a canonical line bundle. Regarded as a topological symmetry defect of classical gauge theory, our work establishes invertibility of this defect by a gauging procedure.</description>

      <title>Coarse Alexander duality for pairs and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.00059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a group $G$ (of type $F$) acting properly on a coarse Poincar\'{e} duality space $X$, Kapovich-Kleiner introduced a coarse version of Alexander duality between $G$ and its complement in $X$. More precisely, the cohomology of $G$ with group ring coefficients is dual to a certain \v{C}ech homology group of the family of increasing neighborhoods of a $G$-orbit in $X$. This duality applies more generally to coarse embeddings of certain contractible simplicial complexes into coarse $PD(n)$ spaces. In this paper we introduce a relative version of this \v{C}ech homology that satisfies the Eilenberg-Steenrod Exactness Axiom, and we prove a relative version of coarse Alexander duality.
  As an application we provide a detailed proof of the following result, first stated by Kapovich-Kleiner. Given a $2$-complex formed by gluing $k$ halfplanes along their boundary lines and a coarse embedding into a contractible $3$-manifold, the complement consists of $k$ deep components that are arranged cyclically in a pattern called a Jordan cycle. We use the Jordan cycle as an invariant in proving the existence of a $3$-manifold group that is virtually Kleinian but not itself Kleinian.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups.
  Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of CAT(-1) geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations. We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\Gamma,\mathbb{P})$ be a relatively hyperbolic group pair that is relatively one ended. Then the Bowditch boundary of $(\Gamma,\mathbb{P})$ is locally connected. Bowditch previously established this conclusion under the additional assumption that all peripheral subgroups are finitely presented, either one or two ended, and contain no infinite torsion subgroups. We remove these restrictions; we make no restriction on the cardinality of $\Gamma$ and no restriction on the peripheral subgroups $P \in \mathbb{P}$.</description>

Abstract: For the moduli space of the punctured spheres, we find a new equality between two symplectic forms defined on it. Namely, by treating the elements of this moduli space as the singular Euclidean metrics on a sphere, we give an interpretation of the complex hyperbolic form, i.e. the K\"ahler form of the complex hyperbolic structure on the moduli space, as a kind of Weil-Petersson form.</description>

Abstract: We develop a theory of groups that act acylindrically and non-elementarily on simplicial trees, which we call acylindrically arboreal groups. We then prove a complete classification of when graph products of groups and the fundamental groups of certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds are acylindrically arboreal, and use this classification to consider acylindrically hyperbolic groups that have actions on trees but have no non-elementary acylindrical actions on trees.</description>

Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a free-by-free group to be relatively hyperbolic with a cusp-preserving structure. Namely, if $\phi_1, \ldots , \phi_k $ is a collection of exponentially growing outer automorphisms with a common invariant \emph{subgroup system} such that any conjugacy class in the complement of this system grows exponentially under iteration by all $\phi_i$, then such a subgroup system can be used to construct a collection of peripheral subgroups relative to which, the extension of $\mathbb F$ by the free group generated by sufficiently high powers of $\phi_1, \ldots , \phi_k $, will be hyperbolic.</description>
