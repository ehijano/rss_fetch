      <title>Managing cascading disruptions through optimal liability assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconnected agents such as firms in a supply chain make simultaneous preparatory investments to increase chances of honouring their respective bilateral agreements. Failures cascade: if one fails their agreement, then so do all who follow in the chain. Thus, later agents' investments turn out to be pointless when there is an earlier failure. How losses are shared affects how agents invest to avoid the losses in the first place. In this way, a solution sets agent liabilities depending on the point of disruption and induces a supermodular investment game. We characterize all efficient solutions. These have the form that later agents -- who are not directly liable for the disruption -- still shoulder some of the losses, justified on the premise that they might have failed anyway. Importantly, we find that such indirect liabilities are necessary to avoid unbounded inefficiencies. Finally, we pinpoint one efficient solution with several desirable properties.</description>

      <title>The Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07602v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is an optimization problem that involves determining optimal routes and schedules for several vehicles to pick up and deliver items at minimum cost. Motivated by real-world carpooling and crowdshipping scenarios, we introduce an additional constraint imposing a maximum number on the number of pickups per trip. This results in the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip (DARP-LPT). We apply a fragment-based method for DARP-LPT, where a fragment is a partial path. Specifically, we extend two formulations from Rist &amp; Forbes (2021): the Fragment Flow Formulation (FFF) and the Fragment Assignment Formulation (FAF). We establish FFF's superiority over FAF, both from a theoretical as well as from a computational perspective. Furthermore, our results show that FFF and FAF significantly outperform traditional arc-based formulations in terms of solution quality and time. Additionally, compared to the two existing fragment sets, one with longer partial paths and another with shorter ones, our newly generated fragment sets perform better in terms of solution quality and time when fed into FFF.</description>

      <title>Stablecoin Runs and Disclosure Policy in the Presence of Large Sales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins have historically depegged due from par to large sales, possibly of speculative nature, or poor reserve asset quality. Using a global game which addresses both concerns, we show that the selling pressure on stablecoin holders increases in the presence of a large sale. While precise public knowledge reduces (increases) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), interestingly, more precise private signals increase (reduce) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), potentially explaining the stability of opaque stablecoins. The total run probability can be decomposed into components representing risks from large sales and poor collateral. By analyzing how these risk components vary with respect to information uncertainty and fundamentals, we can split the fundamental space into regions based on the type of risk a stablecoin issuer is more prone to. We suggest testable implications and connect our model's implications to real-world applications, including depegging events and the no-questions-asked property of money.</description>

      <title>Aggregating Incomplete Rankings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study considers the method to derive a ranking of alternatives by aggregating the rankings submitted by several individuals who may not evaluate all of them. The collection of subsets of alternatives that individuals (can) evaluate is referred to as an evaluability profile. For a given evaluability profile, we define an aggregating ranking function whose inputs are the rankings of individuals on the alternatives they evaluate. We investigate the properties of aggregating ranking functions, which are modifications of those introduced in previous studies. Whether an aggregating ranking function satisfying a combination of properties exists depends on the evaluability profile. Thus, we identify the necessary and sufficient conditions on evaluability profiles to ensure the existence of the functions satisfying four different combinations of properties. Furthermore, to examine how frequently possible or impossible evaluability profiles occur, we derive the proportion of each type in specific cases.</description>

      <title>Efficiency in Pure-Exchange Economies with Risk-Averse Monetary Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Pareto efficiency in a pure-exchange economy where agents' preferences are represented by risk-averse monetary utilities. These coincide with law-invariant monetary utilities, and they can be shown to correspond to the class of monotone, (quasi-)concave, Schur concave, and translation-invariant utility functionals. This covers a large class of utility functionals, including a variety of law-invariant robust utilities. We show that Pareto optima exist and are comonotone, and we provide a crisp characterization thereof in the case of law-invariant positively homogeneous monetary utilities. This characterization provides an easily implementable algorithm that fully determines the shape of Pareto-optimal allocations. In the special case of law-invariant comonotone-additive monetary utility functionals (concave Yaari-Dual utilities), we provide a closed-form characterization of Pareto optima. As an application, we examine risk-sharing markets where all agents evaluate risk through law-invariant coherent risk measures, a widely popular class of risk measures. In a numerical illustration, we characterize Pareto-optimal risk-sharing for some special types of coherent risk measures.</description>
