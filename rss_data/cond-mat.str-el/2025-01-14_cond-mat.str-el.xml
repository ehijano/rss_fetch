      <title>Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a 3D tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical point) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, by employing the technique of layer susceptibility, we solve the boundary operator expansion using the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D dimensions in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Observation of anisotropic dispersive dark exciton dynamics in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body excitons in CrSBr are attracting intense interest in view of their highly anisotropic magneto-optical coupling and their potential for novel optical interfaces within spintronic and magnonic devices. Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. Ultra-high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr $L_3$-edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the $a$ and $b$ directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one-dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.</description>

      <title>Fermion as a non-local particle-hole excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the fermion, in the context of a system that comprises many such entities - which, by virtue of the Pauli exclusion principle, possesses a Fermi surface at zero temperature - may itself be thought of as a collection of non-local particle-hole excitations across this Fermi surface. This result is purely kinematical and completely general - not being restricted to any specific dimension, applicable to both continuum and lattice systems. There is also no implication that it is applicable only to low-energy phenomena close to the Fermi surface. We are able to derive the full single-particle dynamical Green function of this fermion at finite temperature by viewing it as a collection of these non-local particle-hole excitations. The Green function of the fermion then manifests itself as a solution to a first-order differential equation in a parameter that controls the number of particle-hole pairs across the Fermi surface, and this equation itself reveals variable coefficients that may be identified with a Bose-Einstein distribution - implying that there is a sense in which the non-local particle-hole excitations have bosonic qualities while not being exact bosons at the level of operators. We also recall the definition of the non-local particle-hole operator that may be used to diagonalize the kinetic energy of free fermions of the sort mentioned above. Number-conserving products of creation and annihilation operators of fermions are expressible as a (rather complicated) combination of these non-local particle-hole operators.</description>

      <title>Correlated electronic structures and unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature ($\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$) superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system based on structural parameters integrating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements and ab initio calculations. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). The on-site Coulomb repulsive $\bm{U}$ and electron filling $\bm{n}$ dependencies of the correlated electronic structure are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) methods. The fermi surface topology is substantially changed by $\bm{U}$ around the cRPA value, suggesting the indispensable role of correlation effects. A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach, using $\bm{U=3.5}$ and $\bm{n = 1.3}$, yields a pronounced $\bm{s^{\pm}}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $\bm{d_{z^{2}}}$ characters. Our findings may explain the similar onset $\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$ comparing pressured bulks and strained thin films of the bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial thin films of pyrochlore iridates: a forward looking approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials that show strongly correlated electrons as well as topological order, for which spin-orbit coupling is a key ingredient, exhibit novel states of matter. One such example is the family of pyrochlore iridates, featuring strong spin-orbital coupling, strong electron interactions as well as geometric frustration, making them an ideal platform to study novel topological phases. High-quality epitaxial pyrochlore iridate films, although challenging to produce, provide a pathway to explore unconventional behaviours and unravel the intrinsic properties of these largely unexplored materials. Additionally, designing interfaces with specific properties is crucial to create multilayered devices that can achieve significant technological breakthroughs using topological states of these materials. This article reviews experimental work on epitaxial pyrochlore iridate thin films, discussing evidence of topological phases found in them. Future research directions are outlined, which include exploring the rich tunability offered by chemical doping, especially when combined with the design of epitaxial heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Beyond being free: glassy dynamics of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron glasses offer a convenient laboratory platform to study glassy dynamics. Traditionally, the interplay between long-range Coulomb interactions and disorder is deemed instrumental in stabilizing the electron glass phase. Existing experimental studies on electron glass have focused on doped semiconductors, strongly correlated systems, granular systems, etc., all of which are far from the well-delocalized limit. In this work, we expand the study of electron glasses to a well-known quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and unveil a new scenario: how naturally occurring ferroelastic twin walls of STO could result in glassy electrons, even in a metallic state. We show that the emergent two-dimensional electron gas at the $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/STO interface exhibits long-lasting temporal relaxations in resistance and memory effects at low temperatures, which are hallmarks of glassiness. We also demonstrate that the glass-like relaxations could be further tuned by application of an electric field. This implies that the observed glassy dynamics is connected with the development of polarity near the structural twin walls of STO and the complex interactions among them, arising from the coupling between ferroelastic and ferroelectric orders. The observation of this glassy metal phase not only extends the concept of electron glasses to metallic systems with multiple order parameters but also contributes to the growing understanding of the fascinating and diverse physical phenomena that emerge near the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Hubbard Model with Equivariant Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models, particularly normalizing flows, have shown exceptional performance in learning probability distributions across various domains of physics, including statistical mechanics, collider physics, and lattice field theory. In the context of lattice field theory, normalizing flows have been successfully applied to accurately learn the Boltzmann distribution, enabling a range of tasks such as direct estimation of thermodynamic observables and sampling independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) configurations.
  In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration that normalizing flows can be used to learn the Boltzmann distribution for the Hubbard model. This model is widely employed to study the electronic structure of graphene and other carbon nanomaterials. State-of-the-art numerical simulations of the Hubbard model, such as those based on Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, often suffer from ergodicity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates of physical observables. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that leveraging i.i.d.\ sampling from the normalizing flow effectively addresses these issues.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal charge transport in polar Dirac metals with tunable spin-valley coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in solids, where resistance is different between rightward and leftward currents, is a key function of rectifying devices in the modern electronics, as exemplified by $p$-$n$ semiconductor junctions. Recently, this was also demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials in magnetic fields, since their band structure exhibits spin polarization coupled to the position of momentum space due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. To enhance the magnitude of nonreciprocal effect, it is essential to tune such spin-momentum coupling, which has been hampered in the conventional materials owing to the difficulty in controlling the broken inversion symmetry built into the lattice and interfacial structures. Here we report large nonreciprocal resistivity in layered polar metal BaMn$X_2$ ($X$=Sb, Bi), where the spin-polarized Dirac dispersion depends on the in-plane polarization tunable by chemical substitution of the $X$ site. For $X$=Sb with a pair of single-type valleys, the nonreciprocal resistivity increases monotonically with decreasing temperature, while for $X$=Bi with multiple types of valleys it is reduced by about an order of magnitude and exhibits a peak at a low temperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nonreciprocal resistivity is sensitive not only to the spin-momentum (spin-valley) coupling, but also to the Fermi energy and the Dirac dispersion. The observed significant variation of nonreciprocal transport in the same series of materials might be of great use in the design of junction-free rectifying devices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the heat capacity of Kondo insulator YbB12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe the magnetic quantum oscillation in the heat capacity of the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$. The frequency of these oscillations $F = 670$ T, aligns with findings from magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry experiments for $\mu_0 H &gt; 35$ T in the Kondo insulating phase. Remarkably, the quantum oscillation amplitudes in the heat capacity are substantial, with $\Delta \tilde{C}/T \approx$ 0.5 $\rm{mJ}$ $\rm{mol^{-1}K^{-2}}$ at 0.8 K, accounting for 13$\%$ of the known linear heat capacity coefficient $\gamma$. Double-peak structures of quantum-oscillation amplitudes due to the distribution function of fermions were identified and used to determine the value of the effective mass from the heat capacity, which agrees well with that from torque magnetometry. These observations support charge-neutral fermions contributing to the quantum oscillations in YbB$_{12}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the periodic Anderson model on the square lattice across various band fillings. Employing the infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) technique, we can determine the magnetic ground states accurately and compare them to mean-field predictions to highlight the effects of quantum fluctuations. At half-filling, we analyze the transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic (Kondo singlet) phases as a function of hybridization and $f$-level energy, finding excellent agreement with existing quantum Monte Carlo studies in the case of hybridization. For $n = 1.5$ electrons per site, we identify a novel correlated antiferromagnetic diagonal stripe phase as the ground state, which competes with its ferromagnetic partner state.</description>

      <title>On the role of Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of secondary low-energy electron emission from graphene and graphite. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and an emitted secondary electron, we disentangle specific features otherwise hidden in the essentially featureless secondary electron spectrum. Hand-in-hand with density functional theory calculations, we show that this slow electron emission is governed not only by the density of states in the occupied and unoccupied band structure but is also modulated by the coupling of levels above the vacuum energy to free-vacuum states. This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

      <title>Effects of disorder on the quantum transport properties in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak antilocalization (WAL), an increase in the electrical conductivity at low temperatures associated with the suppression of electron localization due to quantum interference effects, is often observed in topological materials. In this study, we report the observation of WAL in topologically nontrivial metal PbTaSe$_{2}$ at low temperatures. In the pristine sample, we identified the presence of WAL, which is attributed to the topologically protected backscattering. In order to investigate the influence of disorder on the WAL, we successively introduced controlled amounts of disorder by H$^{+}$-irradiation. As disorder increases, the dip-like magnetoresistance caused by WAL changes to a linear magnetoresistance(MR), and eventually to a quadratic MR as the electronic system becomes highly localized. This research unveils the significance of disorder in shaping the quantum transport characteristics of topological materials.</description>

      <title>The 2025 Roadmap to Ultrafast Dynamics: Frontiers of Theoretical and Computational Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of ultrafast phenomena is a frontier of condensed matter research, where the interplay of theory, computation, and experiment is unveiling new opportunities for understanding and engineering quantum materials. With the advent of advanced experimental techniques and computational tools, it has become possible to probe and manipulate nonequilibrium processes at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of matter under extreme conditions. These capabilities have the potential to revolutionize fields ranging from optoelectronics and quantum information to catalysis and energy storage.
  This Roadmap captures the collective progress and vision of leading researchers, addressing challenges and opportunities across key areas of ultrafast science. Contributions in this Roadmap span the development of ab initio methods for time-resolved spectroscopy, the dynamics of driven correlated systems, the engineering of materials in optical cavities, and the adoption of FAIR principles for data sharing and analysis. Together, these efforts highlight the interdisciplinary nature of ultrafast research and its reliance on cutting-edge methodologies, including quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory, correlated electronic structure methods, nonequilibrium Green's function approaches, quantum and ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>

Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 142 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi surface, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring large anomalous Hall response in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnetic skyrmion lattice in Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge by small-angle neutron scattering</title>

Abstract: Incommensurate magnetic phases in chiral cubic crystals are an established source of topological spin textures such as skyrmion and hedgehog lattices, with potential applications in spintronics and information storage. We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the $B20$-type chiral magnet Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge, exploring its magnetic phase diagram and confirming the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice under low magnetic fields. Our results reveal a helical ground state with a decreasing pitch from 40 nm to 35 nm upon cooling, and a skyrmion phase stable in applied magnetic fields of 10-30 mT, and over an unusually wide temperature range for chiral magnets of 6 K ($\sim T_\textrm{C}/2 &lt; T &lt; T_\textrm{C}$, $T_\textrm{C}=13$ K). The skyrmion lattice forms a standard two-dimensional hexagonal coordination that can be trained into a single domain, distinguishing it from the three-dimensional hedgehog lattice observed in MnGe-based systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the persistence of a metastable SkL at 2 K, even at zero field. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic textures in Cr-based $B20$ compounds, highlighting Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge~as a promising material for further exploration in topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Correlation stabilized ferromagnetic MnRuAs with distorted kagome lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of MnRuAs, a compound crystallizing in the P$\bar{6}$2m symmetry with a distorted kagome lattice, revealing its distinctive structural, magnetic, and electronic properties through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. By incorporating strong correlation effects using the DFT+U approach, we demonstrate the stabilization of MnRuAs, transforming its inherent dynamical instability into a robust ferromagnetic state with significant coupling along the $c$ axis. The calculated magnon dispersion reveals a parabolic profile with a minimum at the $\Gamma$ point, indicative of ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere. Our study also delves into the electronic surface states and constant energy contours, offering valuable insights into the complex physics of this material.</description>

Abstract: We show that topological flat minibands can be engineered in a class of narrow gap semiconductor films using only an external electrostatic superlattice potential. We demonstrate that, for realistic material parameters, these bands are capable of hosting correlated topological phases such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and composite Fermi liquid phases at zero magnetic field. Our results provide a path towards the realization of fractionalized topological states in a broad range of materials.</description>

Abstract: The honeycomb Kitaev model describes a $Z_2$ spin liquid with topological order and fractionalized excitations consisting of gapped $\pi$-fluxes and free Majorana fermions. Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid. Magnetic fields are a convenient parameter for tuning between different phases of the Kitaev systems, and have even been investigated for potentially counteracting the effects of other destabilizing interactions leading to a revival of the topological phase. Here we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and topological order.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic &lt;111&gt; axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.</description>

      <title>Pairing tendencies in the doped Kitaev-Heisenberg model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the N\'eel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi liquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides conventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be realized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order" Dirac fermions exhibiting nontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy excitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop a beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground states and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under vertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial Wigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\sim 10^{10}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which are approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently, using a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping effects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous quantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is below $\sim 1\times 10^{11}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground state over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter intuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than the trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from dynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work suggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most promising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method developed in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems including moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moir\'e lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</description>

Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Coulomb liquid phase in few-electron droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Manipulation of Superconducting Properties via Ultrasonic Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>$\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8&lt;T&lt;15$ K and $T&lt;8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.</description>
