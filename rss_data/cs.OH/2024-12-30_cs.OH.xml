      <title>Optimal Traffic Flow in Quantum Annealing-Supported Virtual Traffic Lights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virtual Traffic Light (VTL) eliminates the need for physical traffic signal infrastructure at intersections, leveraging Connected Vehicles (CVs) to optimize traffic flow. VTL assigns right-of-way dynamically based on factors such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), the number of CVs in various lanes, and emission rates. These factors are considered in line with the objectives of the VTL application. Aiming to optimize traffic flow and reduce delays, the VTL system generates Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) data for CVs approaching an intersection, while considering the impact of each CV movement on others. However, the stochastic nature of vehicle arrivals at intersections complicates real-time optimization, challenging classical computing methods. To address this limitation, we develop a VTL method that leverages quantum computing to minimize stopped delays for CVs. The method formulates the VTL problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, a mathematical framework well-suited for quantum computing. Using D-Wave cloud-based quantum computer, our approach determines optimal solutions for right-of-way assignments under the standard National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) phasing system. The system was evaluated using the microscopic traffic simulator SUMO under varying traffic volumes. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-enabled VTL system reduces stopped delays and travel times compared to classical optimization-based systems. This approach not only enhances traffic management efficiency but also reduces the infrastructure costs associated with traditional traffic signals. The quantum computing-supported VTL system offers a transformative solution for large-scale traffic control, providing superior performance across diverse traffic scenarios and paving the way for advanced, cost-effective traffic management.</description>
