      <title>On the nature of information -- an evolutionary perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Perspective explores the origins and persistence of recurrent structures and patterns throughout the known Universe. We start with a first fundamental question: 1. Considering that all information consists of patterns in physical structure but not all physical patterns constitute information, what is the fundamental relation between these two? We first explore the materialistic nature of structures and information, detailing how they can form through spontaneous or templated processes and evolve into complex structures, including self-replicators. We posit that all recurring structures emerge either spontaneously de novo or based on underlying information. A main implication is that all information must be understood as both a product and a driver of evolution. We further observe that the three carriers of information underpin the emergence of three main layers of self-organisation: genes coded in DNA for the biological layer, ideas stored in neural structure for the cultural layer, and records written on innate objects for the civilisation layer. This gives rise to two additional questions, which we subsequently address: 2. What can we anticipate about the future development of self-organizing layers given the role of information in their emergence? 3. What is the universality of information and its evolution throughout the Universe? This manuscript aims to offer a fresh perspective and a universal framework for information and the origin of structures by extending and unifying concepts from physics, biology, and information theory.</description>

      <title>Ising's roots and the transfer-matrix eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today, the Ising model is an archetype describing collective ordering processes. And, as such, it is widely known in physics and far beyond. Less known is the fact that the thesis defended by Ernst Ising 100 years ago (in 1924) contained not only the solution of what we call now the `classical 1D Ising model' but also other problems. Some of these problems, as well as the method of their solution, are the subject of this note. In particular, we discuss the combinatorial method Ernst Ising used to calculate the partition function for a chain of elementary magnets. In the thermodynamic limit, this method leads to the result that the partition function is given by the roots of a certain polynomial. We explicitly show that `Ising's roots' that arise within the combinatorial treatment are also recovered by the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, a concept that was introduced much later. Moreover, we discuss the generalization of the two-state model to a three-state one presented in Ising's thesis, but not included in his famous paper of 1925 (E. Ising, Z.Physik 31 (1925) 253). The latter model can be considered as a forerunner of the now abundant models with many-component order parameters.</description>

      <title>Counterfactuality, back-action, and information gain in multi-path interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of an absorber in one of the paths of an interferometer changes the output statistics of that interferometer in a fundamental manner. Since the individual quantum particles detected at any of the outputs of the interferometer have not been absorbed, any non-trivial effect of the absorber on the distribution of these particles over these paths is a counterfactual effect. Here, we quantify counterfactual effects by evaluating the information about the presence or absence of the absorber obtained from the output statistics, distinguishing between classical and quantum counterfactual effects. We identify the counterfactual gain which quantifies the advantage of quantum counterfactual protocols over classical counterfactual protocols, and show that this counterfactual gain can be separated into two terms: a semi-classical term related to the amplitude blocked by the absorber, and a Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability assigning a joint probability to the blocked path and the output port. A negative Kirkwood-Dirac term between a path and an output port indicates that inserting the absorber into that path will have a focussing effect, increasing the probability of particles arriving at that output port, resulting in a significant enhancement of the counterfactual gain. We show that the magnitude of quantum counterfactual effects cannot be explained by a simple removal of the absorbed particles, but originates instead from a well-defined back-action effect caused by the presence of the absorber in one path, on particles in other paths.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>
