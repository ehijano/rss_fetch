      <title>Thermo-kinetic invariant in anisotropic plasma with heat fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate linear perturbations in an incompressible, weakly collisional, anisotropic plasma, taking heat fluxes into account. Our analysis identifies a new class of time-invariant perturbations that encompass heat flux variations and aperiodic longitudinal perturbations in the magnetic field and flow velocity. Under the Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) approximation, which neglects low-frequency heat flux effects, these perturbations are purely thermal and decoupled from magnetic and velocity fields. When heat fluxes are included, these perturbations gain kinematic and magnetic components, leading to the identification of a ``thermo-kinetic mode.''
  The nature of aperiodic linear modes suggests that they may reach higher amplitudes in perturbation structures, that can be revealed as filamentary formations. We discuss the potential implications of these filaments on the large-scale dynamics of flows and on the nonlinear energy balance within small-scale MHD turbulence. Our findings indicate that thermo-kinetic invariant may play a significant role in modulating turbulence energy transfer dynamics, potentially impacting both local and global flow behavior in weakly collisional anisotropic plasmas.</description>

      <title>A conditional formulation of the Vlasov-Ampere Equations: A conservative, positivity, asymptotic, and Gauss law preserving scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel reformulation of the Vlasov-Amp{\`e}re equations for plasmas. This reformulation exposes discrete symmetries to achieve simultaneous conservation of mass, momentum, and energy; preservation of Gauss's law involution; positivity of the distribution function; and quasi-neutral asymptotics. Our approach relies on transforming variables and coordinates, leading to a coupled system of a modified Vlasov equation and the associated moment-field equations. The modified Vlasov equation evolves a conditional distribution function that excludes information on mass, momentum, and energy densities. The mass, momentum, and energy density, in turn, are evolved using moment equations, in which discrete symmetries, conservation laws, and involution constraints are enforced. The reformulation is compatible with a recent slow-manifold reduction technique, which separates the fast electron time scales and simplifies handling the asymptotic quasi-neutrality limit within the easier to solve moment-field subsystem. Using this new formulation, we develop a numerical approach for the reduced 1D1V subsystem that, for the first time, simultaneously satisfies the important physical constraints while preserving the quasi-neutrality asymptotic limit. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated through canonical electrostatic test problems, including the multiscale ion acoustic shock wave problem.</description>

      <title>Axial Confinement in the Novatron Mirror Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Novatron magnetic mirror fusion reactor concept features significant advantages. These include stability against MHD interchange and kinetic DCLC modes, axisymmetry, and minimized radial particle drifts and neoclassical losses. For achieving a ratio Q &gt; 30 of fusion power to heating power, axial particle confinement is uniquely designed to rely on the simultaneous use of three distinct forces; magnetic mirrors, electrostatic potentials, and ponderomotive forces in a tandem-like configuration. Axial confinement physics theory is here analyzed and compared to earlier mirror configurations. Scenarios for D-T, D-D, and catalyzed D-D fusion plasmas are outlined.</description>

      <title>Impurity radiation seeding of neoclassical tearing mode growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of neoclassical tearing mode (NTM) is of great concern to the tokamak plasma stability and performance, especially in the burning plasma regime. Whereas a great deal about the different seeding mechanisms have been understood, and in many situations the seed event can be clearly identified, the potential seeding process of NTM due to the resistive tearing instability driven by the impurity radiation cooling still needs more studies. Recent NIMROD simulations have demonstrated that the local impurity radiation cooling can drive the seed island growth and trigger the subsequent onset of neoclassical tearing mode instability. The seed island is mainly driven by the local helical perturbation of the diamagnetic current induced by the perturbed pressure gradient as a result of the impurity radiative cooling on the rational surface. A heuristic closure for the neoclassical viscosity is adopted, and the seed island is further driven by the perturbed bootstrap current induced from the neoclassical electron viscous stress in the extended Ohm's law. The growth rate of the NTM in simulations is found proportional to the electron neoclassical viscosity, and a theoretical neoclassical driving term is adopted to account for the nonlinear neoclassical island growth in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. This work examines the potential of ponderomotive optical confinement for ultracold neutral plasma (UNP) using a high-power cw CO$_2$ laser. We identify optimal conditions for experimental realization and investigate transient processes during UNP expansion in the ponderomotive potential. A hollow laser beam simultaneously traps charged particles and Rydberg atoms formed via three-body recombination in UNP in the dark region, alongside neutral atoms in intensity maxima. This dual trapping capability has the potential to be applied in the trapping of antiproton-positron plasma, which could enhance antimatter production.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>Dust Acoustic Rogue Waves in a Cometary Environment with kappa Distributed Electrons and Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged dust is present in almost all astrophysical and laboratory plasma environments. They alter the plasma charge density and also give rise to various modes of electrostatic waves and oscillations. In this paper we study the properties of Dust Acoustic Rogue Waves (DARW) in a cometary environment with positively and negatively charged dust components, kappa distributed - protons and electrons. Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) is derived using reductive perturbation method and analysed for modulational instability. The system is found to be modulationally unstable above some particular value of wave number($k=0.5$), after which the system is unstable. The solution for rogue waves is tested in this environment theoretically. Amplitude and structure of first and second order rogue waves are compared for various plasma parameters. Higher charge number of positive dust, $(z_+ &gt; z_-)$ decreases the amplitude of RWs, while higher number density of positive dust $(n_+&gt;n_-)$ ions increases it. As number density of proton $(n_i)$ increases the amplitude of RW decreases. Peak values increase with number density exponentially for positive and linearly for negative dust ions. It increases linearly with charge number of both positive and negative dust ions. Peak value decreases exponentially for number density of proton.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reconnection with effective resistivity: I. Dynamics and reconnection rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic magnetic reconnection is one of the most fundamental mechanisms considered responsible for the acceleration of relativistic particles in astrophysical jets and magnetospheres of compact objects. Understanding the properties of the dissipation of magnetic fields and the formation of non-ideal electric fields is of paramount importance to quantify the efficiency of reconnection at energizing charged particles. Recent results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggest that the fundamental properties of how magnetic fields dissipate in a current sheet might be captured by an ``effective resistivity'' formulation, which would locally enhance the amount of magnetic energy dissipated and favor the onset of fast reconnection. Our goal is to assess this ansatz quantitatively by comparing fluid models of magnetic reconnection with a non-constant magnetic diffusivity and fully-kinetic models. We perform 2D resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection combined to PIC simulations using the same initial conditions (namely a Harris current sheet). We explore the impact of crucial parameters such as the plasma magnetization, its mass density, the grid resolution, and the characteristic plasma skin depth. Our ResRMHD models with effective resistivity can quantitatively reproduce the dynamics of fully-kinetic models of relativistic magnetic reconnection. In particular, they lead to reconnection rates consistent with PIC simulations, while for constant-resistivity fluid models the reconnection dynamics is generally 10 times slower. Even at modest resolutions the adoption of an effective resistivity can qualitatively capture the properties of kinetic reconnection models and produce reconnection rates compatible with collisionless models, i.e. of the order of $\sim10^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Impurity Parallel Velocity Gradient instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetized plasmas, a radial gradient of parallel velocity, where parallel refers to the direction of magnetic field, can destabilise an electrostatic mode called Parallel Velocity Gradient (PVG). The theory of PVG has been mainly developed assuming a single species of ions. Here, the role of impurities is investigated based on a linear, local analysis, in a homogeneous, constant magnetic field. To further simplify the analysis, the plasma is assumed to contain only two ion species - main ions and one impurity species - while our methodology can be straightforwardly extended to more species. In the cold-ion limit, retaining polarization drift for both main ions and impurity ions, and assuming Boltzmann electrons, the system is described by 4 fluid equations closed by quasi-neutrality. The linearized equations can be reduced to 2 coupled equations: one for the electric potential, and one for the effective parallel velocity fluctuations, which is a linear combination of main ion and impurity parallel velocity fluctuations. This reduced system can be understood as a generalisation of the Hasegawa-Mima model. With finite radial gradient of impurity parallel flow, the linear dispersion relation then describes a new instability: the impurity-modified PVG (i-PVG). Instability condition is described in terms of either the main ion flow shear, or equivalently, an effective flow shear, which combines main ion and impurity flow shears. Impurities can have a stabilising or destabilising role, depending on the parameters, and in particular the direction of main flow shear against impurity flow shear. Assuming a reasonable value of perpendicular wavenumber, the maximum growth rate is estimated, depending on impurity mass, charge, and concentration.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

      <title>A novel understanding of the role of plasma-molecular kinetics on divertor power exhaust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During detachment, a buffer of neutral atoms and molecules builds up between the target and the ionising plasma. Collisions between the plasma and the molecules play an important role in the detachment process. Studies of plasma-molecular kinetics indicate that the gas temperature is increased during detachment for a wide range of conditions on the MAST-U and TCV tokamaks. This is related to an increased $\mathrm{D}_2$ lifetime during detachment, leading to more plasma-molecule collisions that raise the molecular temperature. Such collisions subsequently result in significant power and momentum losses to the divertor plasma during detachment. Using a simplified inference, these losses are estimated using the rotational temperature, neutral pressure and ionisation front position. Significant power losses (about $10\%$ of $P_{SOL}$) and dominant momentum losses (majority of the upstream pressure) from plasma-molecule collisions are inferred experimentally in long-legged, strongly baffled, detached divertors (MAST-U Super-X divertor), consistent with SOLPS-ITER simulations. The vibrational distribution obtained is compared with an Eirene-like collisional-radiative model setup, indicating some qualitative agreements and disagreements, potentially highlighting model gaps.
  These interpretations highlight the importance of plasma-molecular collisions, leading to power and momentum losses during detachment. Our analysis and reduced modelling of these processes provide further insights into detachment control observations, the workings of long-legged divertors and divertor power balance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a laser- or particle beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator operates in the linear or moderately nonlinear regime, injecting an externally produced particle bunch (witness) to be accelerated may encounter an alignment problem. Witness alignment tolerances can be relaxed by using a damper, an additional particle bunch produced by the same injector and propagating at a submillimeter distance ahead of the witness. If misaligned, the damper perturbs the wakefield in such a way that the witness shifts on-axis with no quality loss.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>
