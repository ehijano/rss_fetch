      <title>Comparative Analysis of Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has revolutionized computer vision, yet their effectiveness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN and ViT architectures across three critical medical imaging tasks: chest X-ray pneumonia detection, brain tumor classification, and skin cancer melanoma detection. We evaluated four state-of-the-art models - ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, and DeiT-Small - across datasets totaling 8,469 medical images. Our results demonstrate task-specific model advantages: ResNet-50 achieved 98.37% accuracy on chest X-ray classification, DeiT-Small excelled at brain tumor detection with 92.16% accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 led skin cancer classification at 81.84% accuracy. These findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting architectures for medical AI applications, highlighting the importance of task-specific architecture selection in clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Querying GI Endoscopy Images: A VQA Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VQA (Visual Question Answering) combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with image understanding to answer questions about a given image. It has enormous potential for the development of medical diagnostic AI systems. Such a system can help clinicians diagnose gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accurately and efficiently. Although many of the multimodal LLMs available today have excellent VQA capabilities in the general domain, they perform very poorly for VQA tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging. This study is a submission for ImageCLEFmed-MEDVQA-GI 2025 subtask 1 that explores the adaptation of the Florence2 model to answer medical visual questions on GI endoscopy images. We also evaluate the model performance using standard metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and METEOR</description>

      <title>ST-DAI: Single-shot 2.5D Spatial Transcriptomics with Intra-Sample Domain Adaptive Imputation for Cost-efficient 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden.</description>

      <title>Control Copy-Paste: Controllable Diffusion-Based Augmentation Method for Remote Sensing Few-Shot Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) for optical remote sensing images aims to detect rare objects with only a few annotated bounding boxes. The limited training data makes it difficult to represent the data distribution of realistic remote sensing scenes, which results in the notorious overfitting problem. Current researchers have begun to enhance the diversity of few-shot novel instances by leveraging diffusion models to solve the overfitting problem. However, naively increasing the diversity of objects is insufficient, as surrounding contexts also play a crucial role in object detection, and in cases where the object diversity is sufficient, the detector tends to overfit to monotonous contexts. Accordingly, we propose Control Copy-Paste, a controllable diffusion-based method to enhance the performance of FSOD by leveraging diverse contextual information. Specifically, we seamlessly inject a few-shot novel objects into images with diverse contexts by a conditional diffusion model. We also develop an orientation alignment strategy to mitigate the integration distortion caused by varying aspect ratios of instances. Experiments on the public DIOR dataset demonstrate that our method can improve detection performance by an average of 10.76%.</description>

      <title>VidFuncta: Towards Generalizable Neural Representations for Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned 1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our code is publicly available under https://github.com/JuliaWolleb/VidFuncta_public.</description>

      <title>Cyst-X: AI-Powered Pancreatic Cancer Risk Prediction from Multicenter MRI in Centralized and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data, leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and 738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models (AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.</description>

      <title>Cardiac-CLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for 3D Cardiac CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain. However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ReXGroundingCT: A 3D Chest CT Dataset for Segmentation of Findings from Free-Text Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex, descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142 non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists. Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal. The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding, while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXGroundingCT.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving AI for Encrypted Medical Imaging: A Framework for Secure Diagnosis and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network (Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility, offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.</description>

      <title>OCSVM-Guided Representation Learning for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large, hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small, non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world medical imaging applications.

      <title>PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature, the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a 5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental imaging.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sub-pixel Motion Compensation in Learned Video Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs (HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel.

      <title>G$^{2}$SF-MIAD: Geometry-Guided Score Fusion for Multimodal Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Industrial quality inspection plays a critical role in modern manufacturing by identifying defective products during production. While single-modality approaches using either 3D point clouds or 2D RGB images suffer from information incompleteness, multimodal anomaly detection offers promise through the complementary fusion of crossmodal data. However, existing methods face challenges in effectively integrating unimodal results and improving discriminative power. To address these limitations, we first reinterpret memory bank-based anomaly scores in single modalities as isotropic Euclidean distances in local feature spaces. Dynamically evolving from Euclidean metrics, we propose a novel \underline{G}eometry-\underline{G}uided \underline{S}core \underline{F}usion (G$^{2}$SF) framework that progressively learns an anisotropic local distance metric as a unified score for the fusion task. Through a geometric encoding operator, a novel Local Scale Prediction Network (LSPN) is proposed to predict direction-aware scaling factors that characterize first-order local feature distributions, thereby enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. Additionally, we develop specialized loss functions and score aggregation strategy from geometric priors to ensure both metric generalization and efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MVTec-3D AD and Eyecandies datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art detection performance of our method, and detailed ablation analysis validates each component's contribution.

      <title>SurgiSR4K: A High-Resolution Endoscopic Video Dataset for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Image Similarity as a Metric for Augmenting Small Dataset Retinal Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</description>

      <title>Very High-Resolution Bridge Deformation Monitoring Using UAV-based Photogrammetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient structural health monitoring of infrastructure objects such as bridges is a vital task, as many existing constructions have already reached or are approaching their planned service life. In this contribution, we address the question of the suitability of UAV-based monitoring for SHM, in particular focusing on the geometric deformation under load. Such an advanced technology is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to decrease the cost and risk of tedious traditional inspection methods. To this end, we performed extensive tests employing a research reinforced concrete bridge that can be exposed to a predefined load via ground anchors. Very high-resolution image blocks have been captured before, during, and after the application of controlled loads. From those images, the motion of distinct points on the bridge has been monitored, and in addition, dense image point clouds were computed to evaluate the performance of surface-based data acquisition. Moreover, a geodetic control network in stable regions is used as control information for bundle adjustment. We applied different sensing technologies in order to be able to judge the image-based deformation results: displacement transducers, tachymetry, and laser profiling. As a platform for the photogrammetric measurements, a multi-rotor UAV DJI Matrice 600 Pro was employed, equipped with two RTK-GNSS receivers. The mounted camera was a PhaseOne iXM-100 (100MP) with an 80 mm lens. With a flying height of 30 m above the terrain, this resulted in a GSD of 1.3 mm while a forward and sideward overlap of 80% was maintained. The comparison with reference data (displacement transducers) reveals a difference of less than 1 mm. We show that by employing the introduced UAV-based monitoring approach, a full area-wide quantification of deformation is possible in contrast to classical point or profile measurements.</description>

      <title>V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.</description>
