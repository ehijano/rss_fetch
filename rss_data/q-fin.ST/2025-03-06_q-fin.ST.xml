      <title>Large language models in finance: estimating financial sentiment for stock prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis has become a central tool in market forecasting, with an increasing number of academic studies incorporating sentiment measures into financial prediction models. I investigate the origins and use of sentiment measures in finance, tracing their evolution from market-based and lexicon-based approaches to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of large language models has significantly improved the accuracy and depth of sentiment estimation. I examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, are more effective for financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective advantages in algorithmic trading, investor sentiment analysis, and financial decision-making. Hybrid approaches that combine classification and generative capabilities enhance predictive performance in sentiment-driven trading strategies. Findings underscore the increasing role of LLMs in financial sentiment analysis, enabling more nuanced, context-aware sentiment extraction from financial news, earnings reports, and social media data.</description>

      <title>Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. It uses the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The returns data are scaled by the estimated quantile series, then resampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. The proposed method is applicable to any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES does not change over time and can be extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models. Its finite sample properties, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</description>
