      <title>Transforming Object-Centric Event Logs to Temporal Event Knowledge Graphs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event logs play a fundamental role in enabling data-driven business process analysis. Traditionally, these logs track events related to a single object, known as the case, limiting the scope of analysis. Recent advancements, such as Object-Centric Event Logs (OCEL) and Event Knowledge Graphs (EKG), capture better how events relate to multiple objects. However, attributes of objects can change over time, which was not initially considered in OCEL or EKG. While OCEL 2.0 has addressed some of these limitations, there remains a research gap concerning how attribute changes should be accommodated in EKG and how OCEL 2.0 logs can be transformed into EKG. This paper fills this gap by introducing Temporal Event Knowledge Graphs (tEKG) and defining an algorithm to convert an OCEL 2.0 log to a tEKG.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Conjunctive Query Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Join evaluation is one of the most fundamental operations performed by database systems and arguably the most well-studied problem in the Database community. A staggering number of join algorithms have been developed, and commercial database engines use finely tuned join heuristics that take into account many factors including the selectivity of predicates, memory, IO, etc. However, most of the results have catered to either full join queries or non-full join queries but with degree constraints (such as PK-FK relationships) that make joins \emph{easier} to evaluate. Further, most of the algorithms are also not output-sensitive.
  In this paper, we present a novel, output-sensitive algorithm for the evaluation of acyclic Conjunctive Queries (CQs) that contain arbitrary free variables. Our result is based on a novel generalization of the Yannakakis algorithm and shows that it is possible to improve the running time guarantee of the Yannakakis algorithm by a polynomial factor. Importantly, our algorithmic improvement does not depend on the use of fast matrix multiplication, as a recently proposed algorithm does. The upper bound is complemented with matching lower bounds conditioned on two variants of the $k$-clique conjecture. The application of our algorithm recovers known prior results and improves on known state-of-the-art results for common queries such as paths and stars.</description>

      <title>Personalized Product Assortment with Real-time 3D Perception and Bayesian Payoff Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Product assortment selection is a critical challenge facing physical retailers. Effectively aligning inventory with the preferences of shoppers can increase sales and decrease out-of-stocks. However, in real-world settings the problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of product assortment possibilities. Consumer preferences are typically heterogeneous across space and time, making inventory-preference alignment challenging. Additionally, existing strategies rely on syndicated data, which tends to be aggregated, low resolution, and suffer from high latency. To solve these challenges we introduce a real-time recommendation system, which we call \ours. Our system utilizes recent advances in 3D computer vision for perception and automatic, fine grained sales estimation. These perceptual components run on the edge of the network and facilitate real-time reward signals. Additionally, we develop a Bayesian payoff model to account for noisy estimates from 3D LIDAR data. We rely on spatial clustering to allow the system to adapt to heterogeneous consumer preferences, and a graph-based candidate generation algorithm to address the combinatorial search problem. We test our system in real-world stores across two, 6-8 week A/B tests with beverage products and demonstrate a 35% and 27\% increase in sales respectively. Finally, we monitor the deployed system for a period of 28 weeks with an observational study and show a 9.4\% increase in sales.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Database Interfaces: A Survey of LLM-based Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating accurate SQL according to natural language questions (text-to-SQL) is a long-standing problem since it is challenging in user question understanding, database schema comprehension, and SQL generation. Conventional text-to-SQL systems include human engineering and deep neural networks. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed and utilized for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising performance. As modern databases become more complex and corresponding user questions more challenging, PLMs with limited comprehension capabilities can lead to incorrect SQL generation. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which, in turn, restricts the applications of PLM-based systems. Most recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant abilities in natural language understanding as the model scale remains increasing. Therefore, integrating the LLM-based implementation can bring unique opportunities, challenges, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of LLM-based text-to-SQL. Specifically, we propose a brief overview of the current challenges and the evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Then, we provide a detailed introduction to the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. After that, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges in this field and propose expectations for future directions.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Unravelling Local Government Data Sharing Barriers in Estonia and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estonia's digital government success has received global acclaim, yet its Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives, especially at the local level, encounter persistent challenges. Despite significant progress of national OGD initiative in OGD rankings, local governments lag in OGD provision. This study aims to examine barriers hindering municipalities from openly sharing OGD. Employing a qualitative approach through interviews with Estonian municipalities and drawing on the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model, the study sheds light on barriers impeding OGD sharing. Practical recommendations are proposed to bridge the gap between national policies and local implementation, including enhancing awareness, improving data governance frameworks, and fostering collaboration be-tween local and national authorities. By addressing overlooked weaknesses in the Estonian open data ecosystem and providing actionable recommendations, this research contributes to a more resilient and sustainable open data ecosystem. Additionally, by validating the OGD-adapted Innovation Resistance Theory model and proposing a revised version tailored for local government contexts, the study advances theoretical frameworks for understanding data sharing resistance. Ultimately, this study serves as a call to action for policymakers and practitioners to prioritize local OGD initiatives.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy.
  Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Private Search with Wally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Wally, a private search system that supports efficient semantic and keyword search queries against large databases. When sufficient clients are making the queries, Wally performance is significantly better than previous systems. In previous private search systems, for each client query, the server must perform at least one expensive cryptographic operation per database entry. As a result, performance degraded proportionally with the number of entries in the database. In Wally we get rid of this limitation. Specifically, for each query the server performs cryptographic operations only against a few database entries. We achieve these results by requiring each client to add a few fake queries, and sends each query via an anonymous network to the server at independently chosen random instants. Additionally, each client also uses somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) to hide whether a query is real or fake, Wally provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, which is an accepted standard for strong privacy. The number of fake queries each client makes depends inversely on the number of clients making queries. Therefore, the fake queries' overhead vanishes as the number of clients increases, enabling scalability to millions of queries and large databases. Concretely, Wally can serve $8$M requests at a rate of 3,000 queries per second. That is around 60x higher than the state-of-the-art scheme.</description>
