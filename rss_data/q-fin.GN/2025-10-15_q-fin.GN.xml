      <title>Proofs for the New Definitions in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to present proofs for new theorems. Basic thoughts of new definitions emerge from the decision-making under uncertainty in economics and finance. Shape of the certain utility curve is central to standard definitions in determining risk attitudes of investors. Shape alone determines risk behavior of investors in standard theory. Although the terms risk-averse, risk-loving, and risk-neutral are equivalent to strict concavity, strict convexity, and linearity, respectively, in standard theory, strict concavity or strict convexity, or linearity are valid for certain new definitions. The connection between the curvature of utility curve and risk attitude is broken for the new definitions. For instance, convex utility curve may show risk-averse behavior under new definitions. Additionally, this paper has proved that new definitions are richer than standard ones when shape is considered. Hence, it can be stated that new definitions are broader than standard definitions from the viewpoint of shape. With all of these, it has been demonstrated that the theorems and proofs in this study extend the standard utility theory in an important way.</description>

      <title>Mechanism design and equilibrium analysis of smart contract mediated resource allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in complex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc heuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous economic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart contract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and fairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and uniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism design, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable convergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate performance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept real-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee volatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case study illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in realistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while remaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond steady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy relevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource allocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable coordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with empirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only as technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency, accountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.</description>
