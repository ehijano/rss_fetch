      <title>Reproducing Standard Model Fermion Masses and Mixing in String Theory: A Heterotic Line Bundle Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving the Yukawa couplings and the resulting fermion masses and mixing angles of the Standard Model (SM) from a more fundamental theory remains one of the central outstanding problems in theoretical high-energy physics. It has long been recognised that string theory provides a framework within which this question can, at least in principle, be addressed. While substantial progress has been made in studying flavour physics in string compactifications over the past few decades, a concrete string construction that reproduces the full set of observed SM flavour parameters remains unknown. Here, we take a significant step in this direction by identifying two explicit $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string models compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold with abelian, holomorphic, and poly-stable vector bundles with an (MS)SM spectrum. Subject to reasonable assumptions about the moduli, we show that these models reproduce the correct values of the quark and charged lepton masses, as well as the quark mixing parameters, at some point in their moduli spaces. The resulting four-dimensional theories are $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric, contain no exotic fields and realise a $\mu$-term suppressed to the electroweak scale. While the issues of moduli stabilisation and supersymmetry breaking are not addressed here, our main result constitutes a proof of principle: there exist choices of topology and moduli within heterotic string compactifications which allow for an MSSM spectrum with the correct flavour parameters.</description>

      <title>Carroll theories from Lorentzian light-cone theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive Carrollian field theories via null reduction from Lorentzian light-cone actions in Minkowski spacetime. By suitably deforming the light-cone action, we reduce the Poincar\'e invariance to a Bargmann subgroup, from which both magnetic and electric Carroll actions can be obtained in one lower dimension. Through a canonical analysis, we show that the second-class constraints usually found in Lorentzian light-cone theories are absent for these deformed Bargmann-invariant actions. We demonstrate the procedure for theories with and without gauge symmetry. Notably, while the magnetic Carroll sector can be directly derived from the original Lorentzian action, the deformation is essential to obtain the electric Carroll sector. We further argue that magnetic Carroll solutions in $d$ dimensions represent a consistent truncation of the solutions of the $(d+1)$-dimensional Lorentzian parent theory, providing an effective description of light-cone dynamics near a null hypersurface. For gauge theories, we also highlight the role of the light-cone gauge condition in deriving Carrollian theories.</description>

      <title>An Open System Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime.
  As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <title>Charged Dirac fermions with anomalous magnetic moment in the presence of the chiral magnetic effect and of a noncommutative phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the relativistic energy spectrum (or relativistic Landau levels) for charged Dirac fermions with anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) in the presence of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) and of a noncommutative (NC) phase space, where we work with the Dirac equation in cylindrical coordinates. Using a similarity transformation, we obtain four coupled first-order differential equations. Subsequently, obtain four non-homogeneous second-order differential equations. To solve these equations exactly and analytically, we use a change of variable, the asymptotic behavior, and the Frobenius method. Consequently, we obtain the relativistic spectrum for the electron/positron, where we note that this spectrum is quantized in terms of the radial and angular quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the position and momentum NC parameters $\theta$ and $\eta$ (describes the NC phase space), cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ (an angular frequency that depends on the electric charge $e$, mass $m$, and external magnetic field $B$), anomalous magnetic energy $E_m$ (an energy generated through the interaction of the AMM with the external magnetic field), $z$-momentum $k_z$ (linear momentum along the $z$-axis), and on the fermion and chiral chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_5$ (describes the CME). However, through $\theta$, $\eta$, and $m$, we define two types of ''NC angular frequencies'', given by $\omega_\theta=4/m\theta$ and $\omega_\eta=\eta/m$ (i.e., our spectrum depends on three angular frequencies). Comparing our spectrum with other papers, we verified that it generalizes several particular cases in the literature. Besides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum as a function of $B$, $\mu$, $\mu_5$, $k_z$, $\theta$, and $\eta$ for three different values of $n$ and $m_j$.</description>

      <title>Topological gravity for arbitrary Dyson index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the well established duality of topological gravity to a double scaled matrix model with the Airy spectral curve to define what we refer to as topological gravity with arbitrary Dyson index $\upbeta$ ($\upbeta$ topological gravity). On the matrix model side this is an interpolation in the Dyson index between the Wigner-Dyson classes, on the gravity side it can be thought of as interpolating between orientable and unorientable manifolds in the gravitational path integral, opening up the possibility to study moduli space volumes of manifolds ``in between''. Using the perturbative loop equations we study correlation functions of this theory and prove several structural properties, having clear implications on the generalised moduli space volumes. Additionally we give a geometric interpretation of these properties using the generalisation to arbitrary Dyson index of the recently found Mirzakhani-like recursion for unorientable surfaces. Using these properties, we investigate whether $\upbeta$-topological gravity is quantum chaotic in the sense of the BGS conjecture. Along the way we answer this question for the last Wigner-Dyson class not studied in the literature, the symplectic one, and establish strong evidence for quantum chaos for this variety of the theory, and thus for all bosonic varieties of topological gravity. For the general $\upbeta$ case we also argue for the case of quantum chaoticity, based on novel constraints we find to be obeyed by genuinely non Wigner-Dyson parts of the moduli space volumes. As for the general $\upbeta$ case the universal behaviour expected from a chaotic system is not known analytically we give first steps how to obtain it, starting with the result of $\upbeta$ topological gravity and comparing then to a numerical evaluation of the universal result.</description>

      <title>Soft breaking of translational symmetry in the $\phi^4$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional scalar field theory that modifies the standard $\phi^4$ model by introducing a smooth breaking of translational invariance through a hyperbolic generalizing function. This function explicitly breaks the $\mathds{Z}_2$ symmetry; however, it also introduces a mechanism capable of generating new energy minima (vacua) and of localizing or delocalizing field fluctuations around these vacua. Thus, this mechanism enables a continuous transformation of kink/antikink-like structures into compacted asymmetric double-kink/antikink. Accordingly, this transformation gives rise to new classes of configurations resembling asymmetric non-topological soliton, characterized by a soft breaking of translational symmetry due to the violation of $\mathds{Z}_2$ symmetry. These findings are particularly compelling, as they are consistent with results describing Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) domain walls in dimerized polymer systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>

      <title>The tensor multiplet in loop space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the abelian tensor multiplet on a curved spacetime with at least two supercharges in a cohomological form where all the bosonic and fermionic fields become tensor fields. These tensor fields are rewritten as fields in loop space by a transgression map. There are two lightlike conformal Killing vectors. By decomposing the spacetime tensor fields in transverse and parallel components to these Killing vectors, we obtain the equations of motion in loop space by closing the supersymmetry variations on-shell. We generalize to nonabelian gauge groups. By closing supersymmetry variations we obtain nonabelian fermionic equations of motion in loop space.</description>

      <title>Chiral Integrable Boundary States in the SU(4) Alternating Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously identified integrable boundary states in ABJM theory are exclusively achiral. This paper presents the first chiral integrable boundary states in the $SU(4)$ alternating spin chain from the planar two-loop dilatation operator in the scalar sector. Utilizing a sufficient condition for the untwisted integrable condition, we identify specific two-site and four-site basis boundary states as chiral integrable states. Numerical evidence indicates that other basis states are unlikely to be chiral integrable. Furthermore, we compute the overlaps between these chiral integrable basis states and on-shell Bethe eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features from heavy particle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the IIA supergravity solutions corresponding to a warped product of a 3D external Minkowski space and a 7D internal non-compact space, with the latter being the direct product of a deformed conifold and a circle. The specific construction allows for the presence of either a finite 4-cycle or a 3-cycle at the tip supported by the $F_4$ or the $H_3$ flux respectively. Once we mod-out by a $Z_2$ involution we can also get a G2 space, and for completeness we also report on some basic features that we expect from the embedding in a compact setup.</description>

      <title>Do Anomalies Break Momentum Routing Invariance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagrammatic computation of the chiral anomaly is associated with momentum-routing invariance breaking. This happens because the momentum routing in the internal lines of a loop diagram is chosen such that the gauge Ward identities hold and the chiral Ward identity is broken by the finite term measured in the pion decay into two photons. Since the latter is observable, it seems that there is a preferred momentum routing set by experiments. However, it is shown in this work that the chiral anomaly is momentum-routing invariant. This idea is specially important for situations in which there are no experiments yet to decide on the momentum routing, like in supersymmetric theories and in frameworks with CPT and Lorentz violation. Therefore, we resort to momentum-routing invariance to find out what symmetry is broken in a nonminimal CPT- and Lorentz-violating version of quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Transforming Calabi-Yau Constructions: Generating New Calabi-Yau Manifolds with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine, regular, and star triangulations (FRSTs) of four-dimensional reflexive polytopes give rise to toric varieties, within which generic anticanonical hypersurfaces yield smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds. We employ transformers -- deep learning models originally developed for language modeling -- to generate FRSTs across a range of polytope sizes. Our models exhibit efficient and unbiased sampling, and can self-improve through retraining on their own output. These results lay the foundation for AICY: a community-driven platform that combines self-improving machine learning models with a continuously expanding FRST database to explore and catalog the Calabi-Yau landscape.</description>

      <title>Confinement/deconfinement at low temperatures and rotation in the exact soft wall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of rotation on the confinement/deconfinement phase transition of strongly interacting matter, at low temperatures, in the soft wall AdS/QCD model at finite density. To achieve it, we apply the Hawking-Page approach to the exact Andreev's solution of a charged rotating black hole in five-dimensional AdS space. We observe that there is a most critical angular velocity ($\omega_0$) of hadronic matter that depends on the baryon density, representing a strong constraint on the rotation in hadronic matter. We obtain the curve $\omega_0(\mu)$, which shows that the critical rotational velocity allowed for hadronic matter decreases as the chemical potential ($\mu$) increases. When $\mu$ approaches the most critical quark chemical potential, identified as the density of a phase transition at zero temperature for a non-rotating plasma, the rotational velocity allowed for the hadrons tends to zero. If $\omega \geq \omega_0 $, there is no phase transition and the QCD matter remains in the deconfined plasma phase. The QCD phase diagram is also obtained for the exact solution, and the critical temperatures are compared with the ones obtained from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om approximation.</description>

Abstract: Extremal and near extremal black holes are unstable, unless they are protected by supersymmetry. For black holes in AdS$_3 \times S^3$, we study the range of parameters that bound the unstable region, the fate of extremal black holes that are unstable, and the true ground state in super-selection sectors where no isolated black hole solution exists. Thermodynamics generally favors a central black hole surrounded by chiral primaries that carry a significant fraction of the conserved charges. We give a dynamical interpretation of decay, by computing the linear response functions in the dual CFT$_2$ and showing that the onset of instability agrees with thermodynamics. To understand the nature of the decay products, we construct several new families of classical string solutions. They are ``giants" that move on both the AdS$_3$ and the $S^3$, and may have interesting applications beyond those we develop.</description>

      <title>Self-Tracking Solutions for Asymptotic Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of pure scalar fields rolling on an exponential potential in the absence of any additional background fluid and demonstrate the existence of self-tracking solutions in which the self-perturbations of the scalar field act as an effective radiation background. The validity of these solutions is demonstrated through both analytic techniques and numerical simulations using CosmoLattice. We discuss applications to string cosmologies with significant trans-Planckian field excursions between inflation and BBN, including the required initial level of scalar perturbations to avoid overshoot.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients and quasinormal modes in Einstein-dilaton holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transport coefficients of a strongly coupled plasma in the context of holographic QCD models based on Einstein-dilaton gravity that are compatible with linear confinement at zero temperature. At finite temperature, the holographic model is characterized by an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole coupled to a scalar field, the dilaton, which is quadratic in the radial direction. The inclusion of the scalar field results in an explicit breaking of the conformal symmetry in the dual field theory. In such systems, the Hawking temperature of the black hole corresponds to the plasma temperature in the dual field theory. We confirm the existence of a minimum temperature $T_{\min}$, above which two distinct classes of black hole solutions emerge: one corresponding to large black holes and the other to small black holes. We calculate some thermodynamic quantities -- such as entropy, specific heat, and speed of sound -- and find results that are consistent with similar holographic models. We calculate the quasinormal modes (QNM) of the tensor and vector sectors using the pseudospectral method. In the hydrodynamic regime, we derive the dispersion relation for the vector sector, from which we extract the shear viscosity and the ratio $\eta/s=1/4 \pi$. The bulk viscosity is calculated using the Kubo formula in the scalar sector. Finally, our results for the speed of sound are compared with the Lattice QCD predictions, and our results for the bulk viscosity are compared with those reported by the JETSCAPE collaboration.</description>

      <title>A partially broken Fronsdal model for massless higher-spin particles of integer spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing arbitrary parameters in the usual Fronsdal model, we find a region in the parameters space away from the ``Fronsdal point'' where we still have an irreducible description of massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The higher spin gauge symmetry is further constrained by a vanishing double divergence condition on the traceless gauge parameter: $\partial\cdot\partial\cdot\bar\Lambda=0$. Remarkably, it does not introduce extra propagating gauge invariants. We demonstrate that we only have $\pm s$ helicity states as propagating modes for arbitrary integer $s\ge 3$. For the simplest $s=3$ case we present a gauge invariant proof while for $s\ge 4$ we use a light-cone gauge. The reduction in the gauge symmetry allows for more general source couplings when compared to the Fronsdal model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Temporal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified theoretical framework, Measurement-Induced Temporal Geometry (MTG), in which time, causality, and spacetime geometry emerge from quantum measurement acting on a fiber-valued internal time field. Each spacetime point supports a local degree of freedom $\tau$, modeled as a smooth section of a fiber bundle $\pi: E \to M$, with projection events $\mu[\tau]$ generating classical temporal flow. Quantum coherence and entanglement are encoded in the curvature $F = \nabla^2$ of a connection on the time-fiber, while the effective spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ arises as an integral over measurement histories. We derive the dynamical equations governing $\tau$, its supersymmetric completions, and the entanglement connection $A_\mu$, showing how quantization proceeds via both canonical and path-integral methods. Standard Model fields couple covariantly to the fiber geometry, and gravitational dynamics emerge from variational principles over projection-induced entropy. Cosmological inflation, dark energy, and large-scale structure are reinterpreted as consequences of modular coherence, topological obstruction, and fluctuations in the projection density $\rho(x)$. Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, MTG reinterprets modular Hamiltonians as boundary projections of bulk time flow and identifies entanglement wedges with surfaces minimizing measurement-induced projection current. A UV-complete embedding arises through string theory, where $\tau$ descends from compactified moduli and projection corresponds to brane interaction and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The framework yields a set of falsifiable predictions, including CMB anisotropies, black hole ringdown echoes, and modular deviations in lab-scale quantum systems, offering a consistent and testable account of spacetime as an emergent property of quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>The Domain Wall String's Anti-Stokes Scattering Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider anti-Stokes scattering, in which a perturbative meson scatters off of a domain wall string's shape mode excitation, de-exciting it. Previously the probability of this process was calculated for a perpendicular incident meson striking the center of a localized shape mode. The answer depended on the profiles of the initial wave packets. In this paper we consider an arbitrary incident angle and impact parameter. In addition to the de-excitation probability, we compute the cross section for this process, which as usual is independent of the details of the wave packets. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a cross section has been defined for the scattering of a bulk degree of freedom with a localized excitation in an extended soliton.</description>

      <title>Quantum noncommutative ABJM field theory: four- and six-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous paper Quantum noncommutative ABJM theory: first steps, JHEP {\bf 1804} (2018) 070), in this article we investigate one-loop 1PI four-, and six-point functions by using the component formalism in the Landau gauge and show that they are UV finite and have well-defined $(\theta^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow 0)$ limit. Those results also hold for all one-loop functions which are UV finite by power counting. In summary, taking into account results from previous paper, JHEP {\bf 1804} (2018) 070), and this paper, we conclude that, at least at one-loop order, the NCABJM theory is free from the noncommutative UV and IR instabilities, and that in the limit $\theta^{\mu\nu}\rightarrow 0$ it flows to the ordinary ABJM theory.</description>

      <title>Blowing-up the edge: connection formulae and stability chart of the Lam\'e equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic spectral problems through their connection with supersymmetric gauge theories and two-dimensional conformal field theory. To characterize the associated stability chart, we develop a novel and systematic approach for analyzing semi-classical Virasoro blocks near their poles. Via the AGT correspondence, these blocks correspond to SU(2) Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, which we propose to resum using an appropriate limit of blow-up equations. We show that the analytic structure of the resulting resummed partition functions features branch cuts located precisely at the edges between bands and gaps in the spectrum of the associated quantum integrable system with periodic potential. We examine the Nekrasov partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with $N_f \le 4$ flavors and of the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory, which are related to the Heun equation, its confluent forms, and the Lam\'e equation. In the latter case, we analyze the spectrum in detail and solve the associated connection problem. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained via isomonodromic deformation techniques and the computation of orbifold surface defect partition functions in the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ gauge theory, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Seiberg-like duality of adjoint SQCD(Kim-Park duality) with linear monopole superpotential terms which encompasses known monopole deformed Kim-Park dualities. Equipped with this, we classify all the monopole deformed Kim--Park dualities up to quadratic powers of monopole deformations, and find all are equivalent either to the original Kim--Park, or to the proposed duality. With the recently developed deconfined perspective, this means all the working monopole deformed Kim--Park dualities up to quadratic terms are assembled by the Aharony and Benini-Benvenuti-Pasquetti dualities.</description>

      <title>An exact solution of planar QCD by a complex matrix ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the planar QCD loop equation in four-dimensional Euclidean space using a novel matrix-valued momentum loop formalism. Central to this construction is a new loop calculus, where functional derivatives act on the loop velocity $\dot C(\theta)$. This framework yields finite, well-defined expressions for point and area derivatives in loop space and highlights the role of the loop-space Bianchi identity in ensuring consistency with gauge theory.
  The Wilson loop is represented as an average over matrix-valued momentum loops $P(\theta)$ tracing closed paths in a compact complex manifold constrained by self-duality and boundary conditions. These random walks are governed by a measure supported on such manifolds. The self-duality conditions ensure the vanishing of the classical Yang--Mills term in the loop equation, while additional constraints eliminate the contact terms in the planar ($N \to \infty$) limit.
  A key structural feature of the solution is its invariance under reflection--conjugation symmetry: reversing loop orientation and taking complex conjugation maps a solution to another. This holds for arbitrary compact Lie groups used in the momentum ensemble and is independent of the original SU($N$) gauge group.
  We conjecture that, in the classical limit, the matrix ensemble defines a generalized minimal surface embedded not in $\mathbb{R}^4$ but in a higher-dimensional matrix space. This (hypothetical) extended surface has self-dual area elements and satisfies the loop equation via geometry and the Bianchi identity.</description>

      <title>Neumann scalar determinants on constant curvature disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in the $\zeta$-function regularisation scheme, we find certain infinite series representations of the logarithms of massive scalar determinants, $\det(\Delta+m^{2})$ for arbitrary $m^2$, on finite round disks of constant curvature ($R=\frac{2\eta}{L^2}, \eta=0,\pm1$) with Neumann boundary conditions. The derivation of these representations relies on a relation between the Neumann determinants on the disks and the corresponding Dirichlet determinants via the determinants of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on the boundaries of the disks. We corroborate the results in an appendix by computing the Neumann determinants in an alternative way. In the cases of disks with nonzero curvatures, we show that the infinite series representations reduce to exact expressions for some specific values of $m^2$, viz. $m^2=-\frac{\eta}{L^2}q(q+1)$ with $q\in \mathbb{N}$. Our analysis uses and extends the results obtained in arXiv:2405.14958 for similar Dirichlet determinants on constant curvature disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of light-cone gauge vector superspace, a continuous-spin field propagating in AdS space of dimension greater than or equal to four is studied. Use of such framework allows us to find a simple solution for spin operators entering our light-cone gauge Lagrangian formulation. Bosonic continuous-spin field is considered in AdS space of arbitrary dimensions, while the use of a helicity basis in four-dimensional AdS space allows us to consider bosonic and fermionic continuous-spin fields on an equal footing. Classification of continuous-spin fields is proposed. Conjectures on the notion of masslessness for continuous-spin field are made. All unitary irreps of non-linear spin algebra for four-dimensional AdS are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Consistency relations bridging gravitational wave and large scale structure observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic waves (EMW) luminosity distances, the speed of gravitational waves (GW) and the sound speed. Inspired by the form of the CRs for no-brading and constant brading theories, we propose a generalized phenomenological consistency condition. We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Are gravitational waves consistent with other probes of gravity and dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20182v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window on the Universe, allowing to obtain constraints on dark energy and gravity independent from other electromagnetic waves observations, such as large scale structure (LSS). For the purpose of investigating the consistency between different observations the effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy is a useful tool, allowing to derive model and parametrization independent consistency relations (CR) between the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity (EM) distance, and the speed of GWs. We test the constant brading CR, which is also satisfied by general relativity, by comparing for the first time the constraints obtained from LSS observations with those from GW events with and without electromagnetic counterparts, confirming the validity of the CR at the current level of experimental uncertainty. The event GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart provides a constraint of the effective gravitational constant with an accuracy comparable with LSS constraints, while the analysis of GW events without electromagnetic counterpart are consistent, but do not have a constraining power comparable to LSS observations. Beside allowing to test the consistency between independent observations, the CRs can be used to estimate the effective gravitational coupling with GWs at high redshift, where other observations are not available.</description>

      <title>Inflationary magnetogenesis beyond slow-roll and its induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic fields observed on both astrophysical and cosmological scales is a compelling problem that has the potential to shed light on the early Universe. We analytically investigate inflationary magnetogenesis in scenarios where a brief departure from slow-roll inflation - akin to mechanisms proposed for primordial black hole formation - leads to enhanced magnetic field generation with a growing power spectrum. Focusing on the Ratra model, we derive an analytic bound on the growth of the magnetic field power spectrum in this context, showing that the spectral index can reach $d \ln {\cal P}_B / d \ln k = 4.75$ during the growth phase. This growth enables amplification from CMB-safe large-scale amplitudes to values of astrophysical relevance. We further compute the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by the resulting magnetic fields, incorporating their rich spectral features. Under suitable conditions, the induced signal exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence and amplitude within reach of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a distinctive signature of this mechanism and a specific class of templates for upcoming gravitational wave searches.</description>

      <title>Twisted echoes of an odd quartet: Scalar-induced gravitational waves as a probe of primordial parity-violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.</description>

      <title>Cornering Natural SUSY at a Tera-$Z$ Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future circular $e^+ e^-$ collider (FCC-ee) stands out as the next flagship project in particle physics, dedicated to uncovering the microscopic origin of the Higgs boson. In this context, we assess indirect probes of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), a well-established benchmark hypothesis, exploring the complementarity between Higgs measurements and electroweak precision tests at the $Z$-pole. We study three key sectors: the heavy Higgs doublet, scalar top partners, and light gauginos and higgsinos, focusing on the parameter space favored by naturalness. Remarkably, the Tera-$Z$ program consistently offers significantly greater indirect sensitivity than the Mega-$h$ run. While promising, these prospects hinge on reducing SM uncertainties. Accordingly, we highlight key precision observables for targeted theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Lower bound on the proper lengths of stationary bound-state charged massive scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed that charged scalar clouds, spatially regular matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields, can be supported by spinning and charged Kerr-Newman black holes. Using analytical techniques, we establish a no-short hair theorem for these stationary bound-state field configurations. In particular, we prove that the effective proper lengths of the supported charged massive scalar clouds are bounded from below by the remarkably compact dimensionless relation $\ell/M&gt;\ln(3+\sqrt{8})$, where $M$ is the mass of the central supporting black hole. Intriguingly, this lower bound is universal in the sense that it is valid for all Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetimes [that is, in the entire regime $\{a/M\in(0,1],Q/M\in[0,1)\}$ of the dimensionless spin and charge parameters that characterize the central supporting black holes] and for all values of the physical parameters (electric charge $q$, proper mass $\mu$, and angular harmonic indexes $\{l,m\}$) that characterize the supported stationary bound-state scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of future trapping horizons through the dynamics of the Misner-Sharp mass using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. Our analysis shows that an integral formulation of Hayward's first law governs much of the evolution of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. To account for the accretion backreaction, we consider a near-horizon approximation, yielding first-order corrections of a Vaidya-dark energy form. We further propose a systematic perturbative scheme to study these effects for an arbitrary background. As an application, we analyze an accreting Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and demonstrate the horizon shifts that are produced. Finally, we compute accretion-induced corrections to an extremal configuration. It is shown that momentum influx and energy density produce distinct effects: the former forces the splitting of the extremal horizon, while the latter induces significant displacements in its position, computed up to first-order perturbative corrections. These results highlight how different components of the stress-energy tensor significantly affect horizon geometry, with potential implications for broader areas of research, including black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Goeritz matrices for computation of bipartite HOMFLY-PT polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goeritz matrix is an alternative to the Kauffman bracket and, in addition, makes it possible to calculate the Jones polynomial faster with some minimal choice of a checkerboard surface of a link diagram. We introduce a modification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for computing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of bipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices, and therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite links form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links constructed from the so-called rational tangles. We demonstrate how to obtain a bipartite diagram of such links and calculate the corresponding HOMFLY-PT polynomials using our developed generalized Goeritz method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstable states that live long enough may appear as in(out)going particles in scattering experiments. Yet, the standard QFT approach strictly applies only to fully stable asymptotic states. This is evident when scattering involving unstable particles develops a $t$-channel singularity at specific angles. We employ a finite-time formalism leading to analytic results without the singularity (even in the infinite-time limit), thus solving the problem at a fundamental level. In turn, the approach also justifies treating long-lived particles, like weakly decaying pions, as stable during strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals and extra dimensions: Insights from modified Teukolsky framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer a promising avenue to test extra-dimensional physics through gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising as extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework and compute observables, as well as compare the results with those from the standard Teukolsky formalism for general relativity (GR). Our analysis reveals significant deviations in dephasing and mismatch values, especially for the higher eccentricities. These findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also the necessity of using the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Stability and Criticality Behaviors of Accelerating Charged AdS Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.</description>

      <title>Cauchy Horizon (In)Stability of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common feature of regular black hole spacetimes is the presence of an inner Cauchy horizon. The analogy to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution then suggests that these geometries suffer from a mass-inflation effect, rendering the Cauchy horizon unstable. Recently, it was shown that this analogy fails for certain classes of regular black holes, including the Hayward solution, where the late-time behavior of the mass function no longer grows exponentially but follows a power law. In this work, we extend these results in a two-fold way. First, we determine the basin-of-attraction for the power-law attractor, showing that the tamed growth of the mass function is generic. Second, we extend the systematic analysis to the Bardeen geometry, the Dymnikova black hole, and a spacetime arising from a non-singular collapse model newly proposed in the context of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Remarkably, in the latter solution, the Misner-Sharp mass at the Cauchy horizon remains of the same order of magnitude of the mass of the black hole, since its growth is just logarithmic.</description>

      <title>Rotational susceptibility of a hot and dense hadronic matter: A possible probe of QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation and the consequent angular momentum fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The rotational susceptibilities ($\chi_{\rm \omega}$, $\chi^{2}_{\rm \omega}$, etc.), which quantify how much the system responds to a small angular velocity, are estimated for the first time, considering that these can be valuable indicators of the QCD phase transition. The higher-order rotational susceptibilities and their ratios are estimated in the presence and absence of baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\rm B}$) in the system. The effect of particle spin ($s$) and rotational chemical potential ($\omega$) on the fluctuation of the angular momentum is studied. To consider a more realistic scenario, the effect of interactions between hadrons is taken into account by considering van der Waals-like interactions, which include both attractive and repulsive interactions. A phase transition, absent in an ideal hadron gas model, can be observed in an interacting hadron gas model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of string phenomenology is to find realistic models of particle physics and cosmology within string theory. Dark bubble cosmology is an alternative to string compactifications, where our universe lives on a bubble expanding in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This construction is inherently non-supersymmetric and can yield a four-dimensional realistic cosmology, where radiation behaves as expected due to its coupling to higher-dimensional fields. We study the coupling of the electroweak and strong sectors to the induced braneworld gravity via the same mechanism. While the electroweak sector is unaffected, the gravitational and inertial masses of the proton differ significantly, severely violating measurements of the equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole Thermodynamics from Gauge Freedom in Extended Iyer-Wald Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic systems admit multiple equivalent descriptions related by transformations that preserve their fundamental structure. This work focuses on exact isohomogeneous transformations (EITs), a class of mappings that keep fixed the set of independent variables of the thermodynamic potential, while preserving both the original homogeneity and the validity of a first law. Our investigation explores EITs within the extended Iyer--Wald formalism for theories containing free parameters (e.g., the cosmological constant). EITs provide a unifying framework for reconciling the diverse formulations of Kerr-anti de Sitter (KadS) thermodynamics found in the literature. While the Iyer--Wald formalism is a powerful tool for deriving first laws for black holes, it typically yields a non-integrable mass variation that prevents its identification as a proper thermodynamic potential. To address this issue, we investigate an extended Iyer--Wald formalism where mass and thermodynamic volume become gauge dependent. Within this framework, we identify the gauge choices and Killing vector normalizations that are compatible with EITs, ensuring consistent first laws. As a key application, we demonstrate how conventional KadS thermodynamics emerges as a special case of our generalized approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective Schwarzschild metric in the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the detection of elusive black-hole features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed quantized defects in the bulk theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a sequel in which we derive and simplify the gravitational equations that apply in accelerating cosmological spacetimes.

      <title>Astrophysical Quantum Matter Revisited: Flat-Band Topological States on a Zero-Flux Dipole Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes, forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</description>

      <title>Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the throat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any particle passing through the throat is divergent.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Open Quantum Dynamics and Isomorphism to Superconformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincar\'e algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Towards a consistent Semiclassical Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity can be rendered consistent by assuming that quantum systems only emit a gravitational field when they interact with a stable determination chain (SDCs), which are specific chains of interactions modeled via decoherence and test functions obeying a set of conditions. When systems are disconnected from SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field. This denies the universality of gravity, while upholding a version of the equivalence principle. We argue that this theory can be tested by experiments that investigate the gravitational field emitted by isolated systems like in gravcats experiments or by investigating the gravitational interactions between entangled systems like in the (Bose-Marletto-Vedral) BMV experiment. Our theory fits into a new framework which holds that in the absence of certain conditions, quantum systems cannot emit a gravitational field. There are many possible conditions for systems to emit a gravitational field, and we will adopt a subset of them. We will show how this subset of conditions provides multiple benefits beyond rendering semiclassical gravity consistent, which includes deriving the value of the cosmological constant from first principles and providing an explanation for why the vacuum does not gravitate.</description>

Abstract: In this essay based on 0907.2939, we argue that the emergence of classically connected spacetimes is intimately related to the quantum entanglement of degrees of freedom in a non-perturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling the degrees of freedom associated with two regions of spacetime results in these regions pulling apart and pinching off from each other in a way that can be quantified by standard measures of entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized Levy-Leblond equation (GLL) is used to study the bound state problem for a non-relativistic Fermi field in external potentials. A condition when the rest energy term can be removed from the GLL equation is determined. For external potentials which do not obey the condition, the bound state spectrum is affected non-trivially by the rest energy of the Fermi field. This is demonstrated for a spherical finite-depth well potential. The existence, number, and energies of bound states depend on the value of the rest energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in four-dimensional charged Lifshitz-AdS black holes with scalar hair, within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) gravity. Using the improved asymptotic iteration method (AIM), we compute the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and explore their dependence on key parameters, including the Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$, the scalar field mass and charge, and the black hole charge, under various spatial curvature settings ($k=0, \pm1$). Our results reveal rich and sensitive behavior in both the real and imaginary parts of QNMs. In particular, the decay rates can exhibit monotonic or non-monotonic dependence on the black hole charge, depending on the values of $z$, $m_s$, and $q_s$. These findings highlight the significant role of field and geometric parameters in governing the dynamical stability of Lifshitz black holes and offer insights into the perturbative properties of non-AdS holographic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the (leading) 4-derivative corrections, including both parity even and odd terms, to electrically-charged Kerr-Newman black holes. The linear perturbative equations are then solved order by order in terms of two dimensionless rotating and charge parameters. The solution allows us to extract the multipole moments of mass and current from the metric as well as the electric and magnetic multipole moments from the Maxwell field. We find that all the multipole moments are invariant under the field redefinition, indicating they are well-defined physical observables in this effective theory approach to quantum gravity. We also find that parity-odd corrections can turn on the multipole moments that vanish in Einstein theory, which may have significant observational implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-construe unconventional supersymmetry, a notion introduced by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ), as an attempt to use the framework of supersymmetric field theory to describe fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields in a unified way, as parts of a single superconnection. It hinges upon the so-called matter ansatz. Unfortunately, the formal and conceptual status of the ansatz has remained unclear, preventing unconventional supersymmetry to be used in a principled way as a general approach beyond the model in which it was first considered. In this letter, we lift this restriction by showing that the ansatz is a special case of the Dressing Field Method, a new systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

Abstract: We study covariant open bosonic string field theory in lightcone gauge. When lightcone gauge is well-defined, we find two results. First, the vertices of the gauge-fixed action consist of Mandelstam diagrams with stubs covering specific portions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. This is true regardless of how the vertices of the original covariant string field theory are constructed (e.g. through minimal area metrics, hyperbolic geometry, and so on). Second, the portions of moduli space covered by gauge-fixed vertices are changed relative to those covered by the original covariant vertices. The extra portions are supplied through the exchange of longitudinal degrees of freedom in scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <title>The gravitational index of 5d black holes and black strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersymmetric index of 5d black strings and spinning black holes in M-theory is related to that of 4d black holes in type IIA supergravity when both theories are compactified on the same Calabi-Yau threefold. We find the finite-temperature saddles for the 5d gravitational supersymmetric index by uplifting the recently found attractor saddles of the corresponding 4d index. We study uplifts for two types of geometries: 5d black holes and 5d black strings. For 5d black holes, the uplift guarantees that the index of 4d and 5d black holes match. For 5d black strings, the saddle reproduces the microscopic index at leading order in $G_N$ , even without the conventional decoupling limit taken in AdS/CFT. In particular, when the temperature is set to be finite in the 5d flat space region, the black string index is computed from an asymptotically flat solution where the AdS throat is absent. Further, as the temperature is lowered and eventually becomes infinitesimally small in the flat space region, the solution admits a novel decoupling limit in which the AdS$_3$ throat takes the form of a finite-temperature BTZ black hole that is known to compute the index in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. This represents the first step towards understanding holography for supersymmetric observables in flat space, away from the decoupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ $Q$-systems: Twist and Open Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the line defect correlation functions decorating the supersymmetric indices of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the correlators by means of combinatorial methods associated with the group characters, including the generalized Murnaghan-Nakayama rules. The exact results for the large $N$ correlators lead to the gravity indices for the gravity dual spectrum of the fluctuations of the fundamental string wrapping $AdS_2$ and those of the fat string, the D5-brane wrapping $AdS_2$ $\times$ $\mathbb{RP}^4$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed backgrounds of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model based on the $H_{_{4}}$ Lie group can be considered as solutions of the generalized supergravity equations (GSEs). Then, by applying the Poisson-Lie T-duality in the presence of spectator fields, we obtain the non-Abelian target space duals of those models. It is shown that all dual models (except for one model) are integrable and most interestingly, they satisfy the GSEs. As a final remark, we show that all solutions of the GSEs for the original models are trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory can be identified as a mathematical object in $K$-theory and that its associated spectral flow is equal to the index. In comparison to the standard lattice Dirac operator index, our formulation does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and has broader applicability to systems with boundaries and to the mod-two version of the indices in general dimensions. We numerically verify that the $K$ and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in continuum theory. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional torus and, for the first time, demonstrate that the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index with nontrivial curved boundaries, as well as the mod-two versions, can be computed on a lattice.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in supersymmetric field theory is that supersymmetry transformations on field variables generally form an algebra only on-shell, i.e. upon imposing the field equations. We show that this issue is defused in a manifestly relational - and thus automatically invariant - formulation of supersymmetric field theory, achieved through the application of the Dressing Field Method of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Self-duality and the Holomorphic Ansatz in Generalized BPS Skyrme Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the BPS Skyrme model for simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. In such a theory, the Skyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow G/H \times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which generalizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz is constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$ spheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do not fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is completely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for $G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the dimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite number of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological charge and for each value of $N \geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each values of $p,\,q\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\otimes SU(q)\otimes U(1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions. The relation for the minimal space cell volume, similar to the minimal phase-space cell of Heisenberg is suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider properties of the gravitational path integral, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$, of a four-dimensional gravitational effective field theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$ at the quantum level. To leading order, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ is dominated by a four-sphere saddle subject to small fluctuations. Beyond this, ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ receives contributions from additional geometries that may include Einstein metrics of positive curvature. We discuss how a general positive curvature Einstein metric contributes to ${Z}_{\text{grav}}$ at one-loop level. Along the way, we discuss Einstein-Maxwell theory with $\Lambda&gt;0$, and identify an interesting class of closed non-Einstein gravitational instantons. We provide a detailed study for the specific case of $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which is distinguished as the saddle with second largest volume and positive definite tensor eigenspectrum. We present exact one-loop results for scalar particles, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity about the Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}P^2$.</description>

      <title>On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models. This dual regime manifests itself in the conformal perturbation approach. Namely, it is well known that conventional YB-deformed $\mathrm{O}(N)$ sigma models are described in the UV by a collection of free bosonic fields perturbed by some relevant operators. The holomorphic parts of these operators play the role of screening operators which define certain integrable systems in the free theory. All of these integrable systems depend on a continuous parameter $b$, which parametrizes the central charge, and are known to possess the duality under $b^2\longleftrightarrow -1-b^2$. Although $\mathrm{O}(2N+1)$ integrable systems are self-dual, $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ systems are not. In particular, the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ integrable systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation.</description>

Abstract: We explore light-ray operators in the critical O$(N)$ model in the large-$N$ limit, focusing on leading-twist and leading ``horizontal" trajectories. We distinguish between light-ray operators in two conformal frames: detector operators, which characterize event shapes of final states, and distribution operators, which probe initial-state distributions. In particular, we identify parton distribution functions (PDFs) and collinear functions as matrix elements of appropriate distribution operators. We renormalize some simple detector operators at leading order in $1/N$, allowing us to extract the Regge intercept and the anomalous spin of the leading horizontal trajectory. We furthermore renormalize distribution versions of these operators, obtaining the leading-twist splitting function and a BFKL-type kernel, which match results from the detector frame. Finally, we show how these results can be read off from OPE data encoded in the Bethe-Salpeter resummation of conformal four-point functions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two classes of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, garners a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{1} \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed as loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{2}\phi^{-2/3})$, also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$. Our work differs from the original loop blow-up inflation in terms of stabilization mechanism and subsequently the scalar-to tensor ratio.</description>

      <title>JT de Sitter Gravity as a Model of Coleman-de Luccia Tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the Euclidean solution of JT de Sitter gravity as the Coleman-de Luccia instanton for the decay of the low-entropy horizon of its static patch solution into either a Big Crunch or an infinite-entropy Lorentzian de Sitter cosmology. As in previous work by one of the authors, the Big Crunch is interpreted as bounding the entropy of the static state. The principle of detailed balance then guarantees it will transition back to a higher entropy causal diamond in the expanding cosmology. We then construct a family of explicit quantum mechanical models and appropriate metastable states, with transition probabilities well approximated by the semi-classical calculations in JT de Sitter gravity.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur partition functions and RG flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a double-scaled limit of the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) which generalizes the Schur index. The resulting partition function, $\hat {\cal Z}(q,\alpha)$, has a standard $q$-expansion with coefficients depending on a continuous parameter $\alpha$. The Schur index is a special case with $\alpha=1$. Through explicit computations we argue that this partition function is an invariant of certain mass deformations and vacuum expectation value (vev) deformations of the SCFT. In particular, two SCFTs residing in different corners of the same Coulomb branch, satisfying certain restrictive conditions, have the same partition function with a non-trivial map of the parameters, $\hat {\cal Z}_1(q,\alpha_1)=\hat {\cal Z}_2(q,\alpha_2(\alpha_1))$. For example, we show that the Schur index of all the SCFTs in the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c series is given by special values of $\alpha$ of the partition function of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Chord Intertwiner, Multiple Shocks and Switchback in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the bulk Hilbert space interpretation of chords in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model and introduce a notion of intertwiner that constructs bulk states from states with fixed boundary conditions. This leads to an isometric map that factorizes the one-particle bulk Hilbert space into a tensor product of two boundary Hilbert spaces without particle insertion. The map enables a systematic derivation of a family of correlation functions with arbitrary finite amount of matter insertions, relevant for capturing the switchback effect-a feature of holographic complexity. We further develop a path integral framework that describes multiple shockwave configurations in the semiclassical limit. For the two-body scattering processes in semi-classical regime, we show it exhibits sub-maximal chaos at finite temperature, consistent with the scramblon dynamics associated with the "fake disk" geometry. The effective "fake temperature" governing this behavior emerges from the semiclassical limit of the quantum $6 j$-symbol associated with the out-of-time-order correlator. We further analyze multi-shockwave configurations and derive precise conditions under which the switchback effect is realized, both in terms of the total chord number and the Krylov complexity of precursor operators. Our results clarify the structure of correlation functions with multiple operator insertions, their bulk interpretation in terms of shockwave geometries in the semiclassical regime, and provide a microscopic derivation of the switchback effect in the DSSYK model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I derive a new charge constraint that ties the four angular momenta in a $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS sector of the Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase (BMN) supersymmetric $U(N)$ matrix quantum mechanics. The result is related to the charge constraint of the $U(N)$, $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) conformal field theory at large $N$ by identifying three SYM charges with three BMN angular momenta generating $SO(6)$, two equal SYM angular momenta with a BMN generator of $SO(3)$, and scaling $N^2$ by $3$. The BMN charge constraint could be useful to determine whether there exists a dual supersymmetric black hole solution asymptoting to a plane-wave background.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Fractional Order Phase Transitions in CFTs Dual to AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the CFT phase transitions of various AdS black hole solutions, including the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black hole, the ModMax-AdS black hole, and the RN-AdS black hole formulated within the framework of Kaniadakis statistics, through the lens of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Employing the generalized Ehrenfest classification scheme based on fractional-order derivatives, we analyze the nature of phase transitions at both Davies points and critical points. Davies points, defined as the loci of divergent heat capacity, are typically associated with second-order transitions in the classical Ehrenfest paradigm. However, a refined analysis reveals that these points can be categorized into two distinct types: the first corresponds to extrema in the temperature profile, while the second aligns with its inflection point, i.e., the thermodynamic critical point. Our findings demonstrate that the order of the phase transition is sensitive to this classification, with the first type corresponding to a fractional order of $3/2$, and the second to $4/3$, which is consistent across RN-AdS black holes. Notably, when a specific constraint is imposed, we observe a $3/2$-order phase transition for both the RN-AdS and ModMax-AdS black holes, whereas in the case of the RN-AdS black hole with Kaniadakis statistics, two critical points arise under constrained paths, each exhibiting a transition of order $4/3$. This generalized, fractional-order framework enables a more precise and discriminating characterization of CFT phase transitions in holographic settings, revealing distinctions that remain hidden under traditional classifications. The results provide deeper insight into the rich structure of black hole thermodynamics on the CFT side and highlight the significance of fractional calculus as a powerful tool for probing critical phenomena within the AdS/CFT framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of mirror group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and transforms the original orbifold into a mirror one. This transformation is by construction an isomorphism of $N=(2,2)$ models. We illustrate our construction for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

Abstract: We develop a framework for holographic thermodynamics in finite-cutoff holography, extending the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to incorporate a finite radial cutoff in the bulk and a $T^2$-deformed CFT on the boundary. We formulate the first laws of thermodynamics for a Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS) black hole with a Dirichlet cutoff on the quasilocal boundary and its dual deformed CFT, introducing the deformation parameter as a thermodynamic variable. The holographic Euler relation for the deformed CFT and its equation of state are derived, alongside the Smarr relation for the bulk. We show that the Rupert teardrop coexistence curve defines a phase space island where deformation flow alters states, with up to three deformed CFTs or cut-off SAdS sharing a same phase transition temperature, one matching the seed CFT or original SAdS. These results offer insights into gravitational thermodynamics with boundary constraints and quantum gravity in finite spacetime regions.</description>

Abstract: This is the 10th and final chapter of my book on Quantum Information, based on the course I have been teaching at Caltech since 1997. An earlier version of this chapter (originally Chapter 5) has been available on the course website since 1998, but this version is substantially revised and expanded. Topics covered include classical Shannon theory, quantum compression, quantifying entanglement, accessible information, and using the decoupling principle to derive achievable rates for quantum protocols. This is a draft, pre-publication copy of Chapter 10, which I will continue to update. See the URL on the title page for further updates and drafts of other chapters, and please send me an email if you notice errors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

Abstract: In 1983, Feingold and Frenkel discovered a relation between Siegel modular forms of genus two and a rank-three hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra extending the affine Lie algebra of type $A_1$. It inspires a problem to explore more general relations between affine Lie algebras, hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras and modular forms. In this paper, we give an automorphic answer to this problem. We classify hyperbolic Borcherds--Kac--Moody superalgebras whose super-denominators define reflective automorphic products of singular weight on lattices of type $2U\oplus L$. As a consequence, we prove that there are exactly $81$ affine Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ which have extensions to hyperbolic BKM superalgebras for which the leading Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of super-denominators coincide with the denominators of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We find that $69$ of them appear in Schellekens' list of semi-simple $V_1$ structures of holomorphic CFT of central charge $24$, while $8$ of them correspond to the $N=1$ structures of holomorphic SCFT of central charge $12$ composed of $24$ chiral fermions. The last $4$ cases are related to exceptional modular invariants from nontrivial automorphisms of fusion algebras. This clarifies the relationship of affine Lie algebras, vertex algebras and hyperbolic BKM superalgebras at the level of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry I: Smooth Sets of Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most modern theoretical considerations of the physical world suggest that nature is: (1) field-theoretic, (2) smooth, (3) local, (4) gauged, (5) containing fermions, and (6) non-perturbative. Tautologous as this may sound to experts, it is remarkable that the mathematical notion of geometry which reflects all of these aspects - namely, ``supergeometric homotopy theory'' - has received little attention. Elaborate algebraic machinery is known for perturbative field theories both at the classical and quantum level, but to tackle the deep open questions of the subject, these will need to be lifted to a global geometry of physics.
  Our aim in this series is to introduce inclined physicists to this theory, to fill mathematical gaps in the existing literature, and to rigorously develop the full power of supergeometric homotopy theory and apply it to the analysis of fermionic (not necessarily super-symmetric) field theories. Secondarily, this will also lead to a streamlined and rigorous perspective we hope would also be desirable to mathematicians.
  In this first part, we explain how classical bosonic Lagrangian field theory (variational Euler-Lagrange theory) finds a natural home in the ``topos of smooth sets'', thereby neatly setting the scene for the higher supergeometry discussed in later parts of the series. This introductory material will be largely known to a few experts but has never been comprehensively laid out before. A key technical point we make is to regard jet bundle geometry systematically in smooth sets instead of just its subcategories of diffeological spaces or even Fr{\'e}chet manifolds -- or worse simply as a formal object. Besides being more transparent and powerful, it is only on this backdrop that a reasonable supergeometric jet geometry exists, needed for satisfactory discussion of any field theory with fermions.</description>

      <title>Echoes and quasi-normal modes of perturbations around Schwarzchild traversable wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the waveforms and quasi-normal modes around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes under different field perturbations, including the scalar field, the electromagnetic (vector) field, and the axial gravitational (tensor) field perturbations. Our results indicate that under the influence of the matter at the throat of the wormhole, a Dirac $\delta$-function distribution of matter appears in the effective potentials of the scalar and axial gravitational perturbations and it affects the propagation of these two types of perturbations in spacetime. However, the matter at the throat has no influence on the propagation of electromagnetic perturbations. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of throat matter on both the perturbation waveforms and quasi-normal modes for all three field types. Through comparative studies between Schwarzschild traversable wormholes and Schwarzschild black holes, we identify two distinct features. Firstly, the perturbation waveforms exhibit echoes and damping oscillations around wormholes, whereas they solely display damping oscillations around black holes. Secondly, the difference between the adjacent peaks varies with the mass parameter and the throat radial coordinate in the waveform around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while a constant peak spacing occurs, which is determined solely by mass, in the waveform around Schwarzschild black holes. Based on these findings, we propose a framework to estimate the mass parameter and throat radial coordinate of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes through waveforms and quasi-normal modes. Our analyses provide a more profound comprehension of the inherent characteristics of Schwarzschild traversable wormholes.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone Connections and their Yang-Mills Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

      <title>Gravitational field and lensing of a circular chiral vorton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii)the Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharonov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry can be interpreted as a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations with a scalar field: quadratic-order effective energy-momentum tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar and tensor modes of the gravitational perturbation in the presence of a scalar field which describes inflation. We investigate the back-reaction of the perturbations to the background by studying the effective energy-momentum tensor (2EMT) which is the second order constructed by the quadratic terms of the linear perturbations. 2EMT is gauge dependent due to the scalar mode. We obtain 2EMT in the slow-roll stage of inflation, and get its cosmological expressions in three (longitudinal, spatially flat, and comoving) gauge conditions. We find that the pure scalar-mode part in 2EMT is stronger in the short-wavelength limit, while the parts involved with the tensor mode (the pure tensor-mode part and the scalar-tensor coupled part) are stronger in the long-wavelength limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Scalar Fields in Modified Gravity: A Comparison with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze electromagnetic (EM) radiations arising from scalar fields predicted by modified gravity theories and compare these features with those induced by axion-like particles (ALPs). Scalar and axion fields couple differently to the EM field due to their distinct parity properties, $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ for scalar fields and $\phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ for axions. Building on analytical methods developed for ALPs, this work presents a theoretical feasibility analysis that demonstrates how the scalar field in modified gravity could produce observable EM signatures from oscillating field configurations. We also show that resonance effects can amplify the EM radiation for the scalar field under specific conditions, and that the enhancement mechanisms depend on the coupling structure and the configuration of the background magnetic field. Resonance phenomena can accentuate the differences in signal strength and spectral features, potentially aiding future observations in distinguishing scalar fields from ALPs. This work provides a theoretical framework for studying generic pure and pseudo-scalar fields on an equal footing and suggests new avenues for observational tests of modified gravity scenarios alongside ALP models.</description>

Abstract: Spherically symmetric geometrodynamics is studied for scalar-tensor theory and Einstein General Relativity minimally coupled to a scalar field. We discussed the importance of boundary terms and derived the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian canonical formalism both in the Jordan and Einstein frames. These two frames are connected through an Hamiltonian canonical transformation on the reduced phase space obtained gauge-fixing the lapse and the radial shift functions. We discussed the effects of the singularity of the Hamiltonian canonical transformation connecting Jordan and Einstein frames for two static solutions (Fisher, Janis, Newman and Winicour solution in the Einstein frame and Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole solution in the Jordan frame).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the general twisted intertwining operators (intertwining operators among twisted modules) for a vertex operator algebra $V$. We give the skew-symmetry and contragredient isomorphisms between spaces of twisted intertwining operators and also prove some other properties of twisted intertwining operators. Using twisted intertwining operators, we introduce a notion of $P(z)$-tensor product of two objects for $z\in \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ in a category of suitable $g$-twisted $V$-modules for $g$ in a group of automorphisms of $V$ and give a construction of such a $P(z)$-tensor product under suitable assumptions. We also construct $G$-crossed commutativity isomorphisms and $G$-crossed braiding isomorphisms. We formulate a $P(z)$-compatibility condition and a $P(z)$-grading-restriction condition and use these conditions to give another construction of the $P(z)$-tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive formulae that resum, at a given order in the soft limit, the infinite series of Post-Minkowskian (small gravitational coupling) or Post-Newtonian (small velocities) corrections to the gravitational waveform produced by particles moving along a general (open or closed) trajectory in the Schwarzschild geometry in the probe limit. Specifying to the case of circular orbits, we compute the waveform and the energy flux to order 30PN, and compare it against the available results in the literature. Our results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the solutions of the Heun equation (and its confluence), that leads to a simple mathematical proof of the Heun connection formula.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term $\chi$ is not zero, although largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also much suppressed. The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of $Q_a$ is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when $Q_t$ is around -1.</description>

      <title>The problem of reconstruction for static spherically-symmetric $4D$ metrics in scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the $4D$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The action of the model contains a potential term $U(\varphi)$, Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f(\varphi)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm1 $, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to ordinary scalar field and $\varepsilon = -1 $ - to phantom one. Inspired by the recent works of Nojiri and Nashed, we explore a reconstruction procedure for a generic static spherically symmetric metric written in the Buchdal parametrization: $ds^2 = \left(A(u)\right)^{-1}du^2 - A(u)dt^2 + C(u)d\Omega^2$, with given $A(u) &gt; 0$ and $C(u) &gt; 0$. The procedure gives the relations for $U(\varphi(u))$, $f(\varphi(u))$ and $d\varphi/du$, which lead to exact solutions to equations of motion with a given metric. A key role in this approach is played by the solutions to a second order linear differential equation for the function $f(\varphi(u))$. The formalism is illustrated by two examples when: a) the Schwarzschild metric and b) the Ellis wormhole metric, are chosen as a starting point. For the first case a) the black hole solution with a ``trapped ghost'' is found which describes an ordinary scalar field outside the photon sphere and phantom scalar field inside the photon sphere. For the second case b) the sEGB-extension of the Ellis wormhole solution is found when the coupling function reads: $f(\varphi) = c_1 + c_0 ( \tan ( \varphi) + \frac{1}{3} (\tan ( \varphi))^3)$, where $c_1$ and $c_0$ are constants.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical nonlinear tails in Schwarzschild black hole ringdown</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

      <title>Constraining CPT-odd electromagnetic chiral parameters with pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The arrival time of electromagnetic signals traveling in chiral cosmic media is investigated in the context of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics. Considering the interstellar medium (ISM) as a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also addressed in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of heavy quarks by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our investigation of heavy quark transport coefficients in the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) -- which reproduces nonperturbative QCD phenomena in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) according to lattice QCD data -- by including inelastic $2 \to 3$ processes with massive gluon radiation, in addition to elastic $2 \to 2$ parton scattering. Both elastic and inelastic reactions are evaluated at leading order using DQPM-based effective propagators and vertices, accounting for all channels and their interferences. Based on the obtained matrix elements, we calculate various observables connected to a charm quark. First, we calculate the total cross section of a charm quark with the medium partons as functions of temperature and collision energy. Second, we obtain the drag $\mathcal{A}$ coefficient and $\hat{q}$ coefficient of a charm quark as functions of temperature and momentum and also compare our results with those obtained using the Zakharov model for the momentum-dependent strong coupling for the elastic and radiative vertices with a heavy quark, highlighting the importance of the choice of the strong coupling in the determination of transport coefficients. Third, we calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of a charm quark and compare our results with those obtained using other approaches. Finally, we explore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the results for charm quark, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quark. We found that inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of the transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly suppressed at low transverse momenta.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Primordial Black Holes, Dimensionless Small Parameter, Inflationary Cosmology and Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work consideration is given to the primordial black holes ({\bf pbhs}) in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Metric with small mass (ultralight) in the preinflationary epoch. Within the scope of natural assumptions, it has been shown that the quantum-gravitational corrections ({\bf qgcs}) to the characteristics of such black holes can contribute to all the cosmological parameters, shifting them compared with the semiclassical consideration. These contributions are determined by a series expansion in terms of a small parameter dependent on the hole mass (radius). For this pattern different cases have been considered (stationary, black hole evaporation...). It has been demonstrated that involvement of ({\bf qgcs}) leads to a higher probability for the occurrence of such {\bf pbhs}. Besides, high-energy deformations of Friedmann Equations created on the basis of these corrections have been derived for different patterns. In the last section of this work it is introduced a study into the contributions generated by the above-mentioned {\bf qgcs} in inflationary cosmological perturbations. Besides, it has been shown that non-Gaussianity of these perturbations is higher as compared to the semi-classical pattern.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Kalb-Ramond black hole on neutrino behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the consequences of Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity on neutrino dynamics. The analysis is structured around three key phenomena: the energy output associated with neutrino-antineutrino annihilation, the impact of spacetime geometry on the oscillation phases of neutrinos, and the changes in flavor transition probabilities caused by gravitational lensing effects. To complement the theoretical framework, we also carry out a numerical evaluation of neutrino oscillation probabilities, comparing scenarios of normal and inverted mass orderings within a two-flavor approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of proving global stability, based on symplectic geometry and with a focus on systems with several conserved quantities. We also provide a proof of instability for integrable systems whose momentum map is everywhere regular. Our results take root in the recently proposed notion of a confining function and are motivated by ghost-ridden systems, for whom we put forward the first geometric definition.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by curvature : Analysis via non-perturbative 2PI Hartree approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) induced by a classical background spacetime's curvature, via the 2 particle irreducible (2PI) non-perturbative effective action formalism. We use the standard Schwinger-DeWitt local expansion of the Feynman propagator, appropriate to probe the effect of spacetime curvature on the local or short scale physics. Recently it was shown using perturbative computations that such SSB is possible with a scalar with a quartic self interaction, positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling. Here we confirm in the two loop Hartree approximation that curvature can indeed induce SSB for such a theory. SSB for such a model is not possible in a flat spacetime. The 2PI technique does not only resum the self energy resulting in mass generation, but also resums, as we have discussed, curvature terms through such mass generation. We have explicitly discussed our results in the context of the de Sitter spacetime, although our calculations are valid for any non-singular curved spacetime. We show that, in contrast to the perturbative results, SSB is possible with a vanishing non-minimal coupling. These results are further extended to the case of an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory. Restoration of the broken symmetry in the thermal case is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the local thermodynamic relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by providing two specific examples, that the local differential thermodynamic relations used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin, do not hold even at global thermodynamic equilibrium. We show, by using a rigorous quantum statistical method, that for massless free fermions and massive free fermions with rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium, the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential differs from the spin density and acquires a correction of the same order. Such correction cannot be eliminated by any redefinition of the entropy current, a so-called entropy-gauge transformation. Therefore, for an accurate determination of the constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional method of assuming differential thermodynamic relations is not appropriate.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>
