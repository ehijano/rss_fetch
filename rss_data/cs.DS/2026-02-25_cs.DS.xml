      <title>Exploiting Low-Rank Structure in Max-K-Cut Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We approach the Max-3-Cut problem through the lens of maximizing complex-valued quadratic forms and demonstrate that low-rank structure in the objective matrix can be exploited, leading to alternative algorithms to classical semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations and heuristic techniques. We propose an algorithm for maximizing these quadratic forms over a domain of size $K$ that enumerates and evaluates a set of $O\left(n^{2r-1}\right)$ candidate solutions, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix and $r$ represents the rank of an approximation of the objective. We prove that this candidate set is guaranteed to include the exact maximizer when $K=3$ (corresponding to Max-3-Cut) and the objective is low-rank, and provide approximation guarantees when the objective is a perturbation of a low-rank matrix. This construction results in a family of novel, inherently parallelizable and theoretically-motivated algorithms for Max-3-Cut. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing algorithms across a wide range of graphs, while being highly scalable.</description>

      <title>Turing Completeness of GNU find: From mkdir-assisted Loops to Standalone Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unix command \texttt{find} is among the first commands taught to beginners, yet remains indispensable for experienced engineers. In this paper, we demonstrate that \texttt{find} possesses unexpected computational power, establishing three Turing completeness results using the GNU implementation (a standard in Linux distributions). (1) \texttt{find} + \texttt{mkdir} (a system that has only \texttt{find} and \texttt{mkdir}) is Turing complete: by encoding computational states as directory paths and using regex back-references to copy substrings, we simulate 2-tag systems. (2) GNU \texttt{find} 4.9.0+ alone is Turing complete: by reading and writing to files during traversal, we simulate a two-counter machine without \texttt{mkdir}. (3) \texttt{find} + \texttt{mkdir} without regex back-references is still Turing complete: by a trick of encoding regex patterns directly into directory names, we achieve the same power.
  These results place \texttt{find} among the ``surprisingly Turing-complete'' systems, highlighting the hidden complexity within seemingly simple standard utilities.</description>

      <title>DRESS: A Continuous Framework for Structural Graph Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy is a cornerstone framework for graph isomorphism testing and structural analysis. However, scaling beyond 1-WL to 3-WL and higher requires tensor-based operations that scale as O(n^3) or O(n^4), making them computationally prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, Leon, and Gomez, 2018)--a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges--and show that it distinguishes the prism graph from K_{3,3}, a pair that 1-WL provably cannot separate. We then generalize it to Motif-DRESS, which replaces triangle neighborhoods with arbitrary structural motifs and converges to a unique fixed point under three sufficient conditions, and further to Generalized-DRESS, an abstract template parameterized by the choice of neighborhood operator, aggregation function and norm. Finally, we introduce Delta-DRESS, which runs DRESS on each node-deleted subgraph G\{v}, connecting the framework to the Kelly-Ulam reconstruction conjecture. Both Motif-DRESS and Delta-DRESS empirically distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs (SRGs)--such as the Rook and Shrikhande graphs--that confound 3-WL. Our results establish the DRESS family as a highly scalable framework that empirically surpasses both 1-WL and 3-WL on well-known benchmark graphs, without the prohibitive O(n^4) computational cost.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness on Insertion-Deletion Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study adversarially robust algorithms for insertion-deletion (turnstile) streams, where future updates may depend on past algorithm outputs. While robust algorithms exist for insertion-only streams with only a polylogarithmic overhead in memory over non-robust algorithms, it was widely conjectured that turnstile streams of length polynomial in the universe size $n$ require space linear in $n$. We refute this conjecture, showing that robustness can be achieved using space which is significantly sublinear in $n$. Our framework combines multiple linear sketches in a novel estimator-corrector-learner framework, yielding the first insertion-deletion algorithms that approximate: (1) the second moment $F_2$ up to a $(1+\varepsilon)$-factor in polylogarithmic space, (2) any symmetric function $\cal{F}$ with an $\mathcal{O}(1)$-approximate triangle inequality up to a $2^{\mathcal{O}(C)}$ factor in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{1/C}) \cdot S(n)$ bits of space, where $S$ is the space required to approximate $\cal{F}$ non-robustly; this includes a broad class of functions such as the $L_1$-norm, the support size $F_0$, and non-normed losses such as the $M$-estimators, and (3) $L_2$ heavy hitters. For the $F_2$ moment, our algorithm is optimal up to $\textrm{poly}((\log n)/\varepsilon)$ factors. Given the recent results of Gribelyuk et al. (STOC, 2025), this shows an exponential separation between linear sketches and non-linear sketches for achieving adversarial robustness in turnstile streams.</description>

      <title>A $2$-branching construction for the $\chi \leq 2r$ bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string repetitiveness measures $\chi$ (the size of a smallest suffixient set of a string) and $r$ (the number of runs in the Burrows--Wheeler Transform) are related. Recently, we have shown that the bound $\chi \leq 2r$, proved by Navarro et al., is asymptotically tight as the size $\sigma$ of the alphabet increases, but achieving near-tight ratios for fixed $\sigma &gt; 2$ remained open. We introduce a \emph{2-branching property}: a cyclic string is 2-branching at order~$k$ if every $(k{-}1)$-length substring admits exactly two $k$-length extensions. We show that 2-branching strings of order~$k$ yield closed-form ratios $\chi/r = (2\sigma^{k-1}+1)/(\sigma^{k-1}+4)$. For order~$3$, we give an explicit construction for every $\sigma \geq 2$, narrowing the gap to~$2$ from $O(1/\sigma)$ to $O(1/\sigma^2)$. For $\sigma \in \{3,4\}$, we additionally present order-$5$ instances with ratios exceeding~$1.91$.</description>

      <title>A Space-space Trade-off for Directed st-Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a space-space trade-off for directed $st$-connectivity in the catalytic space model. For any integer $k \leq n$, we give an algorithm that decides directed $st$-connectivity using $O(\log n \cdot \log k+\log n)$ regular workspace and $O\left(\frac{n}{k} \cdot \log^2 n\right)$ bits of catalytic memory. This interpolates between the classical $O(\log^2 n)$-space bound from Savitch's algorithm and a catalytic endpoint with $O(\log n)$ workspace and $O(n\cdot \log^2 n)$ catalytic memory.
  As a warm-up, we present a catalytic variant of Savitch's algorithm achieving the endpoint above. Up to logarithmic factors, this matches the smallest catalyst size currently known for catalytic logspace algorithms, due to Cook and Pyne (ITCS 2026). Our techniques also extend to counting the number of walks from $s$ to $t$ of a given length $\ell\leq n$.</description>

      <title>Frontier Space-Time Algorithms Using Only Full Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop catalytic algorithms for fundamental problems in algorithm design that run in polynomial time, use only $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ workspace, and use sublinear catalytic space matching the best-known space bounds of non-catalytic algorithms running in polynomial time.
  First, we design a polynomial time algorithm for directed $s$-$t$ connectivity using $n \big/ 2^{\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})}$ catalytic space, which matches the state-of-the-art time-space bounds in the non-catalytic setting [Barnes et al., 1998], and improves the catalytic space usage of the best known algorithm [Cook and Pyne, 2026]. Furthermore, using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ random bits we get a randomized algorithm whose running time nearly matches the fastest time bounds known for space-unrestricted algorithms.
  Second, we design polynomial time algorithms for the problems of computing Edit Distance, Longest Common Subsequence, and the Discrete Fr\'{e}chet Distance, again using $n \big/ 2^{\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})}$ catalytic space. This again matches non-catalytic time-space frontier for Edit Distance and Least Common Subsequence [Kiyomi et al., 2021].</description>

      <title>Online Algorithms with Unreliable Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new model for ML-augmented online decision making, called online algorithms with unreliable guidance (OAG). This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $\beta$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $\beta = 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $\beta = 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $\beta$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.
  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Implicit Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision Diagrams (DDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for discrete optimization, with rapidly growing adoption. DDs are directed acyclic layered graphs; restricted DDs are a generalized greedy heuristic for finding feasible solutions, and relaxed DDs compute combinatorial relaxed bounds. There is substantial theory that leverages DD-based bounding, yet the complexity of constructing the DDs themselves has received little attention. Standard restricted DD construction requires $O(w \log(w))$ per layer; standard relaxed DD construction requires $O(w^2)$, where $w$ is the width of the DD. Increasing $w$ improves bound quality at the cost of more time and memory.
  We introduce implicit Decision Diagrams, storing arcs implicitly rather than explicitly, and reducing per-layer complexity to $O(w)$ for restricted and relaxed DDs. We prove this is optimal: any framework treating state-update and merge operations as black boxes cannot do better.
  Optimal complexity shifts the challenge from algorithmic overhead to low-level engineering. We show how implicit DDs can drive a MIP solver, and release ImplicitDDs.jl, an open-source Julia solver exploiting the implementation refinements our theory enables. Experiments demonstrate the solver outperforms Gurobi on Subset Sum.</description>

      <title>Ski Rental with Distributional Predictions of Unknown Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the central online problem of ski rental in the "algorithms with predictions" framework from the point of view of distributional predictions. Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} &lt; o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.
  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Classical Acceleration for $\ell_1$-Regularized PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the degree-weighted work required to compute $\ell_1$-regularized PageRank using the standard one-gradient-per-iteration accelerated proximal-gradient method (FISTA). For non-accelerated local methods, the best known worst-case work scales as $\widetilde{O} ((\alpha\rho)^{-1})$, where $\alpha$ is the teleportation parameter and $\rho$ is the $\ell_1$-regularization parameter. A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $\alpha$ from $1/\alpha$ to $1/\sqrt{\alpha}$ while preserving the $1/\rho$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\mathcal{B}$. This yields a bound consisting of an accelerated $(\rho\sqrt{\alpha})^{-1}\log(\alpha/\varepsilon)$ term plus a boundary overhead $\sqrt{vol(\mathcal{B})}/(\rho\alpha^{3/2})$. We provide graph-structural conditions that imply such confinement. Experiments on synthetic and real graphs show the resulting speedup and slowdown regimes under the degree-weighted work model.</description>

      <title>Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Smoothed Agnostic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\tilde{O}(1/\sigma^2) \log(1/\epsilon)}$, where $\sigma$ is the smoothing parameter and $\epsilon$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{\Omega(1/\sigma^{2}+\log(1/\epsilon))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies algorithms for computing a Gomory-Hu tree, which is a classical data structure that compactly stores all minimum $s$-$t$ cuts of an undirected weighted graph. We consider two classes of algorithms: the original method by Gomory and Hu and the method based on "OrderedCuts" that we recently proposed. We describe practical implementations of these methods, and compare them experimentally with the algorithms from the previous experimental studies by Goldberg and Tsioutsiouliklis (2001) and by Akibo et al. (2016) (designed for unweighted simple graphs). Results indicate that the method based on OrderedCuts is the most robust, and often outperforms other implementations by a large factor.</description>

      <title>OrderedCuts: A new approach for computing Gomory-Hu tree</title>

Abstract: The Gomory-Hu tree, or a cut tree, is a classic data structure that stores minimum $s$-$t$ cuts of an undirected weighted graph for all pairs of nodes $(s,t)$. We propose a new approach for computing the cut tree based on a reduction to the problem that we call {\tt OrderedCuts}. Given a sequence of nodes $s,v_1,\ldots,v_\ell$, its goal is to compute minimum $\{s,v_1,\ldots,v_{i-1}\}$-$v_i$ cuts for all $i\in[\ell]$. We show that the cut tree can be computed by $\tilde O(1)$ calls to {\tt OrderedCuts}. We also establish new results for {\tt OrderedCuts} that may be of independent interest. First, we prove that all $\ell$ cuts can be stored compactly with $O(n)$ space in a data structure that we call an {\em {\tt OC} tree}. Second, we prove results that allow divide-and-conquer algorithms for computing OC tree. Finally, we describe a practical implementation based on {\tt OrderedCuts}, and compare it experimentally with two existing implementations of the classical Gomory-Hu tree algorithm as well as with our implementations. The results suggest that the {\tt OrderedCuts}-based approach is the most robust: on many family of problems it outperforms other algorithms by 1-2 orders of magnitude, and is never slower by more than a small factor. Our implementation is publicly available at https://pub.ist.ac.at/~vnk/software.html.</description>

      <title>Improved Rank Aggregation under Fairness Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregating multiple input rankings into a consensus ranking is essential in various fields such as social choice theory, hiring, college admissions, web search, and databases. A major challenge is that the optimal consensus ranking might be biased against individual candidates or groups, especially those from marginalized communities. This concern has led to recent studies focusing on fairness in rank aggregation. The goal is to ensure that candidates from different groups are fairly represented in the top-$k$ positions of the aggregated ranking.
  We study this fair rank aggregation problem by considering the Kendall tau as the underlying metric. While we know of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the classical rank aggregation problem, the corresponding fair variant only possesses a quite straightforward 3-approximation algorithm due to Wei et al., SIGMOD'22, and Chakraborty et al., NeurIPS'22, which finds closest fair ranking for each input ranking and then simply outputs the best one.
  In this paper, we first provide a novel algorithm that achieves $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation (for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$), significantly improving over the 3-approximation bound. Next, we provide a $2.881$-approximation fair rank aggregation algorithm that works irrespective of the fairness notion, given one can find a closest fair ranking, beating the 3-approximation bound. We complement our theoretical guarantee by performing extensive experiments on various real-world datasets to establish the effectiveness of our algorithm further by comparing it with the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Splittable Spanning Trees and Balanced Forests in Dense Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the probability that a spanning tree chosen uniformly at random from a graph can be partitioned into a fixed number $k$ of trees of equal size by removing $k-1$ edges. In that case, the spanning tree is called {\em splittable}. Splittable spanning trees are useful in algorithms for sampling {\em balanced forests}, forests whose components are of equal size, and for sampling partitions of a graph into components of equal size, with applications in redistricting, network algorithms, and image decomposition. Cannon et al.~recently showed that spanning trees on grid and grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized components with probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling algorithm for balanced forests in any class of graphs. Focusing on the complementary case of dense random graphs, we show that random spanning trees have inverse polynomial probability of being splittable; specifically, a random spanning tree is splittable with probability at least $n^{(-k/2)}$ for both the $G(n,p)$ and $G(n,m)$ models when $p = \Omega(1/\log n)$, giving the first dense class of graphs where partitions of equal size can be sampled efficiently.
  In addition, we present an infinite family of graphs with properties that have been conjectured to ensure splittability (i.e., Hamiltonian subgraphs of the triangular lattice) and prove that random spanning trees are not splittable with more than exponentially small probability. As a consequence, we show that a family of widely-used Markov chain algorithms for sampling equal-size partitions will fail on this family of graphs if their state spaces are restricted to equal-size partitions. Moreover, we show these algorithms will be inefficient if their state spaces are generalized to include any unbalanced partitions, suggesting barriers for sampling balanced partitions in sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>One-Sided Local Crossing Minimization</title>

Abstract: Drawing graphs with the minimum number of crossings is a classical problem that has been studied extensively. Many restricted versions of the problem have been considered. For example, bipartite graphs can be drawn such that the two sets in the bipartition of the vertex set are mapped to two parallel lines, and the edges are drawn as straight-line segments. In this setting, the number of crossings depends only on the ordering of the vertices on the two lines. Two natural variants of the problem have been studied. In the one-sided case, the order of the vertices on one of the two lines is given and fixed; in the two-sided case, no order is given. Both cases are important subproblems in the so-called Sugiyama framework for drawing layered graphs with few crossings, and both turned out to be NP-hard. For the one-sided case, Eades and Wormald [Algorithmica 1994] introduced the median heuristic and showed that it has an approximation ratio of 3.
  In recent years, researchers have focused on a local version of crossing minimization where the aim is not to minimize the total number of crossings but the maximum number of crossings per edge. Kobayashi, Okada, and Wolff [SoCG 2025] investigated the complexity of local crossing minimization parameterized by the natural parameter. They showed that the weighted one-sided problem is NP-hard and conjectured that the unweighted one-sided case remains NP-hard. In this work, we confirm their conjecture. We also prove that the median heuristic with a specific tie-breaking scheme has an approximation ratio of 3.</description>

      <title>$\{s,t\}$-Separating Principal Partition Sequence of Submodular Functions</title>

Abstract: Narayanan showed the existence of the principal partition sequence of a submodular function, a structure with numerous applications in areas such as clustering, fast algorithms, and approximation algorithms. In this work, motivated by two applications, we develop a theory of $\{s,t\}$-separating principal partition sequence of a submodular function. We define this sequence, show its existence, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to construct it. We show two applications: (1) approximation algorithm for the $\{s,t\}$-separating submodular $k$-partitioning problem for monotone and posimodular functions and (2) polynomial-time algorithm for the hypergraph orientation problem of finding an orientation that simultaneously has strong connectivity at least $k$ and $(s,t)$-connectivity at least $\ell$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Shuffling Beyond Pure Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shuffling is a powerful way to amplify privacy of a local randomizer in private distributed data analysis. Most existing analyses of how shuffling amplifies privacy are based on the pure local differential privacy (DP) parameter $\varepsilon_0$. This paper raises the question of whether $\varepsilon_0$ adequately captures the privacy amplification. For example, since the Gaussian mechanism does not satisfy pure local DP for any finite $\varepsilon_0$, does it follow that shuffling yields weak amplification? To solve this problem, we revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop a direct asymptotic analysis that bypasses $\varepsilon_0$. Our key finding is that, asymptotically, the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\chi$ and that this dependence is monotonic. Therefore, this parameter serves as a proxy for shuffling efficiency, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this analysis to both upper and lower bounds of the shuffled mechanism's privacy profile, we obtain a band for its privacy guarantee through shuffle indices. Furthermore, we derive a simple structural, necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which this band collapses asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.</description>

      <title>FastReChain: A Novel Bidirectional Model-Based Algorithm for Topology Engineering of OCS-Based Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) technology is increasingly being adopted in data centers due to its advantages of low power consumption and low technology refresh costs. Unlike electrical packet switches, OCS provides programmable bandwidth for directly connected devices by configuring the mapping relationships of internal ports. Thus, how to calculate these internal port mapping relationships, i.e., Topology Engineering (ToE), is one of the key designs of OCS-based clusters.
  Current deployments usually design ToE algorithms by solving Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models, with the aim of minimizing modifications to links occupied by running tasks as much as possible. However, ILP-based ToE algorithms may incur excessive runtime overhead in large-scale clusters. Some existing ToE algorithms convert the ILP model into a Minimum-Cost Flow model through greedy construction, yet such greedy strategies may increase the number of affected links during the OCS reconfiguration process. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel bidirectional modeling approach, along with a corresponding FastReChain algorithm in this paper. We verify the superiority of this algorithm through simulation experiments based on real-trace data.</description>
