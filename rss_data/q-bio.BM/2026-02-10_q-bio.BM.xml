      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Redox Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redox biology underpins signalling, metabolism, immunity, and adaptation, yet lacks a unifying theoretical framework capable of formalising structure, function, and dynamics. Current interpretations rely on descriptive catalogues of molecules and reactions, obscuring how redox behaviour emerges from constrained biochemical organisation. Here, we present a mathematical theory of redox biology that resolves this gap by treating redox systems as finite, compositional, dynamical, and spatially embedded objects. We define a structured redox state space in which admissible molecular transformations form a neutral algebra of possibilities. Biological function emerges when this structure is embedded within a wider molecular network and interpreted through weighted flux distributions. Time-dependent reweighting of these transformations generates redox dynamics, while spatial embedding enforces locality and causality, yielding a distributed redox field. Within this framework, context dependence, nonlinearity, hysteresis, and memory arise naturally from bounded state spaces and irreversible transformations, without requiring ad hoc assumptions. This theory provides a working, predictive interpretative basis for redox biology: it constrains admissible states and trajectories, clarifies the meaning of redox measurements, and links chemical transformation to biological behaviour. Redox biology emerges as a geometric, dynamical process governed by lawful organisation.</description>

      <title>TerraBind: Fast and Accurate Binding Affinity Prediction through Coarse Structural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TerraBind, a foundation model for protein-ligand structure and binding affinity prediction that achieves 26-fold faster inference than state-of-the-art methods while improving affinity prediction accuracy by $\sim$20\%. Current deep learning approaches to structure-based drug design rely on expensive all-atom diffusion to generate 3D coordinates, creating inference bottlenecks that render large-scale compound screening computationally intractable. We challenge this paradigm with a critical hypothesis: full all-atom resolution is unnecessary for accurate small molecule pose and binding affinity prediction. TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_\beta$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module. On structure prediction benchmarks (FoldBench, PoseBusters, Runs N' Poses), TerraBind matches diffusion-based baselines in ligand pose accuracy. Crucially, TerraBind outperforms Boltz-2 by $\sim$20\% in Pearson correlation for binding affinity prediction on both a public benchmark (CASP16) and a diverse proprietary dataset (18 biochemical/cell assays). We show that the affinity prediction module also provides well-calibrated affinity uncertainty estimates, addressing a critical gap in reliable compound prioritization for drug discovery. Furthermore, this module enables a continual learning framework and a hedged batch selection strategy that, in simulated drug discovery cycles, achieves 6$\times$ greater affinity improvement of selected molecules over greedy-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Modeling Protein Evolution via Generative Inference From Monte Carlo Chains to Population Genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models derived from large protein sequence alignments define complex fitness landscapes, but their utility for accurately modeling non-equilibrium evolutionary dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Cliff: A Critical Proton Tunneling Threshold Determines Clinical Severity in RPE65-Mediated Retinal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting clinical severity from genotype remains a fundamental challenge in molecular medicine, particularly for enzymes whose function depends on sub-atomic-scale geometry. Mutations in the \textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the "Quantum Cliff," where minute structural changes (below 0.1 \AA) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of AI Protein Folding in ESMFold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical features such as charge flow from sequence representations into pairwise representations. In the second stage, late blocks develop pairwise spatial features: distance and contact information accumulate in the pairwise representation. We demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying structural decisions of ESMFold can be localized, traced through interpretable representations, and manipulated with strong causal effects.</description>
