      <description>arXiv:2503.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $2 \leq p \leq c \leq q$, we construct a finite simple graph $G$ with $\nu_1(G) = p$ and $\nu(G) = q$ for which the squarefree power $I(G)^{[k]}$ of the edge ideal $I(G)$ of $G$ has linear quotients for each $c \leq k \leq q$ and is not linearly related for each $1 \leq k &lt; c$, where $\nu_1(G)$ is the induced matching number of $G$ and $\nu(G)$ is the matching number of $G$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric decomposition of the Hilbert function of an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(R, \mathcal{M})$ be a local ring over a field $k$ with $k = R/\mathcal M$ and $J$ an ideal in $R$ such that $A =R/J$ is an Artinian Gorenstein (AG) $k$-algebra. In 1989, A. Iarrobino introduced the symmetric decomposition of the Hilbert function of $A$. This became a very powerful tool for classifying the Hilbert functions of AG $k$-algebras. In this article, we introduce the symmetric decomposition of the Hilbert function of any ideal $I$ in $A.$ Our hope is that this result will be useful in classifying the possible Hilbert function of an ideal in an AG $k$-algebra. We illustrate this by giving a complete list of $2$-admissible sequences of length at most $3$ and with $h_0=2$ that are realizable by an ideal in an AG $k$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a monomial ideal $I$, it is known that for increasing $n$ the number of minimal generators $\mu(I^n)$ eventually follows a polynomial pattern. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. We show that for large $n$ the ideal $I^n$ can be constructed from certain subideals of a specific power $I^s$. We determine $s$ explicitly in terms of $I$ and show that $s\le\mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is at most the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the minimal generators $\mathsf{G}(I)$. This provides an explicit description of $\mathsf{G}(I^n)$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, significantly reducing computational complexity in determining high powers of bivariate monomial ideals. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Differential and symbolic powers of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize symbolic powers of prime ideals in polynomial rings over any field in terms of $\mathbb{Z}$-linear differential operators, and of prime ideals in polynomial rings over complete discrete valuation rings with a $p$-derivation $\delta$ in terms of $\mathbb{Z}$-linear differential operators and of $\delta$. This extends previous work of the same authors, as it allows the removal of separability hypotheses that were otherwise necessary. The absence of separability and the fact that modules of $\mathbb{Z}$-linear differential operators are typically not finitely generated require the introduction of new techniques. As a byproduct, we extend a characterization of symbolic powers due to Cid-Ruiz which also holds in the nonsmooth case. Finally, we produce an example of an unramified discrete valuation ring that has no $p$-derivations.</description>

      <title>Valuative dimension, constructive points of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several classical characterisations of the valuative dimension of a commutative ring. Constructive versions of this dimension have been given and proven to be equivalent to the classical notion within classical mathematics, and they can be used for the usual examples of commutative rings. To the contrary of the classical versions, the constructive versions have a clear computational content. This paper investigates the computational relationship between three possible constructive definitions of the valuative dimension of a commutative ring. In doing so, it proves these constructive versions to be equivalent within constructive mathematics.</description>

      <title>Induced matching, ordered matching and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let G be a finite simple graph and let indm(G) and ordm(G) denote the induced matching number and the ordered matching number of G, respectively. We characterize all bipartite graphs G with indm(G) = ordm(G). We establish the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of powers of edge ideals and depth of powers of cover ideals for such graphs. We also give formulas for the count of connected non-isomorphic spanning subgraphs of the complete bipartite graph K_{m,n} for which indm(G) = ordm(G) = 2, with an explicit expression for the count when m = 2,3,4 and m &lt;= n.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Gorenstein (Normal) Finite Covers in Arbitrary Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any complete local (normal) domain admits a module-finite quasi-Gorenstein normal (complete local) domain extension. In the geometric vein, we show that any normal projective variety $X$ over a field admits a finite surjective morphism $Y\rightarrow X$ from a normal quasi-Gorenstein projective variety $Y$. Notably, our results resolve the previously open case for residual characteristic two.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the multiplicity of one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide an upper bound for the multiplicity of a one-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay ring (under certain conditions), describe the rings attaining the equality for this bound, and outline a connection with Wilf's conjecture for numerical semigroup rings. We also discuss these assumptions in higher dimension, proving that they are never satisfied if the dimension is larger than one, and provide some examples of rings which are not Cohen-Macaulay but still satisfy our bound.</description>

      <title>On complete distinguished chains, defectless unibranched extensions and some stability results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(K,v)$ be a valued field. Take an extension of $v$ to a fixed algebraic closure $L$ of $K$. In this paper we show that an element $a\in L$ admits a complete distinguished chain over $K$ if and only if the extension $(K(a)|K,v)$ is defectless and unibranched. This characterization generalizes the known result in the henselian case. In particular, our result shows that if $a$ admits a complete distinguished chain over $K$, then it also admits one over the henselization; however, the converse may not be true. The main tool employed in our analysis is the stability of the $j$-invariant associated to a valuation transcendental extension under passage to the henselization.
  We also explore the stability of defectless simple extensions in the following sense: let $(K(X)|K,w)$ be a valuation transcendental extension with a pair of definition $(b,\gamma)$ and assume that $(K(b)|K,w)$ is a defectless extension. We show that then the extension $(K(b,X)|K(X),w)$ is also defectless.</description>

      <title>Multiplicities and degree functions in local rings via intersection products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a theorem on the intersection theory over a Noetherian local ring $R$, which gives a new proof of a classical theorem of Rees about degree functions. To obtain this, we define an intersection product on schemes that are proper and birational over such rings $R$, using the theory of rational equivalence developed by Thorup, and the Snapper-Mumford-Kleiman intersection theory for proper schemes over an Artinian local ring. Our development of this product is essentially self-contained. As a central component of the proof of our main theorem, we extend to arbitrary Noetherian local rings a formula by Ramanujam that computes Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities. In the final section, we express mixed multiplicities in terms of intersection theory and conclude from this that they satisfy a certain multilinearity condition. Then we interpret some theorems of Rees and Sharp and of Teissier about mixed multiplicities over $2$-dimensional excellent local rings in terms of our intersection product.</description>

      <title>Integral transforms on singularity categories for Noetherian schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies conditions under which integral transforms induce exact functors on singularity categories between schemes that are proper over a Noetherian base scheme. A complete characterization for this behavior is provided, which extends earlier work of Ballard and Rizzardo. We leverage a description of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves as finite cohomological functors on the category of perfect complexes, which is an application of Neeman's approximable triangulated categories, to reduce arguments to an affine local setting. Moreover, we study adjoints of such functors, extend a result of Olander to varieties with mild singularities, and provide an obstruction for derived equivalences between singular varieties.</description>
