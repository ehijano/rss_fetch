      <title>Entropy Evolution Towards DARKexp of IllustrisTNG Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) halos simulated via N-body techniques are known to exhibit nearly universal profiles at equilibrium; however, their origin remains uncertain despite thorough investigation. This work aims to probe the origin of simulated DM halo structure by testing DARKexp, a first-principles approach that describes the maximum entropy state of collisionless, self-gravitating systems in equilibrium via their energy distributions, and proposes an entropy functional that is expected to increase during evolution. We fit the DARKexp energy distribution to a set of massive equilibrium halos from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. For the first time, we calculate the entropy of these halos as a function of cosmological time by tracking halos that are in equilibrium at z = 0.0, to z = 3.0 and calculating their entropy at various epochs between. We find that DARKexp provides an excellent fit to the energy distributions of equilibrium DM halos and that such halos exhibit an overall increase in entropy during evolution. Our results indicate that DM halos evolve to become their maximum entropy state at equilibrium and that this state is described by DARKexp.</description>

      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. III. Refining the HST Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distance Scale Calibration with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRGB-SBF Project team is developing an independent distance ladder using a geometrical calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in elliptical galaxies that can in turn be used to set the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale independent of Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. In this paper, we use JWST TRGB distances calibrated using the megamaser galaxy NGC 4258 to determine a new Cepheid-independent SBF zero point for HST. This new calibration, along with improved optical color measurements from PanSTARRS and DECam, gives an updated value of the Hubble-Lemaitre constant $H_0 = 73.8 \pm 0.7 \pm 2.3$ km/s/Mpc that is virtually identical to the previously published result based on SBF distances calibrated using Cepheids (Blakeslee et al. 2021, arxiv:2101.02221). Future improvements in the geometrical calibration of TRGB and additions to the HST SBF survey will further reduce the random and systematic uncertainties on $H_0$ measured using the extensive HST WFC3/IR SBF dataset. JWST observations of the Coma cluster will soon establish a foundation for the SBF calibration that will extend to much larger distances than is possible with HST.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in Realistic Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive black hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW) detection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current Bayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by modeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated binary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these datasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, matched filter detection statistic, and reduced log-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the injected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection fractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors &gt;10 favoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.6. Source confusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false detections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations consistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of these CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 nHz and 10.8 nHz), with 95 percentile regions spanning 4nHz-12nHz frequencies, $7-20\times10^9 M_\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and 18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful detections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the chirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower than 1 dex.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Dark Energy Models with $\Lambda$ as an Equilibrium Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a dynamical reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state parameter by assuming that it satisfies a law of motion described by an autonomous second-order differential equation, with the limit of the cosmological constant as an equilibrium point. We determine the asymptotic solutions of this equation and use them to construct two families of parametric dark energy models, employing both linear and logarithmic parametrizations with respect to the scale factor. We perform observational constraints by using the Supernova, the Cosmic Chronometers and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. The constraint parameters are directly related with the initial value problem for the law of motion and its algebraic properties. The analysis shows that most of the models fit the observational data well with a preference to the models of the logarithmic parametrization. Furthermore, we introduce a new class of models as generalizations of the CPL model, for which the equilibrium point is a constant value rather than the cosmological constant. These models fit the data in a similar or better way to the CPL and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion-Flow models for generating 3D cosmic density fields: applications to f(R) cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost, thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses</description>

      <title>Unbiased estimates of the shapes of haloes using the positions of satellite galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shapes of dark matter haloes are sensitive to both cosmology and baryon physics, but are difficult to measure observationally. A promising way to constrain them is to use the positions of satellite galaxies as tracers of the underlying dark matter, but there are typically too few galaxies per halo for reliable shape estimates, resulting in biased shapes. We present a method to model sampling noise to correct for the shape bias. We compare our predicted median shape bias with that obtained from the FLAMINGO suite of simulations and find reasonable agreement. We check that our results are robust to resolution effects and baryonic feedback. We also explore the validity of our bias correction at various redshifts and we discuss how our method might be applied to observations in the future. We show that median projected halo axis ratios are on average biased low by 0.31 when they are traced by only 5 satellites. Using the satellite galaxies, the projected host halo axis ratio can be corrected with a residual bias of ~ 0.1, by accounting for sampling bias. Hence, about two-thirds of the projected axis ratio bias can be explained by sampling noise. This enables the statistical measurement of halo shapes at lower masses than previously possible. Our method will also allow improved estimates of halo shapes in cosmological simulations using fewer particles than currently required.</description>

      <title>Robust cosmic shear with small-scale nulling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard cosmological weak lensing analyses using cosmic shear are inevitably sensitive to small-scale, non-linear clustering from low-redshift structures. The need to adequately model the clustering of matter on this non-linear regime, accounting for both gravitational and baryonic effects, adds significant uncertainty to weak lensing studies, particularly in the context of near-future Stage-IV datasets. In this paper, inspired by previous work on so-called ``nulling'' techniques, we present a general method that selects the linear combinations of a given tomographic cosmic shear dataset that are least sensitive to small-scale non-linearities, by essentially suppressing the contribution from low-redshift structures. We apply this method to the latest public cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey, DES-Y3, that corresponds to 3 years of observation, and show: a) that a large fraction of the signal is dominated by the single mode that is most affected by non-linear scales, and b) that removing this mode leads to a $\sim1\sigma$ upwards shift in the preferred value of $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_M/0.3}$, alleviating the tension with current CMB data. However, the removal of the most contaminated mode also results in a significant increase in the statistical uncertainties. Taking this into account, we find this shift to be compatible with a random fluctuation caused by removing this most-contaminated mode at the $\sim1.4\sigma$ level. We also show that this technique may be used by future Stage-IV surveys to mitigate the sensitivity of the final constraints to baryonic effects, trading precision for robustness.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model, without the need for additional mechanisms. The recent DESI data, which supports the possibility of dynamical dark energy, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model. While this analysis serves as a first step in testing the scenario, we emphasize the importance of considering this effect, as it is naturally expected to be present and could offer valuable insights in light of the recent observational data.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in the context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at frequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly de-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they differ under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics amplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one, especially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the amplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be considerably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\sim}100\:{\rm M_\odot}-200\:{\rm M_\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at frequencies ${\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics which may help us distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Physics Benchmark (TPBench) -- a Dataset and Study of AI Reasoning Capabilities in Theoretical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the capability of AI to solve problems in theoretical physics, focusing on high-energy theory and cosmology. The first iteration of our benchmark consists of 57 problems of varying difficulty, from undergraduate to research level. These problems are novel in the sense that they do not come from public problem collections. We evaluate our data set on various open and closed language models, including o3-mini, o1, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o and versions of Llama and Qwen. While we find impressive progress in model performance with the most recent models, our research-level difficulty problems are mostly unsolved. We address challenges of auto-verifiability and grading, and discuss common failure modes. While currently state-of-the art models are still of limited use for researchers, our results show that AI assisted theoretical physics research may become possible in the near future. We discuss the main obstacles towards this goal and possible strategies to overcome them. The public problems and solutions, results for various models, and updates to the data set and score distribution, are available on the website of the dataset tpbench.org.</description>

      <title>EMBER-2: Emulating baryons from dark matter across cosmic time with deep modulation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy formation is a complex problem that connects large scale cosmology with small scale astrophysics over cosmic timescales. Hydrodynamical simulations are the most principled approach to model galaxy formation, but have large computational costs. Recently, emulation techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to predict baryonic properties directly from dark matter simulations. The advantage of these emulators is their ability to capture relevant correlations, but at a fraction of the computational cost compared to simulations. However, training basic CNNs over large redshift ranges is challenging, due to the increasing non-linear interplay between dark matter and baryons paired with the memory inefficiency of CNNs. This work introduces EMBER-2, an improved version of the EMBER (EMulating Baryonic EnRichment) framework, to simultaneously emulate multiple baryon channels including gas density, velocity, temperature and HI density over a large redshift range, from z=6 to z=0. EMBER-2 incorporates a context-based styling network paired with Modulated Convolutions for fast, accurate and memory efficient emulation capable of interpolating the entire redshift range with a single CNN. Although EMBER-2 uses fewer than 1/6 the number of trainable parameters than the previous version, the model improves in every tested summary metric including gas mass conservation and cross-correlation coefficients. The EMBER-2 framework builds the foundation to produce mock catalogues of field level data and derived summary statistics that can directly be incorporated in future analysis pipelines. We release the source code at the official website https://maurbe.github.io/ember2/.</description>

      <title>Addressing the core-cusp and diversity problem of dwarf and disk galaxies using cold collisionless DARKexp theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed dwarf galaxies tend to have linearly rising rotation curves, which indicate flat density cores in their centers. Furthermore, disk galaxies show a wide range of rotation curves shapes. High resolution simulations of cold collisionless dark matter do not reproduce flat central profiles, or the observed diversity of rotation curve shapes; even hydrodynamic simulations incorporating baryonic feedback cannot do that robustly. However, numerical simulations are not the only way to make predictions about density profiles of equilibrium dark matter halos. A theoretical model based on statistical mechanics shows that maximum entropy solutions for cold collisionless self-gravitating dark matter halos can have a range of inner density profiles, including flat density cores. These theoretical profiles, called DARKexp, have only one shape parameter, and are able to fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies with last measured velocities in the range ~20-200 km/s. Here we present fits to 96 SPARC catalog galaxies, and the Milky Way. DARKexp also provides good fits to the projected stellar density distributions of ultrafaint dwarfs that show cores, suggesting that the dark matter halo hosts could have flat density cores. Thus, DARKexp appears to be able to address the core-cusp problem and the diversity of rotation curves with cold collisionless dark matter alone, without baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO XIX: Measuring stellar velocity dispersion with sub-percent accuracy for cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of massive elliptical galaxies is a key ingredient to breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and obtaining precise and accurate cosmography from gravitational time delays. The relative uncertainty on the Hubble constant H$_0$ is double the relative error on $\sigma$. Therefore, time-delay cosmography imposes much more demanding requirements on the precision and accuracy of $\sigma$ than galaxy studies. While precision can be achieved with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), accuracy depends critically on factors such as elemental abundances and temperature of stellar templates, flux calibration, and wavelength ranges. We carry out a detailed study of the problem using multiple sets of galaxy spectra of massive elliptical galaxies with SNR$\sim$30-160 \AA$^{-1}$, and state-of-the-art empirical and semi-empirical stellar libraries and stellar population synthesis templates. We show that the choice of stellar library is generally the dominant source of residual systematic error. We propose a general recipe to mitigate and account for residual uncertainties. We show that sub-percent accuracy can be achieved on individual spectra with our data quality. Covariance between velocity dispersions measured for a sample of spectra can also be reduced to sub-percent levels. We recommend this recipe for all applications that require high precision and accurate stellar kinematics, and make all software publicly available to facilitate its implementation. This recipe will be used in future TDCOSMO collaboration papers.</description>

      <title>Calculating the EFT likelihood via saddle-point expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the functional approach for calculating the EFT likelihood by applying the saddle-point expansion. We demonstrate that, after suitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path integral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In contrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point expansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the treatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at the saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood calculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through the combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. Gaussian distribution as a working example, we then concentrate on the calculation of the EFT likelihood and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood via saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise computation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby enabling more reliable theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi method in reheating predictions for non-minimal coupling inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi method offers a natural and concise framework for describing inflation, with implications that extend to the reheating phase. Additionally, reheating plays a crucial role in constraining the observationally viable parameter space of inflationary models. In this study, we employ the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to investigate reheating predictions within non-minimally coupled inflation models, comparing the metric and Palatini formulations. Our results show that the coupling effect suppresses the tensor-to-scalar ratio, aligning predictions with the Planck CMB and BICEP/Keck data in both formulations. Additionally, reheating predictions in the Palatini formulation are more sensitive to coupling strength variations, leading to a stronger suppression of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This highlights a key difference in reheating dynamics between the metric and Palatini formulations.</description>

      <title>On the maximal velocity of colliding galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current galaxy formation paradigm, collisions play a crucial role. A fraction of galaxy collisions results in flyby events, and a galaxy that has passed through another galaxy is called a backsplash galaxy. Such flyby events are of particular interest for explaining the quenching of isolated galaxies. One signature of backsplash galaxies is that they have high velocities relative to their environment, since they do not move in the same flow as surrounding galaxies. This feature can be studied in simulations, but it is also useful to have a theory that can predict the velocities of backsplash galaxies. In this paper, we develop such a theory based on the Zel'dovich approximation and use it to determine the maximal expected velocity of a backsplash galaxy in a given volume.</description>

Abstract: Assuming that (1) the universe underwent a post-inflationary accelerated expansion phase driven by a fluid with equation of state $P=w\rho$ and $-1&lt;w&lt;-1/3$, that (2) the cosmic horizon in an accelerating, quasi-de Sitter universe has a temperature inversely proportional to the proper size of the horizon, and that (3) we are static observers, we calculate the frozen-in density of a stable particle of mass $m$ produced by the cosmic horizon that does not undergo any number-changing processes in the late universe. We find that, as a function of the equation of state and the temperature when radiation domination starts and the quasi-de Sitter phase ends, the mass of the dark matter producing the observed cosmological abundance via this mechanism ranges from 10 keV up to close to the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Dark Baryon Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a novel mechanism for dark matter production through the formation of light black holes from the collapse of dark baryons in confining SU(N) gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. While glueballs and mesons cannot form black holes under physically reasonable conditions, we prove that for appropriate ranges of the confinement scale, quark masses, number of colors $N$, and dark sector temperature, dark baryons can produce Planck-scale black hole relics in the early universe. Assuming the relics are stable, the abundance of both the dark baryon black hole population directly arising at confinement and that frozen in from dark glueball and meson pair annihilation are exponentially suppressed in $N$, leading to an upper limit $N\lesssim 100$ and of a few hundreds Planck units in mass for models where the black hole relics are the entirety of the dark matter. We present a detailed numerical study of the parameter space where this scenario is realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of an early matter-dominated era in cosmic history on the dynamics of cosmic strings and the resulting stochastic gravitational waves. Specifically, we examine the case where this era originates from the dark matter dilution mechanism within the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equations governing the energy densities of the relevant components, we meticulously analyze the modifications to the cosmological scale factor, the number density of cosmic string loops, and the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results reveal that the early matter-dominated era causes a characteristic suppression in the high-frequency regime of the gravitational wave spectrum, providing distinct and testable signatures for future ground-based interferometer experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraining a scalar dark matter component through anomalous stellar light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)] a baryogenesis scenario was proposed where our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk. This model introduced a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, it is shown that this boson can exist today as a relic from the Big Bang and constitute a minor dark matter component. Additionally, one identifies a one-loop process that allows for a non-zero, albeit very small, photon-boson scattering amplitude. One explores this phenomenon and suggests that observations of a subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could constrain the properties of the scalar boson. These constraints would, in turn, provide valuable insights into the parameters of the proposed baryogenesis model.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves: Model effects on time evolution and spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the detection of gravitational waves (GW) in recent years, many papers that use simulated GW datasets to constrain dark energy models have been published. However, these works generally consider GW generated by massive astrophysical objects, such as mergers of black holes or neutron stars. In this paper, we analyse the evolution and spectrum of GW generated in the inflationary epoch, assuming a standard slow-roll single-field inflationary scenario. Three models for the background are considered: a field theory model of interacting dark energy - the Interacting Holographic Tachyonic Model, the Holographic Dark Energy Model, and the {\Lambda}CDM. The results show significant dependence on the cosmological model, especially for the spectrum, and in particular show that an interaction between dark energy and dark matter can leave a significant imprint. Therefore, future primordial gravitational waves (PGW) datasets could be very useful for constraining dark energy models, including to probe an interaction in the dark sector of the universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Particle Production without Quantum Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a cosmological setting, particle production is ubiquitous. It may occur as a consequence of the expansion of the background or because a field couples to other degrees of freedom that evolve with time. The process is well understood in the context of quantum field theory, and calculable as long as the produced quanta are weakly interacting. For extended objects like strings and membranes a second quantized formulation is much less developed than for particles. In this light, we revisit particle production from a first quantized perspective. We show how to obtain occupation numbers, both from the vacuum persistence amplitude and from the Green's function. We also derive the much less studied but phenomenologically interesting two-particle wavefunction of the produced quanta.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parameterized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} [1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]^{-1}$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that the singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime for the perfectly resolved case $\alpha &gt; 1$. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including \alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Gray-body factors: Method matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify the shot noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than two orders of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range, provided it has sufficient sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

      <title>The Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect: unWISE and Planck constraints on Dynamical Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CMB photons redshift and blueshift as they move through gravitational potentials $\Phi$ while propagating across the Universe. If the potential is not constant in time, the photons will pick up a net redshift or blueshift, known as the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. In the $z \ll 1000$ universe, $\dot{\Phi}$ is nonzero on large scales when the Universe transitions from matter to dark energy domination. This effect is only detectable in cross-correlation with large-scale structure at $z \sim 1$. In this paper we present a 3.2$\sigma$ detection of the ISW effect using cross-correlations between unWISE infrared galaxies and Planck CMB temperature maps. We use 3 tomographic galaxy samples spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, allowing us to fully probe the dark energy domination era and the transition into matter domination. This measurement is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM ($A_{\rm ISW} = 0.96 \pm 0.30$). We study constraints on a particular class of dynamical dark energy models (where the dark energy equation of state is different in matter and dark energy domination), finding that unWISE-ISW improves constraints from type Ia supernovae due to improved constraints on the time evolution of dark energy. When combining with BAO measurements, we obtain the tightest constraints on specific dynamical dark energy models. In the context of a phenomenological model for freezing quintessence, the Mocker model, we constrain the dark energy density within 10% at $z &lt; 2$ using ISW, BAO and supernovae. Moreover, the ISW measurement itself provides an important independent check when relaxing assumptions about the theory of gravity, as it is sensitive to the gravitational potential rather than the expansion history.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Time Physics -- On the relation between cosmological redshift and fine structure constant variation</title>

Abstract: Almost a century ago, Hubble discovered the cosmological redshift of extragalactic objects. The Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric was presented as a solution of Einstein's field equations for a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The metric includes a time-dependent factor a(t), intended to explain the cosmological redshift. By contrast, for the Eintein's static universe (a=1), no reasonable redshift explanation was found. In this work, the Cosmic Time Physics (CTP) theoretical framework is developed. CTP moves the explanation of cosmological redshift from general relativity to electromagnetism domain. We show that the vacuum electric permittivity $\epsilon_0$ and the vacuum magnetic permeability $\mu_0$ can vary inversely one each other over cosmic time, maintaining the speed of light $c$ constant, while conducting the change on the vacuum impedance $Z_0$ and on the fine structure constant $\alpha$. This variation downscales the atomic energy levels with cosmic backtime, redshifting the wavelength and frequency exactly in the same manner they are observed, while maintaining the atomic quantification relations. Note that the increase on $\alpha$ with cosmic time has gone unnoticed experimentally so far since the search is performed on rest-frame (de-redshiftted signals), in spite of the manifestation of such variation is precisely the redshift. The application of CTP to general relativity drive to an angular-redshift relation $d_A(z)$ as a function of the age of the universe $t_0$ and its curvature $R_0$. As a first approximation, we show that CTP $d_A(z)$ is able to reproduce the LCDM $d_A(z)$ curve with $R_0=1800$ Mpc and $t_0=15.57$ Gly. Finally, the Friedmann equations without scale factor ($a=1$) are used to derive the requirements for the stability of CTP universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of pairwise motions in the fully non-linear regime in LCDM and Modified Gravity cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to our understanding of density field tracers, the modelling of direct statistics pertaining to the cosmic velocity field remains open to significant opportunities for improvement. The lack of accurate modelling for the non-linear domain of pairwise velocities restricts our capacity to fully exploit the information encoded in this observable. We present a robust approach for modelling the mean infall velocities, $v_{12}(r,a)$, with broad applicability spanning sub-megaparsec scales and cosmologies extending beyond the standard LCDM paradigm. Our approach involves solving the full pair-conservation equation using accurate non-linear power spectrum descriptions. To assess the robustness of our model, we extend it to cosmologies beyond the standard LCDM, in particular, the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$-gravity and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) modified gravity models. Remarkably, our predictions for pairwise velocities of dark matter particles at kilo-parsec scales exhibit excellent agreement with N-body simulations throughout the entire dynamical range ($0.1 \lesssim \xi \lesssim 1000$, or $r\geq0.4$Mpc/h). Furthermore, we show that different gravity models leave distinct signatures in the shape and dynamics of the mean pairwise velocities, providing a potent test of cosmological gravity laws.</description>

      <title>A new method to determine $H_0$ from cosmological energy-density measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for measuring the Hubble parameter from low-redshift large-scale observations that is independent of the comoving sound horizon. The method uses the baryon-to-photon ratio determined by the primordial deuterium abundance, together with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations and the present-day CMB temperature to determine the physical baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$. The baryon fraction $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$ is measured using the relative amplitude of the baryonic signature in galaxy clustering measured by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, scaling the physical baryon density to the physical matter density. The physical density $\Omega_mh^2$ is then compared with the geometrical density $\Omega_m$ from Alcock-Paczynski measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and voids, to give $H_0$. Including type Ia supernovae and uncalibrated BAO, we measure $H_0 = 67.1^{+6.3}_{-5.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We find similar results when varying analysis choices, such as measuring the baryon signature from the reconstructed correlation function, or excluding supernovae or voids. This measurement is currently consistent with both the distance-ladder and CMB $H_0$ determinations, but near-future large-scale structure surveys will obtain 3--4$\times$ tighter constraints.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations analyses with Density-Split Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling for the evolution of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is essential for using it as a standard ruler to probe cosmology. We explore the non-linearity of the BAO in different environments using the density-split statistics and compare them to the case of the conventional two-point correlation function (2PCF). We detect density-dependent shifts for the position of the BAO with respect to its linear version using halos from N-body simulations. Around low/high-densities, the scale of the BAO expands/contracts due to non-linear peculiar velocities. As the simulation evolves from redshift 1 to 0, the difference in the magnitude of the shifts between high- and low-dense regions increases from the sub-percent to the percent level. The width of the BAO around high density regions increases as the universe evolves, similar to the known broadening of the BAO in the 2PCF due to non-linear evolution. In contrast, the width is smaller and stable for low density regions. We discuss possible implications for the reconstructions of the BAO in light of our results.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with voids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voids are dominant features of the cosmic web. We revisit the cosmological information content of voids and connect void properties with the parameters of the background universe. We combine analytical results with a suite of large n-body realizations of large-scale structure in the quasilinear regime to measure the central density and radial outflow of voids. These properties, estimated from multiple voids that span a range of redshifts, provide estimates of the Hubble parameter, $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$. The analysis assumes access to the full phase-space distribution of mass within voids, a dataset that is not currently observable. The observable properties of the largest void in the universe may also test models. The suite of large n-body realizations enables construction of lightcones reaching ~3,000 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Based on these lightcones, we show that large voids similar to those observed are expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Test of the Cosmic Anisotropy with Inverse Distance Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If the Universe is endowed with cosmic anisotropy, it will have a preferred direction of expansion. Reconstructing the expansion history by Gaussian Process (GP) can be used to probe the cosmic anisotropy model-independently. In this paper, for the luminosity distance $d_L(z)$ reconstruction, we turn to the inverse distance ladder, where type Ia supernova (SNIa) from the Pantheon+ sample determine relative distances and strongly gravitationally lensed quasars from H0LiCOW sample anchor these relative distances with some absolute distance measurements. By isolating the anisotropic information that could be carried by the Hubble constant $H_0$ and obtaining constraints on the intrinsic parameter of SNIa, the absolute magnitude $M=-19.2522^{+0.0594}_{-0.0649}$ (at $68\%$ CL), we find that $d_L(z)$ reconstructions from samples located in different region of the Galactic coordinate system are almost consistent with each other, while only a very weak preference for the cosmic anisotropy is found.</description>

      <title>Infrared Sensitivity of Cosmological Probes In The Presence of Axion Field Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of long wavelength entropy fluctuations on cosmological probes such as galaxy clustering, luminosity distance, and CMB temperature anisotropies. Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator scalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the radiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on observables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at the time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\eta^{-2}$ where $\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important for CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed. In particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble tension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a lot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than momentum space.</description>

      <title>Simulating realistic self-interacting dark matter models including small and large-angle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) self-interactions alter the matter distribution on galactic scales and alleviate tensions with observations. A feature of the self-interaction cross section is its angular dependence, influencing offsets between galaxies and DM halos in merging galaxy clusters. While algorithms for modelling mostly forward-dominated or mostly large-angle scatterings exist, incorporating realistic angular dependencies, such as light mediator models, within $N$-body simulations remains challenging. We develop, validate and apply a novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small- and large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical angle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse momentum diffusion is used, while above the angle dependence is sampled explicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known analytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice of the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our scheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic light mediator models. Finally, we apply the method to galaxy cluster mergers and discuss the sensitivity of the offset between galaxies and DM to the angle dependence of the cross section. Our scheme ensures accurate offsets for mediator mass $m_\phi$ and DM mass $m_\chi$ within the range $0.1v/c\lesssim m_\phi/m_\chi\lesssim v/c$, while for larger (smaller) mass ratios the offsets obtained for isotropic (forward-dominated) self-scattering are approached. Here $v$ is the typical velocity scale. Equivalently, the upper condition can be expressed as $1.1\lesssim \sigma_{\rm tot}/\sigma_{\mathrm{\widetilde{T}}}\lesssim 10$ for the ratio of the total and momentum transfer cross sections, with the ratio being $1$ ($\infty$) in the isotropic (forward-dominated) limits.</description>

Abstract: The recent tension in the value of the cosmological parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_M/0.3)^{1/2}$, which represents the amplitude of the matter density fluctuations of the universe, has not been resolved. In this work, we present constraints on $S_8$ with the X-ray angular power spectra of clusters and groups measured with the half-sky map from the eROSITA All Sky Survey data release 1 (eRASS1). Thanks to the extensive sky coverage of eRASS1, it achieves unprecedented precision compared to previous power spectrum measurements. Using a well-calibrated, physical halo gas model that includes astrophysics of feedback and non-thermal pressure support, we obtain $S_8 = 0.80^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ with 1$\sigma$ uncertainty that is competitive against other cosmological probes. Our derived $S_8$ value is smaller than the primary CMB measurements from {\em Planck}, but still consistent to within $1\sigma$. We also obtain constraints on the astrophysics of feedback, non-thermal pressure, equation of state in cluster cores, and outer boundaries of gas in clusters and groups. We discuss how additional X-ray observations, and cosmological surveys in microwave and optical, will further improve the cosmological constraints with the angular power spectrum. Our work demonstrates that the angular power spectrum of clusters and groups is a promising probe of both cosmology and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ''$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would drastically alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would lead make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments cast severe doubt on the viability of the GSM: the solution to the Hubble tension should be sought elsewhere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$ and an additional 51 galaxies at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 II: radio analysis of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>

Abstract: We report upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Karl J. Jansky Very Large Array radio observations of a low-mass merging galaxy cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. This exceptional galaxy cluster hosts two megaparsec-scale diffuse sources, symmetrically located with respect to the cluster center and separated by about 2.6 Mpc in projection. We detect these low surface brightness sources in our new high-frequency observations (0.3-2 GHz) and classify them as radio relics associated with merger-driven shock fronts. The southwest relic exhibits an inverted morphology and shows evidence of spectral steepening in the post-shock region, potentially tracing a high Mach number shock ($\sim 4$) under the framework of diffusive shock acceleration. The northeast relic is found to be highly polarized with a 22% average polarization fraction at 1.5 GHz and aligned magnetic field vectors. Its spectral and polarization properties, along with the presence of a nearby tailed galaxy, support re-acceleration scenarios. The merger axis defined by the two relics is tilted by $\sim 45$ degree with respect to the plane of the sky, which implies an unprecedented physical separation of $\sim 3.5$ Mpc. We also detect a possible faint radio halo, suggesting weak turbulence in the central cluster region. We conclude that the faint double relics can be best explained by two outward moving shock waves in which particles are (re-)accelerated and that the cluster is in an evolved merger state. PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 presents a unique opportunity to investigate particle acceleration in low mass systems characterized by large relic separations.</description>

      <title>Sign Switching in Dark Sector Coupling Interactions as a Candidate for Resolving Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations, but is increasingly challenged by the emergence of cosmological tensions, particularly the Hubble Tension $H_0$ and the $S_8$ tension. The Hubble Tension, with a significance above 5$\sigma$, and the $S_8$ tension, showing a discrepancy of approximately 2-4$\sigma$, highlight inconsistencies between measurements of the local and early universe. This paper expands a well-established Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) phenomenological scenario, where dark matter (DM) can transfer energy to dark energy (DE) or vice versa, depending on the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. The novel feature consists in a transition mechanism which reverses the direction of the energy-momentum transfer after the redshift where the densities of the dark species are the same. We evaluate this model using a comprehensive set of recent observational data, including Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the DESI survey, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5 and Union3 samples, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis shows that this scenario can potentially relax both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions simultaneously. We find the new model to be weakly preferred over $\Lambda$CDM by BAO-DESI data. However, we show that the IDE model features positive Bayesian evidence compared to $\Lambda$CDM only when Cepheid distance calibration in the SH0ES sample is used to calibrate SNIa data from PantheonPlus.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical structure of the cosmic web and galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voids possess a very complex internal structure and dynamics. Using $N$-body simulations we study the hierarchical nature of sub-structures present in the cosmic web (CW). We use the SpineWeb method which provides a complete characterization of the CW into its primary constituents: voids, walls, filaments, and nodes. We aim to characterize the inner compositions of voids by detecting their internal filamentary structure and explore the impact of this on the properties of void galaxies. Using a semi-analytical galaxy evolution model we explore the impact of the CW on several galaxies' properties. We find the fraction of haloes living in various CW components to be a function of their mass, with the majority of the haloes of mass below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$, residing in voids and haloes of higher masses distributed mostly in walls. Similarly, in the Stellar-to-Halo mass relationship, we observe an environmental dependence for haloes of masses below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$, showing an increased stellar mass fraction for the densest environments.
  The spin is lower for galaxies in the densest environments for the mass range of $10^{10}-10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$. Finally, we found a strong trend of higher metallicity fractions for filaments and node galaxies, with respect to the full sample, in the range of $M_*&lt;10^{10}M_{\odot}/h$.
  Our results show that cosmic voids possess an intricate internal network of substructures. This in turn makes them a complex environment for galaxy formation, impacting in an unique way the properties and evolution of the chosen few galaxies that form inside them.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Candidates of a Very Low Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review dark matter (DM) candidates of a very low mass, appearing in the window below the traditional weakly-interacting massive particle $m_\chi \lesssim 10$ GeV and extending down to $m_\chi \gtrsim 1$ meV, somewhat below the mass limit where DM becomes wavelike. Such candidates are motivated by hidden sectors such as Hidden Valleys, which feature hidden forces and rich dynamics, but have evaded traditional collider searches looking for New Physics because of their relatively weak coupling to the Standard Model. Such sectors can still be detected through dedicated low-energy colliders which, through their intense beams, can have sensitivity to smaller couplings, or through astrophysical observations of the evolution of DM halos and stellar structures which, through the Universe's epochs, can be sensitive to small DM interactions. We also consider mechanisms where the DM abundance is fixed through the interaction with the SM, which directly motivates the search for light DM in terrestrial experiments. The bulk of this review is dedicated to the new ideas that have been proposed for directly detecting such DM candidates of a low mass, through nuclear recoils, electronic excitations, or collective modes such as phonons and magnons. The rich tapestry of materials and modes in the Condensed Matter landscape is reviewed, along with specific prospects for detection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering in Effective Field Theory: a Scalar Tidal Matching at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravitational analog of the Raman process, a quasi-elastic scattering of waves off compact objects, in worldline effective field theory (EFT). As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our results pave the way for systematic calculations of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the bubble wall velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the bubble wall velocity in first-order phase transitions is a challenging task, requiring the solution of (coupled) equations of motion for the scalar field and Boltzmann equations for the particles in the plasma. The collision terms appearing in the Boltzmann equation present a prominent source of uncertainty as they are often known only at leading log accuracy. In this paper, we derive upper and lower bounds on the wall velocity, corresponding to the local thermal equilibrium and ballistic limits. These bounds are completely independent of the collision terms.
  For the ballistic approximation, we argue that the inhomogeneous plasma temperature and velocity distributions across the bubble wall should be taken into account. This way, the hydrodynamic obstruction previously observed in local thermal equilibrium is also present for the ballistic approximation. This is essential for the ballistic approximation to provide a lower bound on the wall velocity. We use a model-independent approach to study the behaviour of the limiting wall velocities as a function of a few generic parameters, and we test our developments in the singlet extended Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Goldilocks Zone: Identifying Critical Features in Massive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center. These SMBHs can be observed out to high redshifts (z&gt;=6) if the accretion rate is sufficiently large. However, we do not fully understand the mechanism through which these black holes form at early times. The heavy (or direct collapse) seeding mechanism has emerged as a probable contender in which the core of an atomic cooling halo directly collapses into a dense stellar cluster that could host supermassive stars that proceed to form a BH seed of mass ~10^5 M_sun. We use the Renaissance simulations to investigate the properties of 35 DCBH candidate host halos at z=15-24 and compare them to non-candidate halos. We aim to understand what features differentiate halos capable of hosting a DCBH from the general halo population with the use of statistical analysis and machine learning methods. We examine 18 halo, central, and environmental properties. We find that DCBH candidacy is more dependent on a halo's core internal properties than on exterior factors such as Lyman-Werner flux and distance to closest galaxy; our analysis selects density and radial mass influx as the most important features (outside candidacy establishing features). Our results concur with the recent suggestion that DCBH host halos neither need to lie within a "Goldilocks zone" nor have a significant amount of Lyman-Werner flux to suppress cooling. This paper presents insight to the dynamics possibly occurring in potential DCBH host halos and seeks to provide guidance to DCBH subgrid formation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>

      <title>Three-Field String Inflation with Perturbative Corrections: Dynamics and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct an explicit string motivated example of three-field inflation in a related, yet distinct from, the recently discovered perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS). Contrary to the usual constructions, in this set up, large volume is ensured by the interplay between the effects of $\alpha^{\prime 3}$, logarithmic loop and higher derivative $F^4$ corrections. After addressing a full moduli stabilization scenario, we move on to a detailed analysis of three-field model of inflation in a canonical basis. We conduct multiple consistency checks to establish a solid foundation for our model within the framework of the underlying 4D effective field theory (EFT). Our model differs from previous setups in three key aspects: first, the interaction between subleading corrections that drive full moduli stabilization follows a different pattern, second, the volume form of the underlying Calabi-Yau is different, and third, in our three-field inflation scenario, the second slow-roll parameter consistently dominates over the first by several orders of magnitude. The latter signals the possible presence of primordial features which can be verified by forthcoming ground and space based experiments. We can roughly distinguish two stages of inflation: the first stage mostly occurs in the steepest direction during horizon crossing giving us almost $55$ efolds of inflation -- once one of the inflatons falls off the ridge and then to its true minimum, the other two fields become active, giving us a truly multi-field behavior in the second stage -- adding few more efolds of inflation. We also confirm our claim by introducing the non-planar torsion in the inflationary trajectory -- this quantity becomes non-trivial in the second stage of inflation. Finally, we calculate the cosmological observables, which align with Planck data, and discuss potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>
