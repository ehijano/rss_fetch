      <title>How do financial variables impact public debt growth in China? An empirical study based on Markov regime-switching model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep financial turmoil in China caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated fiscal shocks and soaring public debt levels, which raises concerns about the stability and sustainability of China's public debt growth in the future. This paper employs the Markov regime-switching model with time-varying transition probability (TVTP-MS) to investigate the growth pattern of China's public debt and the impact of financial variables such as credit, house prices and stock prices on the growth of public debt. We identify two distinct regimes of China's public debt, i.e., the surge regime with high growth rate and high volatility and the steady regime with low growth rate and low volatility. The main results are twofold. On the one hand, an increase in the growth rate of the financial variables helps to moderate the growth rate of public debt, whereas the effects differ between the two regimes. More specifically, the impacts of credit and house prices are significant in the surge regime, whereas stock prices affect public debt growth significantly in the steady regime. On the other hand, a higher growth rate of financial variables also increases the probability of public debt either staying in or switching to the steady regime. These findings highlight the necessity of aligning financial adjustments with the prevailing public debt regime when developing sustainable fiscal policies.</description>

      <title>Conditional Forecasts in Large Bayesian VARs with Multiple Equality and Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional forecasts, i.e. projections of a set of variables of interest on the future paths of some other variables, are used routinely by empirical macroeconomists in a number of applied settings. In spite of this, the existing algorithms used to generate conditional forecasts tend to be very computationally intensive, especially when working with large Vector Autoregressions or when multiple linear equality and inequality constraints are imposed at once. We introduce a novel precision-based sampler that is fast, scales well, and yields conditional forecasts from linear equality and inequality constraints. We show in a simulation study that the proposed method produces forecasts that are identical to those from the existing algorithms but in a fraction of the time. We then illustrate the performance of our method in a large Bayesian Vector Autoregression where we simultaneously impose a mix of linear equality and inequality constraints on the future trajectories of key US macroeconomic indicators over the 2020--2022 period.</description>

      <title>Large Skew-t Copula Models and Asymmetric Dependence in Intraday Equity Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05564v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skew-t copula models are attractive for the modeling of financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence. We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A stochastic gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The methodology is used to estimate skew-t factor copula models with up to 15 factors for intraday returns from 2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in pairwise correlations. In a moving window study we show that the asymmetric dependencies also vary over time, and that intraday predictive densities from the skew-t copula are more accurate than those from benchmark copula models. Portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise asymmetric dependencies improve performance relative to the index.</description>

      <title>Inference for Rank-Rank Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slope coefficient in a rank-rank regression is a popular measure of intergenerational mobility. In this article, we first show that commonly used inference methods for this slope parameter are invalid. Second, when the underlying distribution is not continuous, the OLS estimator and its asymptotic distribution may be highly sensitive to how ties in the ranks are handled. Motivated by these findings we develop a new asymptotic theory for the OLS estimator in a general class of rank-rank regression specifications without imposing any assumptions about the continuity of the underlying distribution. We then extend the asymptotic theory to other regressions involving ranks that have been used in empirical work. Finally, we apply our new inference methods to two empirical studies on intergenerational mobility, highlighting the practical implications of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Forecasting CPI inflation under economic policy and geopolitical uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting consumer price index (CPI) inflation is of paramount importance for both academics and policymakers at the central banks. This study introduces a filtered ensemble wavelet neural network (FEWNet) to forecast CPI inflation, which is tested on BRIC countries. FEWNet breaks down inflation data into high and low-frequency components using wavelets and utilizes them along with other economic factors (economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk) to produce forecasts. All the wavelet-transformed series and filtered exogenous variables are fed into downstream autoregressive neural networks to make the final ensemble forecast. Theoretically, we show that FEWNet reduces the empirical risk compared to fully connected autoregressive neural networks. FEWNet is more accurate than other forecasting methods and can also estimate the uncertainty in its predictions due to its capacity to effectively capture non-linearities and long-range dependencies in the data through its adaptable architecture. This makes FEWNet a valuable tool for central banks to manage inflation.</description>
