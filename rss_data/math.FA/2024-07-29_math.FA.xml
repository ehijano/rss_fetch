      <title>Essential normality of quotient modules vs. Hilbert-Schmidtness of submodules in $H^2(\mathbb D^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we prove that all the quotient modules in $H^2(\mathbb D^2)$, associated to the finitely generated submodules containing a distinguished homogenous polynomial, are essentially normal, which is the first result on the essential normality of non-algebraic quotient modules in $H^2(\mathbb D^2)$. Moreover, we obtain the equivalence of the essential normality of a quotient module and the Hilbert-Schmidtness of its associated submodule in $H^2(\mathbb D^2)$, in the case that the submodule contains a distinguished homogenous polynomial. As an application, we prove that each finitely generated submodule containing a polynomial is Hilbert-Schmidt, which partially gives an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Yang \cite{Ya3}.</description>

      <title>Unconditional basic sequences in function spaces with applications to Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find conditions on a function space $\bf{L}$ that ensure that it behaves as an $L_p$-space in the sense that any unconditional basis of a complemented subspace of $\bf{L}$ either is equivalent to the unit vector system of $\ell_2$ or has a subbasis equivalent to a disjointly supported basic sequence. This dichotomy allows us to classify the symmetric basic sequences of $\bf{L}$. Several applications to Orlicz function spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>On homogeneous Newton-Sobolev spaces of functions in metric measure spaces of uniformly locally controlled geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale behavior of Newton-Sobolev functions on complete, connected, proper, separable metric measure spaces equipped with a Borel measure $\mu$ with $\mu(X) = \infty$ and $0 &lt; \mu(B(x, r)) &lt; \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r \in (0, \infty)$ Our objective is to understand the relationship between the Dirichlet space $D^{1,p}(X)$, defined using upper gradients, and the Newton-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$, for $1\le p&lt;\infty$. We show that when $X$ is of uniformly locally $p$-controlled geometry, these two spaces do not coincide under a wide variety of geometric and potential theoretic conditions. We also show that when the metric measure space is the standard hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ with $n\ge 2$, these two spaces coincide precisely when $1\le p\le n-1$. We also provide additional characterizations of when a function in $D^{1,p}(X)$ is in $N^{1,p}(X)+\mathbb{R}$ in the case that the two spaces do not coincide.</description>

      <title>Variational Analysis of Generalized Games over Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study generalized games defined over Banach spaces using variational analysis. To reformulate generalized games as quasi-variational inequality problems, we will first form a suitable principal operator and study some significant properties of this operator. Then, we deduce the sufficient conditions under which an equilibrium for the generalized game can be obtained by solving a quasi-variational inequality. Based on this variational reformulation, we derive the existence of equilibrium for generalized games with non-ordered (that is, associated weak preference relations need not be complete and transitive) and mid-point continuous preference maps.</description>

      <title>Quantum Point Charges Interacting with Quasi-classical Electromagnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study effective models describing systems of quantum particles interacting with quantized (electromagnetic) fields in the quasi-classical regime, i.e., when the field's state shows a large average number of excitations. Once the field's degrees of freedom are traced out on factorized states, the reduced dynamics of the particles' system is described by an effective Schr\"{o}dinger operator keeping track of the field's state. We prove that, under suitable assumptions on the latter, such effective models are well-posed even if the particles are point-like, that is no ultraviolet cut-off is imposed on the interaction with quantum fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper a fixed-point solver for mappings from a Simplex into itself that is gradient-free, global and requires $\binom{d+1}{ 2}$ function evaluations for halvening the error is presented. It is based on topological arguments and uses the constructive proof of the Mazurkewicz-Knaster-Kuratowski lemma when used as part of the proof for Brouwers Fixed-Point theorem.</description>

      <title>Wiener pairs of Banach algebras of operator-valued matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we introduce several new examples of Wiener pairs $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{B}(\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H}))$ is the Banach algebra of bounded operators acting on the Hilbert space-valued Bochner sequence space $\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}(X)$ is a Banach algebra consisting of operator-valued matrices indexed by some relatively separated set $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we introduce $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$-valued versions of the Jaffard algebra, of certain weighted Schur-type algebras, of Banach algebras which are defined by more general off-diagonal decay conditions than polynomial decay, of weighted versions of the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sj\"ostrand algebra, and of anisotropic variations of all of these matrix algebras, and show that they are inverse-closed in $\mathcal{B}(\ell^2(X;\mathcal{H}))$. In addition, we obtain that each of these Banach algebras is symmetric.</description>

      <title>A Class of Quasi-Variational Inequalities with Unbounded Constraint Maps: Existence Results and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-variational inequalities play a significant role in analyzing a wide range of real-world problems. However, these problems are more complicated to solve than variational inequalities as the constraint set is based on the current point. We study a class of quasi-variational inequality problems whose specific structure is beneficial in finding some of its solutions by solving a corresponding variational inequality problem. Based on the classical existence theorem for variational inequalities, our main results ensure the occurrence of solutions for the aforementioned class of quasi-variational inequalities in which the associated constraint maps are (possibly) unbounded. We employ a coercivity condition which plays a crucial role in obtaining these results. Finally, we apply our existence results to ensure the occurrence of equilibrium for the pure exchange economic problems and the jointly convex generalized Nash games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rate of convergence of the classical Thresholding Greedy Algorithm with respect to bases is studied in this paper. We bound the error of approximation by the product of both norms -- the norm of $f$ and the $A_1$-norm of $f$. We obtain some results for greedy bases, unconditional bases, and quasi-greedy bases. In particular, we prove that our bounds for the trigonometric basis and for the Haar basis are optimal.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi--Sobolev Inequalities and Connections to Spectral Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the log-Sobolev inequalities to R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities by replacing the entropy with the two-parameter entropy, which is a generalized version of entropy and closely related to R\'enyi divergences. We derive the sharp nonlinear dimension-free version of this kind of inequalities. Interestingly, the resultant inequalities show a transition phenomenon depending on the parameters. We then connect R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities to contractive and data-processing inequalities, concentration inequalities, and spectral graph theory. Our proofs in this paper are based on the information-theoretic characterization of the R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities, as well as the method of types.</description>

      <title>Sharp Sobolev inequalities on noncompact Riemannian manifolds with ${\sf Ric}\geq 0$ via Optimal Transport theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Cordero-Erausquin, Nazaret and Villani [Adv. Math., 2004] proved sharp Sobolev inequalities in Euclidean spaces via Optimal Mass Transportation, raising the question whether their approach is powerful enough to produce sharp Sobolev inequalities also on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper we affirmatively answer their question for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature; namely, by using Optimal Mass Transportation with quadratic distance cost, sharp $L^p$-Sobolev and $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (both for $p&gt;1$ and $p=1$) are established, where the optimal constants contain the asymptotic volume growth arising from precise asymptotic properties of the Talentian and Gaussian bubbles. As a byproduct, we give an alternative, elementary proof to the main result of do Carmo and Xia [Compos. Math., 2004] (and subsequent results) concerning the quantitative volume non-collapsing estimates on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature that support certain Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the random matrix solution to the Peterson-Thom conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show various new structural properties of free group factors using the recent resolution (due independently to Belinschi-Capitaine and Bordenave-Collins) of the Peterson-Thom conjecture. These results include the resolution to the coarseness conjecture independently due to the first-named author and Popa, a generalization of Ozawa-Popa's celebrated strong solidity result using vastly more general versions of the normalizer (and in an ultraproduct setting), a dichotomy result for intertwining of maximal amenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors, as well as application to ultraproduct embeddings of nonamenable subalgebras of interpolated free group factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of a generalized thermoelastic system (the so called $\alpha-\beta$ system) with delay in a part of the coupled system. For each case, we prove the well-posedness of the corresponding system using semigroup approach, then under some sufficient conditions we establish some results of exponential and polynomial stability of the system through a frequency-domain approach. The results are applied to concrete examples in thermoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Entropy factorization via curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>
