      <title>Bilinearization and solutions of the fourth-order lattice Gel'fand-Dikii type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive bilinear forms and solutions in Casoratians for some fourth-order lattice Gel'fand-Dikii (lattice GD-4) type equations. These equations were recently formulated from the direct linearization approach and exhibit multidimensionally consistent property in multi-component form. The obtained solitons and Casoratian forms enable us to extend these equations by introducing a parameter $\delta$. These $\delta$-extended lattice GD-4 type equations are still consistent around the cube, and their bilinear forms together with Casoration solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue wave statistics for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs) emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values. Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However, during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in [12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.</description>

      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>
