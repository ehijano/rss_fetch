      <title>Superfluid weight in disordered flat-band superconductors as a competition between localization functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Anderson's theorem, the gap of a time-reversal symmetric weak-coupling superconductor is unaffected by non-magnetic disorder. However, the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be typically vanishing.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the quasi-two-dimensional Dirac nodal line superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest in quantum materials has focused on systems exhibiting both superconductivity and non-trivial band topology as material candidates to realize topological or unconventional superconducting states. So far, superconductivity in most topological materials has been identified as type II. In this work, we present magnetotransport studies on the quasi-two-dimensional type I superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$. Combined ab initio DFT calculations and quantum oscillation measurements confirm that $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ is a Dirac nodal line semimetal in the normal state. The complex Fermi surface morphology is evidenced by the non-monotonic angular dependence of both the quantum oscillation amplitude and the magnetoresistance. Our results establish $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ as a candidate material platform for exploring the interplay between band topology and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic growth of aluminum: structural morphology, optical properties, superconductivity and microwave dielectric loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6 K and compare their behavior with films synthesized at room temperature. We demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the cryogenically grown films.</description>

      <title>Signatures of superconducting Higgs mode in irradiated Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higgs mode, originally proposed in the context of superconductivity, corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. Recent THz-domain optical studies have found signatures consistent with the Higgs mode, but its unambiguous detection is still challenging. We predict that the existence of the Higgs mode can be unambiguously revealed by standard measurements of the transport characteristics in microwave-irradiated asymmetric and transparent Josephson junctions. One signature of the Higgs mode in a Josephson junction is the microwave-induced enhancement of the second harmonic of the equilibrium current-phase relation (at zero DC bias voltage), whose sign differs from its expected value in the absence of the Higgs mode. As the radiation frequency is varied, this enhancement exhibits resonant behavior when the microwave frequency is tuned across the Higgs mass. The second signature that we propose is the enhancement of the second harmonic of the AC Josephson current at finite DC voltage bias, which can be probed in a customary analysis of the Shapiro steps in a microwave-irradiated junction.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors based on NbRe nitride ultrafilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the reactive DC sputtering parameters on the superconducting properties of NbReN ultrathin films was investigated. A detailed study of the current-voltage characteristics of the plasma was performed to optimize the superconducting critical temperature, Tc. The thickness dependence of Tc for the films deposited under different conditions was analyzed down to the ultrathin limit. Optimized films were used to fabricate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors which, at T=3.5 K, show saturated internal detection efficiency (IDE) up to a wavelength of 1301 nm and 95% IDE at 1548 nm with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.</description>

      <title>Phase-induced switching of ferromagnetic insulators in Josephson spin valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in junctions composed of two ferromagnetic insulator/diffusive superconductor bilayers separated by an insulating barrier. By computing the free energy of the system, we identify two distinct contributions: (i) The work performed by a current source to create a supercurrent through the junction, and (ii) an antiferromagnetic coupling between ferromagnetic insulators, mediated by the superconducting condensate across the insulating barrier. The competition between these contributions allows for switching between parallel and antiparallel configurations of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic insulators. We explicitly show that the switching occurs at finite temperatures and for superconducting phase differences satisfying $\pi/2 &lt; \phi &lt; 3\pi/2$. Importantly, this effect can be realized in ferromagnetic insulators with sufficiently large easy-plane anisotropy energy. Using realistic junction parameters, we demonstrate that the switching can be controlled by phase bias and triggered by half-flux-quantum voltage pulses or external magnetic field pulses on the microsecond timescale. These results provide a route towards controllable Josephson-based superconducting memory devices based on EuS/Al heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.</description>

      <title>TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

      <title>Frieze charge-stripes in a correlated kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics, where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave, and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry groups in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electron correlations in kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals \ch{AV3Sb5} (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While \ch{KV3Sb5} and \ch{RbV3Sb5} exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, \ch{CsV3Sb5} manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in \ch{CsV3Sb5} at low pressure.</description>

      <title>Classification of Weyl point trajectories in multi-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase diagram.</description>
