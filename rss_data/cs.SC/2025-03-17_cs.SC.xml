      <title>Deciding Connectivity in Symmetric Semi-Algebraic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-algebraic set is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by a finite collection of polynomial equations and inequalities. In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining whether two points in such a set belong to the same connected component. We focus on the case where the defining equations and inequalities are invariant under the natural action of the symmetric group and where each polynomial has degree at most \( d \), with \( d &lt; n \) (where \( n \) denotes the number of variables). Exploiting this symmetry, we develop and analyze algorithms for two key tasks. First, we present an algorithm that determines whether the orbits of two given points are connected. Second, we provide an algorithm that decides connectivity between arbitrary points in the set. Both algorithms run in polynomial time with respect to \( n \).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Hahn series, one can attach to any linear Mahler equation a basis of solutions at 0 reminiscent of the solutions of linear differential equations at a regular singularity. We show that such a basis of solutions can be produced by using a variant of Frobenius method.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Summation of Multivariate Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic summation as an active research topic of symbolic computation provides efficient algorithmic tools for evaluating and simplifying different types of sums arising from mathematics, computer science, physics and other areas. Most of existing algorithms in symbolic summation are mainly applicable to the problem with univariate inputs. A long-term project in symbolic computation is to develop theories, algorithms and software for the symbolic summation of multivariate functions. This paper will give complete solutions to two challenging problems in symbolic summation of multivariate rational functions, namely the rational summability problem and the existence problem of telescopers for multivariate rational functions. Our approach is based on the structure of Sato's isotropy groups of polynomials, which enables us to reduce the problems to testing the shift equivalence of polynomials. Our results provide a complete solution to the discrete analogue of Picard's problem on differential forms and can be used to detect the applicability of the Wilf-Zeilberger method to multivariate rational functions.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Generation Policy Optimization (CGPO): Nonlinear Programming for Policy Optimization in Mixed Discrete-Continuous MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Constraint-Generation Policy Optimization (CGPO) framework to optimize policy parameters within compact and interpretable policy classes for mixed discrete-continuous Markov Decision Processes (DC-MDP). CGPO can not only provide bounded policy error guarantees over an infinite range of initial states for many DC-MDPs with expressive nonlinear dynamics, but it can also provably derive optimal policies in cases where it terminates with zero error. Furthermore, CGPO can generate worst-case state trajectories to diagnose policy deficiencies and provide counterfactual explanations of optimal actions. To achieve such results, CGPO proposes a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework for optimizing policies in defined expressivity classes (e.g. piecewise linear) and reduces it to an optimal constraint generation methodology that adversarially generates worst-case state trajectories. Furthermore, leveraging modern nonlinear optimizers, CGPO can obtain solutions with bounded optimality gap guarantees. We handle stochastic transitions through chance constraints, providing high-probability performance guarantees. We also present a roadmap for understanding the computational complexities of different expressivity classes of policy, reward, and transition dynamics. We experimentally demonstrate the applicability of CGPO across various domains, including inventory control, management of a water reservoir system, and physics control. In summary, CGPO provides structured, compact and explainable policies with bounded performance guarantees, enabling worst-case scenario generation and counterfactual policy diagnostics.</description>

      <title>New Results on Periodic Golay Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide algorithmic methods for conducting exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs. Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond the currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted exhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \leq 72$ using our methods, while only lengths $v \leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively enumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in general. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation derived in 2013 by Djokovi\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a new method of "multi-level" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in several steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v \leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences where uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence generation inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of orderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of periodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths $v \lt 100$. We demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms by providing the first ever examples of periodic Golay pairs of length $v = 90$. The smallest length for which the existence of periodic Golay pairs is undecided is now $106$.</description>
