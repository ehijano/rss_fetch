      <title>A proof of Onsager's Conjecture for the SQG equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the SQG equation that fail to conserve the Hamiltonian while having the maximal allowable regularity for this property to hold. This result solves the generalized Onsager conjecture on the threshold regularity for Hamiltonian conservation for SQG.</description>

      <title>An Onsager-type theorem for SQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct non-trivial weak solutions $\theta\in C_t^0C_x^{0-}$ to the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equations, which have compact support in time and, thus, violate the conservation of the Hamiltonian. The result is sharp in view of the fact that such a conservation law holds for all weak solutions in the class $C_{t,x}^0 \subset L_{t,x}^3$ (Isett-Vicol, 2015) and resolves the Onsager conjecture for SQG. The construction is achieved by means of a Nash iteration together with the linear decoupling method recently introduced in Giri-Radu (2023).</description>

      <title>Existence, comparison principle and uniqueness for doubly nonlinear anisotropic evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of solutions to the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem associated with a class of doubly nonlinear anisotropic evolution equations. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions to the corresponding Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T)$. Under some assumptions on the Caratheodory vector field we prove a comparison principle and utilize it to obtain a uniqueness result for the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <title>On the interaction of strain and vorticity for solutions of the Navier--Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a new identity for divergence free vector fields, showing that $\left&lt;-\Delta S,\omega\otimes\omega\right&gt;=0$. This identity will allow us to understand the interaction of different aspects of the nonlinearity in the Navier--Stokes equation from the strain and vorticity perspective, particularly as they relate to the depletion of the nonlinearity by advection. We will prove global regularity for the strain-vorticity interaction model equation, a model equation for studying the impact of the vorticity on the evolution of strain which has the same identity for enstrophy growth as the full Navier--Stokes equation. We will also use this identity to obtain several new regularity criteria for the Navier--Stokes equation, one of which will help to clarify the circumstances in which advection can work to deplete the nonlinearity, preventing finite-time blowup.</description>

      <title>A Direct Construction of Solitary Waves for a Fractional Korteweg-de Vries Equation With an Inhomogeneous Symbol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solitary waves for the fractional Korteweg-De Vries type equation $u_t + (\Lambda^{-s}u + u^2)_x = 0$, where $\Lambda^{-s}$ denotes the Bessel potential operator $(1 + |D|^2)^{-\frac{s}{2}}$ for $s \in (0,\infty)$. The approach is to parameterise the known periodic solution curves through the relative wave height. Using a priori estimates, we show that the periodic waves locally uniformly converge to waves with negative tails, which are transformed to the desired branch of solutions. The obtained branch reaches a highest wave, the behavior of which varies with $s$. The work is a generalisation of recent work by Ehrnstr\"om-Nik-Walker, and is as far as we know the first simultaneous construction of small, intermediate and highest solitary waves for the complete family of (inhomogeneous) fractional KdV equations with negative-order dispersive operators. The obtained waves display exponential decay rate as $|x| \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>A note on Landau damping of two-species Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we adopt an approach by Grenier, Nguyen and Rodnianski in \cite{GNR} for studying the nonlinear Landau damping of the two-species Vlasov-Poisson system in the phase space $\mathbb{T}^d_x \times \mathbb{R}^d_v$ with the dimension $d\geq 1$. The main goal is twofold: one is to extend the one-species case to the two-species case where the electron mass is finite and the ion mass is sufficiently large, and the other is to modify the $G$-functional such that it involves the norm in $L^{d+1}$ instead of $L^2$ as well as derivatives up to only the first order.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for a semilinear parabolic system with singular initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(u,v)$ be a solution to the Cauchy problem for a semilinear parabolic system \[ \mathrm{(P)} \qquad \cases{ \partial_t u=D_1\Delta u+v^p\quad &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N\times(0,T),$\\ \partial_t v=D_2\Delta v+u^q\quad &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N\times(0,T),$\\ (u(\cdot,0),v(\cdot,0))=(\mu,\nu) &amp; $\quad\mbox{in}\quad{\mathbb{R}}^N,$ } \] where $N\ge 1$, $T&gt;0$, $D_1&gt;0$, $D_2&gt;0$, $0&lt;p\le q$ with $pq&gt;1$, and $(\mu,\nu)$ is a pair of nonnegative Radon measures or locally integrable nonnegative functions in ${\mathbb R}^N$. In this paper we establish sharp sufficient conditions on the initial data for the existence of solutions to problem~(P) using uniformly local Morrey spaces and uniformly local weak Zygmund type spaces.</description>

      <title>Knudsen boundary layer equations for full ranges of cutoff collision kernels: Maxwell reflection boundary with all accommodation coefficients in [0,1]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Knudsen layer equation imposed on Maxwell reflection boundary condition with full ranges of cutoff collision kernels and accommodation coefficients (i.e., $- 3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \alpha_* \leq 1$, respectively) in the $L^\infty_{x,v}$ framework. Moreover, the solution enjoys the exponential decay $\exp \{- c x^\frac{2}{3 - \gamma} - c |v|^2 \}$ for some $c &gt; 0$. We first verify a so-called Nondissipative lemma to deal with the nondissipative boundary condition. In order to study the general angular cutoff collision kernel $-3 &lt; \gamma \leq 1$, we should introduce a $(x,v)$-mixed weight $\sigma$. Then a so-called spatial-velocity indices iteration approach is developed to shift the higher power $x$-polynomial weights to $|v|$-polynomial weights. We also find a weak macroscopic damping mechanism to avoid adding an artificial damping.</description>

      <title>Global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation for semilinear waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new method to prove both global propagation of analyticity and unique continuation in finite time for solutions of semilinear wave-type equations with analytic nonlinearity. It combines control theory techniques and Galerkin approximation, inspired by Hale-Raugel, to prove that analyticity in time can be propagated for the nonlinear equation from a zone where linear observability holds towards the full space.For semilinear wave equations with Dirichlet boundary condition on a bounded domain, this implies that analyticity can be propagated to the entire domain from a subset $\omega$ that satisfies the geometric control condition. It also implies the unique continuation when the solution is assumed to be zero on $\omega$. When the nonlinearity is assumed to be subcritical and defocusing, we also obtain observability estimates in the optimal time of the geometric control condition.For semilinear plate equations, similar propagation of analyticity is achieved by assuming the controllability of the linear Schr\''odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of layered materials with rigid components in two-slip finite crystal plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is an extension of the result by Christowiak and Kreisbeck (2017), which addresses the Gamma-convergence approach to a homogenization problem for composite materials consisting of two distinct types of parallel layers. In Christowiak et al. (2017), one of the layers of the material undergoes only local rotations while the other allows local rotation and plastic deformation along a single slip system. On the other hand, real materials show an interplay of multiple directions of slip. Here we obtain the Gamma-limit for the problem where the number of slip directions is increased to two. When the slip systems are orthogonal, we derive the full homogenized energy based on generalized convex envelopes of the original energy density. Since these envelopes are not completely known for angles between slip directions differing from the right angle, we present a partial, conditional homogenization result in this general case. The analysis is based on a modification of the classical construction of laminate microstructures but several nontrivial difficulties arise due to nonconvex constraints being present in the composite energy.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness for continuous solutions to 1D hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a geometrical condition on $2\times2$ systems of conservation laws leads to non-uniqueness in the class of 1D continuous functions. This demonstrates that the Liu Entropy Condition alone is insufficient to guarantee uniqueness, even within the mono-dimensional setting. We provide examples of systems where this pathology holds, even if they verify stability and uniqueness for small BV solutions. Our proof is based on the convex integration process. Notably, this result represents the first application of convex integration to construct non-unique continuous solutions in one dimension.</description>

      <title>High-order Uncertain Differential Equation and Its Application to Nuclear Reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order uncertain differential equation (HUDE) was introduced in literature. But the present method to solve a HUDE is incorrect. In this paper, we will rigorously prove some comparion theorems of high-order differential equations, and present a method to solve a family of HUDE, including parameter estimation and hypothesis test. Then an application to nuclear reactor kinetics is given to illustrate the method.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of a Hele-Shaw-like system resulting from an inverse geometry problem formulated through a shape optimization setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we revisit a shape optimization reformulation of a prototypical shape inverse problem and briefly propose a simple yet efficient numerical approach for solving the minimization problem. Second, we examine the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of a classical solution to a Hele-Shaw-like system, derived from the continuous setting of a numerical discretization of the shape optimization reformulation for the shape inverse problem. The analysis is based on the methods developed by G. I. Bizhanova and V. A. Solonnikov in "On Free Boundary Problems for Second Order Parabolic Equations" (Algebra Anal. 12 (6) (2000) 98-139) and also by V. A. Solonnikov in "Lectures on Evolution Free Boundary Problems: Classical Solutions" (Lect. Notes Math., Springer, 2003, pp. 123-175).</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time asymptotic behaviour of a topologically non-trivial network of wave and heat equations. By analysing the simpler wave and the heat networks separately, and then applying recent results for abstract coupled systems, we establish energy decay at the rate $t^{-4}$ as $t\to\infty$ for all classical solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the two-field formulation of the quasi-static Biot's equations by means of the inf-sup theory. For this purpose, we exploit an equivalent four-field formulation of the equations, introducing the so-called total pressure and total fluid content as independent variables. We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. Our stability estimate is two-sided and robust, meaning that the regularity established for the solution matches the regularity requirements for the data and the involved constants are independent of all material parameters. We prove also that additional regularity in space of the data implies, in some cases, corresponding additional regularity in space of the solution. These results are instrumental to the design and the analysis of discretizations enjoying accurate stability and error estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a model for the dynamics of a single species in a one-dimensional heterogeneous environment. The environment consists of two kinds of patches, which are periodically alternately arranged along the spatial axis. We first establish the well-posedness for the Cauchy problem. Next, we give existence and uniqueness results for the positive steady state and we analyze the long-time behavior of the solutions to the evolution problem. Afterwards, based on dynamical systems methods, we investigate the spreading properties and the existence of pulsating traveling waves in the positive and negative directions. It is shown that the asymptotic spreading speed, c * , exists and coincides with the minimal wave speed of pulsating traveling waves in positive and negative directions. In particular, we give a variational formula for c * by using the principal eigenvalues of certain linear periodic eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Grad-Caflisch pointwise decay estimates revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the influential paper \cite{Caflish-1980-CPAM} which was the starting point of the employment of Hilbert expansion method to the rigorous justifications of the fluid limits of the Boltzmann equation, Caflisch discovered an elegant and crucial estimate on each expansion term (Proposition 3.1 in \cite{Caflish-1980-CPAM}). The proof essentially relied on an estimate of Grad \cite{Grad-1963}, which was on the pointwise decay properties of $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$, the pseudo-inverse operator of the linearized Boltzmann collision operator $\mathcal{L}$, for the hard potential collision kernel, i.e. the power $0\leq \gamma\leq 1$. Caflisch's arguments need the exponential version of Grad's estimate. However, Grad's original paper was only on the polynomial decay. In this paper, we revisit and provide a full proof of the Caflisch-Grad type decay estimates and the corresponding applications in the compressible Euler limit of the Boltzmann equaiton. The main novelty is that for the case collision kernel power $-\frac{3}{2}&lt;\gamma\leq 1$, the proof of the pointwise estimate does not use any derivatives. So the potential applications of this estimate could be wider than in the Hilbert expansion. For the completeness of the result, we also prove the almost everywhere pointwise estimate using derivatives for the case $-3&lt;\gamma\leq -\frac{3}{2}$. Furthermore, in the application to fluid limits, $\mathcal{L}^{-1}$ and the derivatives with respect to the parameters (for example, $(t,x)$, this must happen when $\mathcal{L}$ is linearized around local Maxwellian which depends on $(t,x)$) are not commutative. We detailed analyze the estimate of commutators, which was missing in previous literatures of fluid limits of the Boltzmann equation. This estimate is needed in all compressible fluid limits from Boltzmann equation.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a convenient approach to Fourier analysis for the investigation of functions and distributions defined in $\mathbb{T}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$. Our approach involves the utilization of a mixed Fourier transform, incorporating both partial Fourier series on the torus for the initial variables and partial Fourier transform in Euclidean space for the remaining variables. By examining the behaviour of the mixed Fourier coefficients, we achieve a comprehensive characterization of the spaces of fast decaying smooth functions and distributions in this context. Additionally, we apply our results to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the Schwartz global hypoellipticity of a class of differential operators defined on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$, including all constant coefficient first order differential operators.</description>

      <title>The role of the boundary in the existence of blow-up solutions for a doubly critical elliptic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a doubly critical nonlinear elliptic problem with Neumann boundary conditions. The existence of blow-up solutions for this problem is related to the blow-up analysis of the classical geometric problem of prescribing negative scalar curvature $K=-1$ on a domain of $\R^n$ and mean curvature $H=D(n(n-1))^{-1/2}$, for some constant $D&gt;1$, on its boundary, via a conformal change of the metric. Assuming that $n\geq6$ and $D&gt;\sqrt{(n+1)/(n-1)}$, we establish the existence of a positive solution which concentrates around an elliptic boundary point which is a nondegenerate critical point of the original mean curvature.</description>

      <title>Propagation of logarithmic regularity and inviscid limit for the 2D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to study the Cauchy problem for the 2D Euler equations under very low regularity assumptions on the initial datum. We prove propagation of regularity of logarithmic order in the class of weak solutions with $L^p$ initial vorticity, provided that $p\geq 4$. We also study the inviscid limit from the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for vorticity with logarithmic regularity in the Yudovich class, showing a rate of convergence of order $|\log\nu|^{-\alpha/2}$ with $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results, but the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we advocate an alternative view-point that sheds light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model enables a deep connection between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representation theory of Lie algebras as pursued in quantum theory. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. The transferal of outcomes, from finite-dimensional matrices to infinite-dimensional fluids, is then supported by hard-fought results in quantization theory -- the field which describes the limit between quantum and classical physics. We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Waves from Finite Sources Arranged in Line Segments within an Infinite Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the propagation of time-harmonic waves in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant $a = 1$. The sources are positioned along line segments within the lattice. Specifically, we investigate the discrete Helmholtz equation with a wavenumber $k \in \left( 0,2\sqrt{2} \right)$, where input data is prescribed on finite rows or columns of lattice sites. We focus on two main questions: the efficacy of the numerical methods employed in evaluating the Green's function, and the necessity of the cone condition. Consistent with a continuum theory, we employ the notion of radiating solution and establish a unique solvability result and Green's representation formula using difference potentials. Finally, we propose a numerical computation method and demonstrate its efficiency through examples related to the propagation problems in the left-handed two-dimensional inductor-capacitor metamaterial.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation by harmonic polynomials for solving the Dirichlet problem of Laplace's equation on a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in an open disk. The uniqueness of solutions is ensured by the well-known weak maximum principle. We introduce a novel approach to demonstrate the existence of a solution using harmonic polynomials that converge uniformly to a solution. Specifically, we rigorously derive the convergence rate of the harmonic polynomials and show that smoother boundary data and proximity of the target point to the disk's origin accelerate the convergence. Additionally, we obtain uniform estimates for the derivatives of solutions of arbitrary orders, controlled by $L^1$-boundary data. Notably, the constants in our estimates are significantly improved compared to existing results. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced radius of convergence for Taylor's series of the solution at each point in the open disk.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003], which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Vlasov-Poisson plasma by a Particle-In-Cell method based on a Monte Carlo framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system describes the time evolution of a plasma in the so-called collisionless regime. The investigation of a high-temperature plasma that is influenced by an exterior magnetic field is one of the most significant aspects of thermonuclear fusion research. In this paper, we formulate and analyze a kinetic optimal control problem for the Vlasov-Poisson system where the control is represented by an external magnetic field. The main goal of such optimal control problems is to confine the plasma in a certain region in phase space. We first investigate the optimal control problem in terms of mathematical analysis, i.e., we show the existence of at least one global minimizer and we rigorously derive a first-order necessary optimality condition for local minimizers by the adjoint approach. Then, we build a Monte Carlo framework to solve the state equations as well as the adjoint equations by means of a Particle-In-Cell method, and we apply a nonlinear conjugate gradient method to solve the optimization problem. Eventually, we present numerical experiments that successfully validate our optimization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present difference schemes for stochastic transport equations with low-regularity velocity fields. We establish $L^2$ stability and convergence of the difference approximations under conditions that are less strict than those required for deterministic transport equations. The $L^2$ estimate, crucial for the analysis, is obtained through a discrete duality argument and a comprehensive examination of a class of backward parabolic difference schemes.</description>

      <title>Mass equidistribution for Saito-Kurokawa lifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a holomorphic cuspidal Hecke eigenform for $\mathrm{Sp}_4(\mathbb{Z})$ of weight $k$ that is a Saito--Kurokawa lift. Assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), we prove that the mass of $F$ equidistributes on the Siegel modular variety as $k\longrightarrow \infty$. As a corollary, we show under GRH that the zero divisors of Saito--Kurokawa lifts equidistribute as their weights tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Neural Operators for $2\times 2$ Hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network approximation of nonlinear operators, commonly referred to as DeepONet, has proven capable of approximating PDE backstepping designs in which a single Goursat-form PDE governs a single feedback gain function. In boundary control of coupled PDEs, coupled Goursat-form PDEs govern two or more gain kernels-a PDE structure unaddressed thus far with DeepONet. In this paper, we explore the subject of approximating systems of gain kernel PDEs for hyperbolic PDE plants by considering a simple counter-convecting $2\times 2$ coupled system in whose control a $2\times 2$ kernel PDE system in Goursat form arises. Engineering applications include oil drilling, the Saint-Venant model of shallow water waves, and the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model of stop-and-go instability in congested traffic flow. We establish the continuity of the mapping from a total of five plant PDE functional coefficients to the kernel PDE solutions, prove the existence of an arbitrarily close DeepONet approximation to the kernel PDEs, and ensure that the DeepONet-approximated gains guarantee stabilization when replacing the exact backstepping gain kernels. Taking into account anti-collocated boundary actuation and sensing, our $L^2$-Globally-exponentially stabilizing (GES) approximate gain kernel-based output feedback design implies the deep learning of both the controller's and the observer's gains. Moreover, the encoding of the output-feedback law into DeepONet ensures semi-global practical exponential stability (SG-PES). The DeepONet operator speeds up the computation of the controller gains by multiple orders of magnitude. Its theoretically proven stabilizing capability is demonstrated through simulations.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e and A. Denjoy. The long-standing problem of generalising these results for the equations of the order $k&gt;1$ (or for the systems of equations) is both important and difficult, requiring an essentially new approach. (See, e.g., an interesting old paper by P. Bohl.)
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying important conditions, which follow from the analogy with the solutions in the case $k=1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$</description>
