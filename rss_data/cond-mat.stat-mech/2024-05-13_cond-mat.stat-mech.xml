      <title>Power-law entanglement and Hilbert space fragmentation in non-reciprocal quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits utilizing measurement to evolve a quantum wave function offer a new and rich playground to engineer unconventional entanglement dynamics. Here we introduce a hybrid, non-reciprocal setup featuring a quantum circuit, whose updates are conditioned on the state of a classical dynamical agent. In our example the circuit is represented by a Majorana quantum chain controlled by a classical $N$-state Potts chain undergoing pair-flips. The local orientation of the classical spins controls whether randomly drawn local measurements on the quantum chain are allowed or not. This imposes a dynamical kinetic constraint on the entanglement growth, described by the transfer matrix of an $N$-colored loop model. It yields an equivalent description of the circuit by an $SU(N)$-symmetric Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian or by a kinetically constrained surface growth model for an $N$-component height field. For $N=2$, we find a diffusive growth of the half-chain entanglement towards a stationary profile $S(L)\sim L^{1/2}$ for $L$ sites. For $N\ge3$, the kinetic constraints impose Hilbert space fragmentation, yielding subdiffusive growth towards $S(L)\sim L^{0.57}$. This showcases how the control by a classical dynamical agent can enrich the entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits, paving a route toward novel entanglement dynamics in non-reciprocal hybrid circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. In a restricted setup we study the following limited precise problem. We note eqs. (A1) and (A2).
  \begin{equation} \label{A1} \tag{A1} b(n) \sim f(n)=\bigg((-1)^{n+1}\bigg)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) \left(\dfrac{n!}{\left(\left(\frac{n}{2d}\right)!\right)^{2d}}\right)ft(n) \end{equation}
  \begin{equation} \label{A2} \tag{A2} ft(n)=\hat{c} \prod\limits_{k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{n} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{n^{r}}\right) \end{equation}
  For $d \le 20$ and $n \le 20$ we define $\hat{b}(n)$ so that $\hat{b}(n)$ equals $b(n)$ if $n \leq N+1$, and equals $f(n)$ if $ n \geq N - r$. We pick $k=N- r$ and then $\hat{c}$, $c_{0}$. $c_{1}$,...,$c_{r}$ are uniquely determined. $N$ and $r$ must be chosen satisfying $N &lt; 20$ and $N - r &gt; 0$. In fact we work with $N = 10$ and $r \leq 6$ in this note and hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>Estimating Non-Stabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Iterative Clifford Circuit Renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to efficiently handle the dynamics of non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using an approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study a magic purification circuit, where a measurement-induced transition is observed.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium transport and the fluctuation theorem in the thermodynamic behaviors of nonlinear photonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear multimode optical systems have attracted substantial attention due to their rich physical properties. Complex interplay between the nonlinear effects and mode couplings makes it difficult to understand the collective dynamics of photons. Recent studies show that such collective phenomena can be effectively described by a Rayleigh-Jeans thermodynamics theory which is a powerful tool for the study of nonlinear multimode photonic systems. These systems, in turn, offer a compelling platform for investigating fundamental issues in statistical physics, attributed to their tunability and the ability to access negative temperature regimes. However, to date, a theory for the nonequilibrium transport and fluctuations is yet to be established. Here, we employ the full counting statistics theory to study the nonequilibrium transport of particle and energy in nonlinear multimode photonic systems in both positive and negative temperature regimes. Furthermore, we discover that in situations involving two reservoirs of opposite temperatures and chemical potentials, an intriguing phenomenon known as the loop current effect can arise, wherein the current in the positive energy sector runs counter to that in the negative energy sector. In addition, we numerically confirm that the fluctuation theorem remains applicable in optical thermodynamics systems across all regimes, from positive temperature to negative ones. Our findings closely align with numerical simulations based on first-principles nonlinear wave equations. Our work seeks to deepen the understanding of irreversible non-equilibrium processes and statistical fluctuations in nonlinear many-body photonic systems which will enhance our grasp of collective phenomena of photons and foster a fruitful intersection between optics and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Correlation Dimension of Natural Language in a Statistical Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation dimension of natural language is measured by applying the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to high-dimensional sequences produced by a large-scale language model. This method, previously studied only in a Euclidean space, is reformulated in a statistical manifold via the Fisher-Rao distance. Language exhibits a multifractal, with global self-similarity and a universal dimension around 6.5, which is smaller than those of simple discrete random sequences and larger than that of a Barab\'asi-Albert process. Long memory is the key to producing self-similarity. Our method is applicable to any probabilistic model of real-world discrete sequences, and we show an application to music data.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities in the order parameter space that are mathematically described by topological invariants and cannot be removed by continuous transformations. These defects play a significant role in various fields, ranging from cosmology to solid-state physics and biological matter. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, leading to decades of debate about the existence of topological defects in disordered systems, such as glasses. Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects might emerge in the dynamical properties of glasses under deformation, potentially relating to their plastic behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional colloidal glass system composed of particles interacting by an effective magnetic repulsion. We reveal the presence of topological defects in the eigenspace of the vibrational frequencies of this experimental 2D amorphous solid. The vibrational density of states of this 2D amorphous material exhibits distinct glassy properties such as the presence of a boson peak anomaly. Through extensive numerical and theoretical quantitative analysis, we establish a robust positive correlation between the vibrational characteristics and the total number of topological defects. We furthermore show that defects of opposite charge tend to pair together and prove their local statistical correlation with the "soft spots", the regions more prone to plastic flow. This work provides the experimental confirmation for the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing a complex interplay between topology, disorder, and vibrational behavior.</description>

      <title>Simple crowd dynamics to generate complex temporal contact networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</description>

      <title>Automatic Structural Search of Tensor Network States including Entanglement Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network (TN) states, including entanglement renormalization (ER), can encompass a wider variety of entangled states. When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent current response theory of jamming and vibrational modes in low-temperature amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study amorphous solids with strong elastic disorder and find an un-jamming instability that exists, inter alia, in an harmonic model built using Euclidean random matrices (ERM). Employing the Zwanzig-Mori projection operator formalism and Gaussian factorization approximations, we develop a first-principles, self-consistent theory of transverse momentum correlations in athermal disordered materials, extending beyond the standard Born approximation. The vibrational anomalies in glass at low temperatures are recovered in the stable solid limit, and floppy modes lacking restoring forces are predicted in unstable states below the jamming transition. Near the un-jamming transition, the speed of sound $v_0^\perp$ vanishes with $ \propto \sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the distance from the critical point. Additionally, the density of states develops a plateau, independent of $\epsilon$ above a frequency $\omega_*$ which vanishes at the transition, $\omega_*\propto |\epsilon|$. We identify a characteristic length scale in the un-jammed phase, $\lambda_-^\perp\propto1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, indicating the distance over which injected momentum remains correlated. We confirm the theoretical predictions with numerical solutions of a scalar ERM model, demonstrating overall good qualitative and partly quantitative agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we evaluate the averages of conserved densities and currents associated to charges of generic spin in (1+1)-dimensional massive integrable Quantum Field Theories perturbed by the irrelevant $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ operator. By making use of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz approach and of the theory of Generalised Hydrodynamics, we study the non-equilibrium steady state averages of conserved densities and currents in a partitioning protocol. We show that in particular limits, averages can be evaluated exactly in terms of quantities known from the unperturbed theory. In the massless limit we recover known results for the energy and momentum currents and generalise those to any higher spin conserved quantities. We extend some of our results to perturbations of the generalised $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ type. For the massive free fermion theory, we find an analytic expression for the effective inverse temperature after at $\mathrm{T\bar{T}}$ perturbation in terms of the bare inverse temperature by making use of Lambert's $W$ function.</description>

      <title>Faster entanglement production driven by quantum resonance in many-body rotors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonance in the paradigmatic kicked rotor model is a purely quantum effect that ignores the state of underlying classical chaos. In this work, the effect of quantum resonance on entanglement generation in the $N$-interacting kicked rotors is studied. We show a compelling feature: entanglement growth is superlinear in time until the timescale $t^*$, beyond which the entanglement production slows down to a logarithmic profile with superimposed oscillations. Notably, we find that at resonance, the entanglement dynamics is independent of the kick strength of rotors, but depends solely on the interaction strength. By mapping positional interaction to momentum space and analytically calculating the linear entropy, we elucidate the underlying mechanism driving these distinct growth profiles. The analytical findings are in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations performed for two- and three-interacting kicked rotors. Our results are amenable to an experimental realization on ultracold atom setup.</description>

Abstract: The long-time dynamics of quantum systems, typically, but not always, results in a thermal steady state. The microscopic processes that lead to or circumvent this fate are of interest, since everyday experience tells us that not all spatial regions of a system heat up or cool down uniformly. This motivates the question: under what conditions can one slow down or completely arrest thermalization locally? Is it possible to construct realistic Hamiltonians and initial states such that a local region is effectively insulated from the rest, or acts like a barrier between two or more regions? We answer this in the affirmative by outlining the conditions that govern the flow of energy and entropy between subsystems. Using these ideas we provide a representative example for how simple few-body states can be used to engineer a ``thermal switch" between interacting regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a discrete-space model of active matter with excluded volume. Particles are restricted to the sites of a triangular lattice, and can assume one of three orientations. Varying the density and noise intensity, Monte Carlo simulations reveal a variety of spatial patterns. Ordered states occur in the form of condensed structures, which (away from the full occupancy limit) coexist with a low-density vapor. The condensed structures feature low particle mobility, particularly those that wrap the system via the periodic boundaries. As the noise intensity is increased, dense structures give way to a disordered phase. We characterize the parameter values associated with the condensed phases and perform a detailed study of the order-disorder transition at (1) full occupation and (2) at a density of 0.1. In the former case, the model possesses the same symmetry as the three-state Potts model and exhibits a continuous phase transition, as expected, with critical exponents consistent with those of the associated Potts model. In the low-density case, the transition is clearly discontinuous, with strong dependence of the final state upon the initial configuration, hysteresis,and nonmonotonic dependence of the Binder cumulant upon noise intensity.</description>

Examples include the distribution for the first-exit time from an interval, moments for the first-exit site, and functionals of the position, which involve memory and time integration. As a key example, we compute analytically the mean area swept by a biased diffusion until it escapes an interval that may be asymmetric and have arbitrary length. The mean area allows us to derive the hitherto unexplored cross-correlation function between the first-exit time and the first-exit site, which vanishes only for exit problems from symmetric intervals. As a colophon, we explore connections of our results with gambling, showing that betting on the time-integrated value of a losing game it is possible to design a strategy that leads to a net average win.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: ETH and Equilibration in a Free Fermion Chain</title>

Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the derivation of irreversibility in classical systems mostly relies on certain randomness. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the justification of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) in the large-deviation form.</description>

Abstract: Annealing algorithms such as simulated annealing and population annealing are widely used both for sampling the Gibbs distribution and solving optimization problems (i.e. finding ground states). For both statistical mechanics and optimization, additional parameters beyond temperature are often needed such as chemical potentials, external fields or Lagrange multipliers enforcing constraints. In this paper we derive a formalism for optimal annealing schedules in multidimensional parameter spaces using methods from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The results are closely related to work on optimal control of thermodynamic systems [Sivak and Crooks, PRL 108, 190602 (2012)]. Within the formalism, we compare the efficiency of population annealing and multiple weighted runs of simulated annealing ("annealed importance sampling") and discuss the effects of non-ergodicity on both algorithms. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Role of long jumps in L\'evy noise induced multimodality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\'evy noise is a paradigmatic noise used to describe out-of-equilibrium systems. Typically, properties of L\'evy noise driven systems are very different from their Gaussian white noise driven counterparts. In particular, under action of L\'evy noise, stationary states in single-well, super-harmonic, potentials are no longer unimodal. Typically, they are bimodal however for fine-tuned potentials the number of modes can be further increased. The multimodality arises as a consequence of the competition between long displacements induced by the non-equilibrium stochastic driving and action of the deterministic force. Here, we explore robustness of bimodality in the quartic potential under action of the L\'evy noise. We explore various scenarios of bounding long jumps and assess their ability to weaken and destroy multimodality. In general, we demonstrate that despite its robustness it is possible to destroy the bimodality, however it requires drastic reduction in the length of noise-induced jumps.</description>

Abstract: Several branches of computing use a system's physical dynamics to do computation. We show that the dynamics of an underdamped harmonic oscillator can perform multifunctional computation, solving distinct problems at distinct times within a dynamical trajectory. Oscillator computing usually focuses on the oscillator's phase as the information-carrying component. Here we focus on the time-resolved amplitude of an oscillator whose inputs influence its frequency, which has a natural parallel as the activity of a time-dependent neural unit. We call this unit an oscillatron. The activity of an oscillatron at fixed time is a nonmonotonic function of the input, and so it can solve nonlinearly-separable problems such as XOR. The activity of the oscillatron at fixed input is a nonmonotonic function of time, and so it is multifunctional in a temporal sense, able to carry out distinct nonlinear computations at distinct times within the same dynamical trajectory. Time-resolved computing of this nature can be done in or out of equilibrium, with the natural time evolution of the system giving us multiple computations for the price of one.</description>

      <title>Modified version of open TASEP with dynamic defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the study of site-wise dynamically disordered totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Motivated by the process of gene transcription, a study in ref. \cite{waclaw2019totally} introduced an extension of TASEP, where the defects (or obstacles) bind/un-bind dynamically to the sites of the lattice and the hopping of the particles on lattice faces a hindrance if the arrival site is occupied by an obstacle. In addition, the particle is only allowed to enter the lattice provided the first site is defect-free. In our study, we propose that the particle movement at the entry of the lattice must face an equal hindrance that is provided by the obstacles to the rest of the particles on the lattice. For open boundaries, the continuum mean-field equations are derived and solved numerically to obtain steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles. The presence of obstacles produces a shift in the phase boundaries obtained but the same three phases as obtained for the standard TASEP. Contrary to the model introduced in ref. \cite{waclaw2019totally}, the idea to introduce the modification at the entrance shows that the limiting case $p_d \rightarrow 1$ converges to the standard TASEP, where $p_d$ refers to the affected hopping rate due to presence of obstacle. The mean-field solutions are validated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

Abstract: A finite cycle time information engine based on a two-level system in contact with a thermal reservoir is studied analytically. The model for the engine incorporates an error in measuring the system's state and time delay between the measurement and the feedback process. The efficiency and power of the engine in steady state are derived as a function of level spacing, feedback delay time, engine cycle time, and measurement error. For a fixed value of level spacing and feedback delay, there is an upper bound on measurement error such that the engine can extract positive work. This threshold value of error is found to be independent of the cycle time. For a range of values of level spacing and feedback delay time, efficiency has a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement error, implying that there is an optimal measurement error for the information engine to operate efficiently. At high temperatures and with precise measurement, the engine's ability to extract positive work is extended over a larger range of feedback delay time.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Facilitation Governs the Equilibration Dynamics of Glasses</title>

Abstract: Convincing evidence of domain growth in the heating of ultrastable glasses suggests that the equilibration dynamics of super-cooled liquids could be driven by a nucleation and growth mechanism. We investigate this possibility by simulating the equilibration dynamics of a model glass during both heating and cooling between poorly and well-annealed states. Though we do observe the growth of domains during heating, we find that domains are absent during cooling. This absence is inconsistent with classical nucleation theory. By comparing the equilibration dynamics of our glass with that of two models with kinetic constraints, we demonstrate that dynamical facilitation generically leads to heating driven by domain growth and cooling without domains. Our results provide strong evidence that dynamical facilitation, not nucleation and interfacial-tension-driven domain growth, is the driving mechanism for the equilibration dynamics of glass-formers.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase of Higher Dimensional Integrable Models</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of generating Floquet-time crystals in higher dimensions ($d\geq 2$) through the time-periodic driving of integrable free-fermionic models. The realization leads to rigid time-crystal phases that are ideally resistant to thermalization and decoherence. By utilizing spin-orbit coupling, we are able to realize a robust time-crystal phase that can be detected using novel techniques. Moreover, we discuss the significance of studying the highly persistent subharmonic responses and their implementation in a Kitaev spin liquid, which contributes to our understanding of time translational symmetry breaking and its practical implications.</description>

Abstract: But if you treat it as a two-form, you get three nontrivial renormalization group fixed points! Which becomes the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions? Motivated by this question, we study the conformal bootstrap constraint in the $O(d)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d$ dimensions, varying $d$ as a continuous parameter. Besides the one that is naturally connected to the Heisenberg fixed point in three dimensions, we find "evanescent" kinks whose origin is yet to be identified. We also bootstrap $O(4), O(5), O(6)$ anti-symmetric matrix model in $d=3$, aiming at physical applications.</description>
