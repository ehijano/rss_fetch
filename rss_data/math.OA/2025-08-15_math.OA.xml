      <title>Deciding Whether a C-Q Channel Preserves a Bit is QCMA-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that deciding whether a classical-quantum (C-Q) channel can exactly preserve a single classical bit is QCMA-complete. This "bit-preservation" problem is a special case of orthogonality-constrained optimization tasks over C-Q channels, in which one seeks orthogonal input states whose outputs have small or large Hilbert-Schmidt overlap after passing through the channel. Both problems can be cast as biquadratic optimization with orthogonality constraints. Our main technical contribution uses tools from matrix analysis to give a complete characterization of the optimal witnesses: computational basis states for the minimum, and |+&gt;, |-&gt; over a single basis pair for the maximum. Using this characterization, we give concise proofs of QCMA-completeness for both problems.</description>

      <title>The matched projections of idempotents on Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give new characterizations of some fundamental issues about idempotents. In the general setting of adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules, a new term of quasi-projection pair is introduced. For each idempotent $Q$, a projection $m(Q)$, called the matched projection of $Q$, is constructed. It is shown that $Q$ and $m(Q)$ as idempotents are homotopic, and $\big(m(Q),Q\big)$ is a quasi-projection pair. Some formulas for $m(Q)$ are derived. Based on these formulas, representations and norm estimations associated with $m(Q)$ are dealt with.</description>

      <title>Compact Quantum Homogeneous K\"ahler Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.14007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative K\"ahler structures were recently introduced as an algebraic framework for studying noncommutative complex geometry on quantum homogeneous spaces. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a \emph{compact quantum homogeneous K\"ahler space} which gives a natural set of compatibility conditions between covariant K\"ahler structures and Woronowicz's theory of compact quantum groups. Each such object admits a Hilbert space completion possessing a remarkably rich yet tractable structure. The analytic behaviour of the associated Dolbeault-Dirac operators is moulded by the complex geometry of the underlying calculus. In particular, twisting the Dolbeault-Dirac operator by a negative Hermitian holomorphic module is shown to give a Fredholm operator if and only if the top anti-holomorphic cohomology group is finite-dimensional. In this case, the operator's index coincides with the twisted holomorphic Euler characteristic of the underlying noncommutative complex structure. The irreducible quantum flag manifolds, endowed with their Heckenberger-Kolb calculi, are presented as motivating examples.</description>

      <title>A note on noncommutative CW-spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the machinery of arXiv:2009.07539 to give an alternative proof of one of the main results of arXiv:2101.09775. This result states that the category of noncommutative CW-spectra can be modelled as the category of spectral presheaves on a certain category M, whose objects can be thought of as "suspension spectra of matrix algebras". The advantage of our proof is that it mainly relies on well-known results on (stable) model categories.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [43], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [49].</description>
