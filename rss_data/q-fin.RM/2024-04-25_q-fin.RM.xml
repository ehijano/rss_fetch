      <title>Algorithmic Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework utilizing a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to model the EFP spread. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>

      <title>Measuring Name Concentrations through Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning approach for the quantification of name concentration risk in loan portfolios. Our approach is tailored for small portfolios and allows for both an actuarial as well as a mark-to-market definition of loss. The training of our neural network relies on Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling which we explicitly formulate for the CreditRisk${+}$ and the ratings-based CreditMetrics model. Numerical results based on simulated as well as real data demonstrate the accuracy of our new approach and its superior performance compared to existing analytical methods for assessing name concentration risk in small and concentrated portfolios.</description>
