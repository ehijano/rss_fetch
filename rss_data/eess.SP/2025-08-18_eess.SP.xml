      <title>Vibe2Spike: Batteryless Wireless Tags for Vibration Sensing with Event Cameras and Spiking Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\% average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable, and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a batteryless manner.</description>

      <title>Data-driven RF Tomography via Cross-modal Sensing and Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant potential for underground target detection, due to the penetrative nature of RF signals through soil. However, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and robust performance in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a data-driven radio frequency tomography (DRIFT) framework with the following key components to reconstruct cross section images of underground root tubers, even with significant changes in RF signals. First, we design a cross-modal sensing system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29 cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach. Our DRIFT code and dataset are publicly available on https://github.com/Data-driven-RTI/DRIFT.</description>

      <title>Inductive transfer learning from regression to classification in ECG analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the statistical properties of real data without compromising patient confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval, QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.</description>

      <title>Robust Sparse Bayesian Learning Based on Minimum Error Entropy for Noisy High-Dimensional Brain Activity Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Sparse Bayesian learning provides an effective scheme to solve the high-dimensional problem in brain signal decoding. However, traditional assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity. Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that, our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications such as brain-computer interface.</description>

      <title>CECGSR: Circular ECG Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various cardiac diseases. ECG signals suffer from low-resolution (LR) due to the use of convenient acquisition devices, as well as internal and external noises and artifacts. Classical ECG super-resolution (ECGSR) methods adopt an open-loop architecture that converts LR ECG signals to super-resolution (SR) ones. According to the theory of automatic control, a closed-loop framework exhibits superior dynamic and static performance compared with its open-loop counterpart. This paper proposes a closed-loop approach, termed circular ECGSR (CECGSR), which models the degradation process from SR ECG signals to LR ones. The negative feedback mechanism of the closed-loop system is based on the differences between the LR ECG signals. A mathematical loop equation is constructed to characterize the closed-loop infrastructure. The Taylor series expansion is employed to demonstrate the near-zero steady-state error of the proposed method. A Plug-and-Play strategy is considered to establish the SR unit of the proposed architecture, leveraging any existing advanced open-loop ECGSR methods. Simulation experiments on both noiseless and noisy subsets of the PTB-XL datasets demonstrate that the proposed CECGSR outperforms state-of-the-art open-loop ECGSR algorithms in the reconstruction performance of ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Pairwise Learning Optimization Framework for Cross-Corpus EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Based on Prototype Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges, especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems, we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/Mcd_PL.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Real-Time 4-Stage Sleep Classification at 10-Second Resolution: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light, and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1) a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Neural Network for Multimodal ECG Signals: Intermediate vs Late Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d &gt; 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Neural Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) remains the most critical bottleneck in modern wireless networks, with pilot overhead consuming up to 11-21% of transmission bandwidth, increasing latency by 20-40% in massive MIMO systems, and reducing potential spectral efficiency by over 53%. Traditional estimation techniques fundamentally fail under mobility, with feedback delays as small as 4 ms causing 50% throughput degradation at even modest speeds (30 km/h). We present neural Gaussian radio fields (nGRF), a novel framework that leverages explicit 3D Gaussian primitives to synthesize complex channel matrices accurately and efficiently. Unlike NeRF-based approaches that rely on slow implicit representations or existing Gaussian splatting methods that use non-physical 2D projections, nGRF performs direct 3D electromagnetic field aggregation, with each Gaussian acting as a localized radio modulator. nGRF demonstrates superior performance across diverse environments: in indoor scenarios, it achieves a 10.9$\times$ higher prediction SNR than state of the art methods while reducing inference latency from 242 ms to just 1.1 ms (a 220$\times$ speedup). For large-scale outdoor environments, where existing approaches fail to function, nGRF achieves an SNR of 26.2 dB. Moreover, nGRF requires only 0.011 measurements per cubic foot compared to 0.2-178.1 for existing methods, thereby reducing data collection burden by 18$\times$. Training time is similarly reduced from hours to minutes (a 180$\times$ reduction), enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic environments.

      <title>Direction of Arrival Estimation: A Tutorial Survey of Classical and Modern Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in array signal processing with applications spanning radar, sonar, wireless communications, and acoustic signal processing. This tutorial survey provides a comprehensive introduction to classical and modern DOA estimation methods, specifically designed for students and researchers new to the field. We focus on narrowband signal processing using uniform linear arrays, presenting step-by-step mathematical derivations with geometric intuition. The survey covers classical beamforming methods, subspace-based techniques (MUSIC, ESPRIT), maximum likelihood approaches, and sparse signal processing methods. Each method is accompanied by Python implementations available in an open-source repository, enabling reproducible research and hands-on learning. Through systematic performance comparisons across various scenarios, we provide practical guidelines for method selection and parameter tuning. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation, making DOA estimation accessible to beginners while serving as a comprehensive reference for the field. See https://github.com/AmgadSalama/DOA for detail implementation of the methods.</description>

      <title>Age-Normalized HRV Features for Non-Invasive Glucose Prediction: A Pilot Sleep-Aware Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction, representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p = 0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network based on a Functional Topology Model: Unveiling the Dynamic Mechanisms of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Single-Channel EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel "Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods: EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (&gt;85%) and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%). Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Corrosion Resistance of Aluminum Alloys Through AI and ML Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.</description>

      <title>The Lost-K and Shorter-J Phenomenon in Non-Standard Ballistocardiography Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-standard ballistocardiogram(BCG) data generally do not have prominent J peaks. This paper introduces two phenomena that reduce the prominence of Jpeaks: the shorter-J phenomenon and the lost-K phenomenon, both of which are commonly observed in non-standard BCG signals . This paper also proposes three signal transformation methods that effectively improve the lost-K and shorter-J phenomena. The methods were evaluated on a time-aligned ECG-BCG dataset with 40 subjects. The results show that based on the transformed signal, simple J-peak-based methods using only the detection of local maxima or minima show better performance in locating J-peaks and extracting BCG cycles, especially for non-standard BCG data.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Anti-Jamming Techniques for UAV Communications in Adversarial Environments: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle communications are encountering increasingly severe multi-source interference challenges in dynamic adversarial environments, which impose higher demands on their reliability and resilience. To address these challenges, agent-based autonomous anti-jamming techniques have emerged as a crucial research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that first formalizes the concept of intelligent anti-jamming agents for UAV communications and establishes a closed-loop decision-making framework centered on the "Perception-Decision-Action" (P-D-A) paradigm. Within this framework, we systematically review key technologies at each stage, with particular emphasis on employing game theory to model UAV-jammer interactions and integrating reinforcement learning-based intelligent algorithms to derive adaptive anti-jamming strategies. Furthermore, we discuss potential limitations of current approaches, identify critical engineering challenges, and outline promising future research directions, aiming to provide valuable references for developing more intelligent and robust anti-jamming communication systems for UAVs.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Learning Models for EEG-Based Identification of Pain Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from 108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance, while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same generalization constraints.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Technology-Agnostic Diagnosis and Predictive Maintenance for Point Machine using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal. This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing, but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving &gt;99.99\% precision, &lt;0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359 standard.</description>

      <title>Track Component Failure Detection Using Data Analytics over existing STDS Track Circuit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS), designed with both high and low-frequency bands. This approach uses STDS current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.</description>

      <title>Operational machine learning for park-scale irrigation to support urban cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban parks can mitigate local heat, yet irrigation control is usually tuned for water savings rather than cooling. We report on SIMPaCT (Smart Irrigation Management for Parks and Cool Towns), a park-scale deployment that links per-zone soil-moisture forecasts to overnight irrigation set-points in support of urban cooling. SIMPaCT ingests data from 202 soil-moisture sensors, 50 temperature-relative humidity (TRH) nodes, and 13 weather stations, and trains a per-sensor k-nearest neighbours (kNN) predictor on short rolling windows (200-900h). A rule-first anomaly pipeline screens missing and stuck-at signals, with model-based checks (Isolation Forest and ARIMA). When a device fails, a mutual-information neighbourhood selects the most informative neighbour and a small multilayer perceptron supplies a "virtual sensor" until restoration. Across sensors the mean absolute error was 0.78%, comparable to more complex baselines; the upper-quartile error (P75) was lower for kNN than SARIMA (0.71% vs 0.93%). SIMPaCT runs daily and writes proposed set-points to the existing controller for operator review. This short communication reports an operational recipe for robust, cooling-oriented irrigation at city-park scale.</description>

      <title>Scaling Wideband Massive MIMO Radar via Beamspace Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an architecture for scaling digital beamforming for wideband massive MIMO radar. Conventional spatial processing becomes computationally prohibitive as array size grows; for example, the computational complexity of MVDR beamforming scales as O(N^3) for an N-element array. In this paper, we show that energy concentration in beamspace provides the basis for drastic complexity reduction, with array scaling governed by the O(NlogN) complexity of the spatial FFT used for beamspace transformation. Specifically, we propose an architecture for windowed beamspace MVDR beamforming, parallelized across targets and subbands, and evaluate its efficacy for beamforming and interference suppression for government-supplied wideband radar data from the DARPA SOAP (Scalable On-Array Processing) program. We demonstrate that our approach achieves detection performance comparable to full-dimensional benchmarks while significantly reducing computational and training overhead, and provide insight into tradeoffs between beamspace window size and FFT resolution in balancing complexity, detection accuracy, and interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Digital Post-Distortion Architectures for Nonlinear Power Amplifiers: Volterra and Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern 5G user equipments (UEs), the power amplifier (PA) contributes significantly to power consumption during uplink transmissions, especially in cell-edge scenarios. While reducing power backoff can enhance PA efficiency, it introduces nonlinear distortions that degrade signal quality. Existing solutions, such as digital pre-distortion, require complex feedback mechanisms for optimal performance, leading to increased UE complexity and power consumption. Instead, in this study we explore digital post-distortion (DPoD) techniques, which compensate for these distortions at the base station, leveraging its superior computational resources. In this study, we conduct an comprehensive study concerning the challenges and advantages associated with applying DPoD in time-domain, frequency-domain, and DFT-s-domain. Our findings suggest that implementing DPoD in the time-domain, complemented by frequency-domain channel equalization, strikes a good balance between low computational complexity and efficient nonlinearity compensation. In addition, we demonstrate that memory has to be taken into account regardless of the memory of the PA. Subsequently, we show how to pose the complex-valued problem of nonlinearity compensation in a real Hilbert space, emphasizing the potential performance enhancements as a result. We then discuss the traditional Volterra series and show an equivalent kernel method that can reduce algorithmic complexity. Simulations validate the results of our analysis and show that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Driving with RSMA-Enabled Finite Blocklength Transmissions: Ergodic Performance Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is a key technology for next-generation multiple access systems due to its robustness against imperfect channel state information (CSI). This makes RSMA particularly suitable for high-mobility autonomous driving, where ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is essential. To address the stringent requirements, this study enables RSMA finite blocklength (FBL) transmissions and explicitly evaluates the ergodic performance. We derive the closed-form lower bound for the ergodic sum-rate of RSMA, considering vital factors such as the vehicle velocities, vehicle positions, power allocation of each stream, blocklengths, and block error rates (BLERs). To further enhance the ergodic sum-rate while complying with quality of service (QoS) rate constraints, we jointly optimize the global power coefficient, private power distribution, and common rate splitting. Guided by gradient descent, we first adjust the global power coefficient based on its sum-rate solution. This parameter regulates the power state of the common stream, allowing for dynamic activation or deactivation: if active, we optimize the private power distribution and adjust the common rate splitting to meet minimum transmission constraints; if inactive, we use the sequential quadratic programming for private power distribution optimization. Simulation results confirm that our RSMA scheme significantly improves the ergodic performance, reduces blocklength and BLER, surpassing the RSMA counterpart with average private power and space division multiple access (SDMA). Furthermore, our approach is validated to guarantee the rates for users with the poorest channel conditions, thereby enhancing fairness across the network.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Multidimensional Chinese Remainder Theorem (MD-CRT) for Multiple Integer Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is widely applied in cryptography, coding theory, and signal processing. It has been extended to the multidimensional CRT (MD-CRT), which reconstructs an integer vector from its vector remainders modulo multiple integer matrices. This paper investigates a generalized MD-CRT for multiple integer vectors, where the goal is to determine multiple integer vectors from multiple vector residue sets modulo multiple integer matrices.Comparing to the existing generalized CRT for multiple scalar integers, the challenge is that the moduli in MD-CRT are matrices that do not commute and the corresponding uniquely determinable range is multidimensional and the inclusion relationship is much more complicated. In this paper,we address two fundamental questions regarding the generalized MD-CRT. The first question concerns the uniquely determinable range of multiple integer vectors when no prior information about them is available. The second question is about the conditions under which the maximal possible dynamic range can be achieved.To answer these two questions, we first derive a uniquely determinable range without prior information and accordingly propose an algorithm to achieve it. A special case involving only two integer vectors is investigated for the second question, leading to a new condition for achieving the maximal possible dynamic range. Interestingly, this newly obtained condition, when the dimension is reduced to $1$, is even better than the existing ones for the conventional generalized CRT for scalar integers.These results may have applications for frequency detection in multidimensional signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless communication systems has created complex electromagnetic environments where multiple cellular standards (2G/3G/4G/5G) coexist, necessitating advanced signal source separation techniques. We present RFSS (RF Signal Source Separation), a comprehensive open-source dataset containing 52,847 realistic multi-standard RF signal samples with complete 3GPP standards compliance. Our framework generates authentic baseband signals for GSM, UMTS, LTE, and 5G NR with advanced channel modeling including multipath fading, MIMO processing up to 8 by 8 antennas, and realistic interference scenarios. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance of CNN-LSTM architectures achieving 26.7 dB SINR improvement in source separation tasks, significantly outperforming traditional ICA (15.2 dB) and NMF (18.3 dB) approaches. The RFSS dataset enables reproducible research in RF source separation, cognitive radio, and machine learning applications while maintaining complete open-source accessibility</description>

      <title>Effect of Phase Shift Errors on the Security of UAV-assisted STAR-RIS IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-mounted simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) systems can provide full-dimensional coverage and flexible deployment opportunities in future 6G-enabled IoT networks. However, practical imperfections such as jittering and airflow of UAV could affect the phase shift of STAR-RIS, and consequently degrade network security. In this respect, this paper investigates the impact of phase shift errors on the secrecy performance of UAV-mounted STAR-RIS-assisted IoT systems. More specifically, we consider a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where IoT devices are grouped into two groups: one group on each side of the STAR-RIS. The nodes in each group are considered as potential Malicious nodes for the ones on the other side. By modeling phase estimation errors using a von Mises distribution, analytical closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates under imperfect phase adjustment are derived. An optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) by optimizing the UAV placement is formulated and is then solved using a linear grid-based algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations. The impact of phase estimation errors on system's secrecy performance is analyzed, providing critical insights for the practical realisation of STAR-RIS deployments for secure UAV-enabled IoT networks.</description>

      <title>ATLAS: AI-Native Receiver Test-and-Measurement by Leveraging AI-Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers, or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks, has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead, it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19% compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem, demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Weighted Covariance Intersection for Range-based Distributed Cooperative Localization of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise localization of multi-agent systems (MAS) in harsh environments is a critical challenge for swarm applications, and cooperative localization is considered a key solution to this issue. Among all solutions, distributed cooperative localization (DCL) has garnered widespread attention due to its robustness and scalability. The main challenge of DCL lies in how to fuse relative measurements between agents under unknown correlations. To address this, covariance intersection (CI) was introduced to DCL. However, the classical CI optimization criteria suffer from issues such as scale imbalance and correlation mismatch during the fusion process. These deficiencies are not as pronounced in 2D scenarios, where the state space is relatively simple and the observability of each state component is well. However, in 3D scenarios, where the state space is more complex and there are significant disparities in the scale and observability of state components, performance degradation becomes severe. This necessitates the design of specialized mechanisms to improve the data fusion process. In this paper, we identify three main drawbacks of the classical CI optimization criteria in recursive filtering and introduce a weighting mechanism, namely weighted covariance intersection (WCI), to improve its performance. We then introduce WCI into range-based distributed cooperative localization in 3D scenarios, developing a concurrent fusion strategy for multiple distance measurements and designing a weighting matrix based on the error propagation rule of the inertial navigation system (INS). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WCI significantly enhances cooperative localization performance compared to classical CI, while the distributed approach outperforms the centralized approach in terms of robustness, scalability, and is more suitable for large-scale swarms.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Human Activity Recognition: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users, sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25 publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches, including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition, we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation) and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference. The complete list of this survey is available at https://github.com/rh20624/Awesome-IMU-Sensing, which will be updated continuously.</description>

      <title>A Novel Symbol Level Precoding based AFDM Transmission Framework: Offloading Equalization Burden to Transmitter Side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has attracted considerable attention for its robustness to Doppler effects. However, its high receiver-side computational complexity remains a major barrier to practical deployment. To address this, we propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based AFDM transmission framework, which shifts the signal processing burden in downlink communications from user side to the base station (BS), enabling direct symbol detection without requiring channel estimation or equalization at the receiver. Specifically, in the uplink phase, we propose a Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) based channel estimation algorithm by exploiting the inherent sparsity of affine frequency (AF) domain channels. In particular, the sparse prior is modeled via a hierarchical Laplace distribution, and parameters are iteratively updated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We also derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) to characterize the theoretical performance limit. In the downlink phase, the BS employs the SLP technology to design the transmitted waveform based on the estimated uplink channel state information (CSI) and channel reciprocity. The resulting optimization problem is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem, and its dual problem is investigated by Lagrangian function and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SBL estimator outperforms traditional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in accuracy and robustness to off-grid effects, while the SLP-based waveform design scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional AFDM receivers while significantly reducing the computational complexity at receiver, validating the practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Polarization Reconfigurable Transmit-Receive Beam Alignment with Interpretable Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancement in next generation reconfigurable antenna and fluid antenna technology has influenced the wireless system with polarization reconfigurable (PR) channels to attract significant attention for promoting beneficial channel condition. We exploit the benefit of PR antennas by integrating such technology into massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. In particular, we aim to jointly design the polarization and beamforming vectors on both transceivers for simultaneous channel reconfiguration and beam alignment, which remarkably enhance the beamforming gain. However, joint optimization over polarization and beamforming vectors without channel state information (CSI) is a challenging task, since depolarization increases the channel dimension; whereas massive MIMO systems typically have low-dimensional pilot measurement from limited radio frequency (RF) chain. This leads to pilot overhead because the transceivers can only observe low-dimensional measurement of the high-dimension channel. This paper pursues the reduction of the pilot overhead in such systems by proposing to employ \emph{interpretable transformer}-based deep learning framework on both transceivers to actively design the polarization and beamforming vectors for pilot stage and transmission stage based on the sequence of accumulated received pilots. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant performance gain of our proposed framework over the existing non-adaptive and active data-driven methods. Furthermore, we exploit the interpretability of our proposed framework to analyze the learning capabilities of the model.</description>

      <title>Jamming Identification with Differential Transformer for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless jamming identification, which detects and classifies electromagnetic jamming from non-cooperative devices, is crucial for emerging low-altitude wireless networks consisting of many drone terminals that are highly susceptible to electromagnetic jamming. However, jamming identification schemes adopting deep learning (DL) are vulnerable to attacks involving carefully crafted adversarial samples, resulting in inevitable robustness degradation. To address this issue, we propose a differential transformer framework for wireless jamming identification. Firstly, we introduce a differential transformer network in order to distinguish jamming signals, which overcomes the attention noise when compared with its traditional counterpart by performing self-attention operations in a differential manner. Secondly, we propose a randomized masking training strategy to improve network robustness, which leverages the patch partitioning mechanism inherent to transformer architectures in order to create parallel feature extraction branches. Each branch operates on a distinct, randomly masked subset of patches, which fundamentally constrains the propagation of adversarial perturbations across the network. Additionally, the ensemble effect generated by fusing predictions from these diverse branches demonstrates superior resilience against adversarial attacks. Finally, we introduce a novel consistent training framework that significantly enhances adversarial robustness through dualbranch regularization. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methodology is superior to existing methods in boosting robustness to adversarial samples.</description>

      <title>Coherent Compensation-Based Sensing for Long-Range Targets in Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising candidate technology for 6G due to its improvement in spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.</description>

      <title>On the Extension of Differential Beamforming Theory to Arbitrary Planar Arrays of First-Order Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-size acoustic arrays exploit spatial diversity to achieve capabilities beyond those of single-element devices, with applications ranging from teleconferencing to immersive multimedia. A key requirement for broadband array processing is a frequency-invariant spatial response, which ensures consistent directivity across wide bandwidths and prevents spectral coloration. Differential beamforming offers an inherently frequency-invariant solution by leveraging pressure differences between closely spaced elements of small-size arrays. Traditional approaches, however, assume the array elements to be omnidirectional, whereas real transducers exhibit frequency-dependent directivity that can degrade performance if not properly modeled. To address this limitation, we propose a generalized modal matching framework for frequency-invariant differential beamforming, applicable to unconstrained planar arrays of first-order directional elements. By representing the desired beampattern as a truncated circular harmonic expansion and fitting it to the actual element responses, our method accommodates arbitrary planar geometries and element orientations. This approach enables the synthesis of beampatterns of any order and steering direction without imposing rigid layout requirements. Simulations confirm that accounting for sensor directivity at the design stage yields accurate and robust performance across varying frequencies, geometries, and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards SISO Bistatic Sensing for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver, making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0 consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.</description>

      <title>Factorized Disentangled Representation Learning for Interpretable Radio Frequency Fingerprin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and rising security risks, Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) has become key for device identification and authentication. However, various changing factors - beyond the RFF itself - can be entangled from signal transmission to reception, reducing the effectiveness of RFF Identification (RFFI). Existing RFFI methods mainly rely on domain adaptation techniques, which often lack explicit factor representations, resulting in less robustness and limited controllability for downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) framework that learns explicit and independent representations of multiple factors, including the RFF. Our framework introduces modules for disentanglement, guided by the principles of explicitness, modularity, and compactness. We design two dedicated modules for factor classification and signal reconstruction, each with tailored loss functions that encourage effective disentanglement and enhance support for downstream tasks. Thus, the framework can extract a set of interpretable vectors that explicitly represent corresponding factors. We evaluate our approach on two public benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset. Our method achieves impressive performance on multiple DRL metrics. We also analyze the effectiveness of our method on downstream RFFI task and conditional signal generation task. All modules of the framework contribute to improved classification accuracy, and enable precise control over conditional generated signals. These results highlight the potential of our DRL framework for interpretable and explicit RFFs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning for UAV Radio-Frequency Open-Set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G-Advanced (5G-A) has enabled the vibrant development of low altitude integrated sensing and communication (LA-ISAC) networks. As a core component of these networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have witnessed rapid growth in recent years. However, due to the lag in traditional industry regulatory norms, unauthorized flight incidents occur frequently, posing a severe security threat to LA-ISAC networks. To surveil the non-cooperative UAVs, in this paper, we propose a multi-domain supervised contrastive learning (MD-SupContrast) framework for UAV radio frequency (RF) open-set recognition. Specifically, first, the texture features and the time-frequency position features from the ResNet and the TransformerEncoder are fused, and then the supervised contrastive learning is applied to optimize the feature representation of the closed-set samples. Next, to surveil the invasive UAVs that appear in real life, we propose an improved generative OpenMax (IG-OpenMax) algorithm and construct an open-set recognition model, namely Open-RFNet. According to the unknown samples, we first freeze the feature extraction layers and then only retrain the classification layer, which achieves excellent recognition performance both in closed-set and open-set recognitions. We analyze the computational complexity of the proposed model. Experiments are conducted with a large-scale UAV open dataset. The results show that the proposed Open-RFNet outperforms the existing benchmark methods in terms of recognition accuracy between the known and the unknown UAVs, as it achieves 95.12% in closed-set and 96.08% in open-set under 25 UAV types, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of 6G networks demands ultra-massive connectivity and intelligent radio environments, yet existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technologies face critical limitations in hardware efficiency, dynamic control, and scalability. This paper introduces LLM-RIMSA, a transformative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a novel reconfigurable intelligent metasurface antenna (RIMSA) architecture to address these challenges. Unlike conventional RIS designs, RIMSA employs parallel coaxial feeding and 2D metasurface integration, enabling each individual metamaterial element to independently adjust both its amplitude and phase. While traditional optimization and deep learning (DL) methods struggle with high-dimensional state spaces and prohibitive training costs for RIMSA control, LLM-RIMSA leverages pre-trained LLMs cross-modal reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities to dynamically optimize RIMSA configurations. Simulations demonstrate that LLM-RIMSA achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional DL-based methods in sum rate while reducing training overhead. The proposed framework pave the way for LLM-driven intelligent radio environments.</description>

      <title>Range-Angle Likelihood Maps for Indoor Positioning Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and high precision of the indoor positioning is as important as ensuring reliable navigation in outdoor environments. Using the state-of-the-art deep learning models provides better reliability and accuracy to navigate and monitor the accurate positions in the aircraft cabin environment. We utilize the simulated aircraft cabin environment measurements and propose a residual neural network (ResNet) model to predict the accurate positions inside the cabin. The measurements include the ranges and angles between a tag and the anchors points which are then mapped onto a grid as range and angle residuals. These residual maps are then transformed into the likelihood grid maps where each cell of the grid shows the likelihood of being a true location. These grid maps along with the true positions are then passed as inputs to train the ResNet model. Since any deep learning model involve numerous parameter settings, hyperparameter optimization is performed to get the optimal parameters for training the model effectively with the highest accuracy. Once we get the best hyperparameters settings of the model, it is then trained to predict the positions which provides a centimeter-level accuracy of the localization.</description>

      <title>A Compute&amp;Memory Efficient Model-Driven Neural 5G Receiver for Edge AI-assisted RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence approaches for base-band processing for radio receivers have demonstrated significant performance gains. Most of the proposed methods are characterized by high compute and memory requirements, hindering their deployment at the edge of the Radio Access Networks (RAN) and limiting their scalability to large bandwidths and many antenna 6G systems. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity, model-driven neural network-based receiver, designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems and suitable for implementation at the RAN edge. The proposed solution is compliant with the 5G New Radio (5G NR), and supports different modulation schemes, bandwidths, number of users, and number of base-station antennas with a single trained model without the need for further training. Numerical simulations of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) processing show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable Transport Block Error Rate (TBLER), while reducing the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) by 66$\times$, and the learnable parameters by 396$\times$.</description>

      <title>Interference-Asymmetric UAV Remote Control Links: Measurements and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and secure connectivity is crucial for remote control (RC) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) links. A major problem for UAV RC links is that interference sources within the coverage may degrade the link quality. Such interference problems are a higher concern for the UAV than the RC unit on the ground due to the UAV being in line of sight (LoS) with a larger number of interference sources. As a result, lost hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) indicators (ACK/NACK) feedback in the uplink (UL, RC to UAV) may degrade the downlink (DL, UAV to RC) throughput. To get physical evidence for our interference asymmetry argument, we first conducted a measurement campaign using a helikite platform at the Main Campus area of NC State University during the 2024 Packapalooza festival. Subsequently, we evaluated the throughput impact of the loss of HARQ indicator feedback caused by UL asymmetry using MATLAB long-term-evolution (LTE) and fifth-generation (5G) toolboxes. Our numerical results confirm that UL interference asymmetry substantially degrades the throughput performance due to the loss of HARQ indicator feedback.</description>

      <title>A Novel CNN Based Standalone Detector for Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector for faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, introducing structured fixed kernel layers with domain-informed masking to effectively mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI). Unlike standard CNN architectures that rely on moving kernels, the proposed approach employs fixed convolutional kernels at predefined positions to explicitly learn ISI patterns at varying distances from the central symbol. To enhance feature extraction, a hierarchical filter allocation strategy is employed, assigning more filters to earlier layers for stronger ISI components and fewer to later layers for weaker components. This structured design improves feature representation, eliminates redundant computations, and enhances detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed detector achieves near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance, comparable to the BCJR algorithm for the compression factor $\tau \geq 0.7$, while offering up to $46\%$ and $84\%$ computational cost reduction over M-BCJR for BPSK and QPSK, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm the method's adaptability to high-order modulations (up to 64-QAM), resilience in quasi-static multipath Rayleigh fading channels, and effectiveness under LDPC-coded FTN transmission, highlighting its robustness and practicality.</description>

      <title>Wavefield Correlation Imaging in Arbitrary Media with Inherent Aberration Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is an indispensable tool for diagnostic imaging, particularly given its cost, safety, and portability profiles compared to other modalities. However, US is challenged in subjects with morphological heterogeneity (e.g., those with overweight or obesity), largely because conventional imaging algorithms do not account for such variation in the beamforming process. Specific knowledge of the these spatial variations enables supplemental corrections of these algorithms, but with added computational complexity. Wavefield correlation imaging (WCI) enables efficient image formation in the spatial frequency domain that, in its canonical formulation, assumes a uniform medium. In this work, we present an extension of WCI to arbitrary known speed-of-sound distributions directly in the image formation process, and demonstrate its feasibility in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. We report resolution improvements of over 30% and contrast improvements of order 10% over conventional WCI imaging. Together our results suggest heterogeneous WCI (HWCI) may have high translational potential to improve the objective quality, and thus clinical utility, of ultrasound images.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Leakage Minimization Beamforming for Large-scale Multi-user Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a low-complexity beamforming (BF) design for information leakage minimization in multi-user (MU) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. Our approach leverages fractional programming (FP) to reformulate the secrecy rate maximization problem into a tractable difference-of-convex form. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, we employ the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCP), enabling fast convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves secrecy rates comparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) methods, while significantly reducing computational complexity and improving convergence speed.</description>

      <title>BeamSeek: Deep Learning-based DOA Estimation for Low-Complexity mmWave Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach combining agile beam switching with deep learning to enhance the speed and accuracy of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for millimeter-wave (mmWave) phased array systems with low-complexity hardware implementations is proposed and evaluated. Traditional DOA methods requiring direct access to individual antenna elements are impractical for analog or hybrid beamforming systems prevalent in modern mmWave implementations. Recent agile beam switching techniques have demonstrated rapid DOA estimation, but their accuracy and robustness can be further improved via deep learning. BeamSeek addresses these limitations by employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and specialized data augmentation that emulates real-world propagation conditions. The proposed approach was experimentally validated at 60 GHz using the NSF PAWR COSMOS testbed, demonstrating significant improvements over a correlation-based method across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Results show that BeamSeek achieves up to an 8 degree reduction in average estimation error compared to this baseline, with particular advantages in noisy channels. This makes it especially suitable for practical mmWave deployments in environments characterized by multipath interference and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Stretchable and self-adhesive triboelectric sensor for real-time musculoskeletal monitoring and personalized recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical diagnostics have highlighted the importance of wearable technologies for continuous and real-time physiological monitoring. In this study, we introduce a flexible, self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator (MB-TENG) engineered from commercially available medical elastic bandages for biomechanical sensing during rehabilitation and gait analysis. Leveraging the porous and skin-friendly properties of the bandage combined with a PTFE film, the MB-TENG delivers robust electrical performance, achieving a peak open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 122~V, a short-circuit current (ISC) of 25~$\mu$A, and a transferred charge (QSC) of 110~nC, while maintaining long-term stability across 40{,}000 mechanical cycles. Its inherent self-adhesive property allows for multi-layer assembly without extra bonding agents, and mechanical stretching enhances output, enabling dual configurability. A stacked design further improves the power capacity, supporting applications in wearable medical electronics. The MB-TENG device seamlessly conforms to joint surfaces and foot regions, providing accurate detection of motion states and abnormal gait patterns. These features underscore the MB-TENG's potential as a low-cost, scalable platform for personalized rehabilitation, injury monitoring, and early musculoskeletal diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learning for Pilot Decontamination in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pilot contamination (PC) arises when the pilot sequences assigned to user equipments (UEs) are not mutually orthogonal, eventually due to their reuse. In this work, we propose a novel expectation propagation (EP)-based joint channel estimation and data detection (JCD) algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the effects of PC in the uplink of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MaMIMO) systems. This modified bilinear-EP algorithm is distributed, scalable, demonstrates strong robustness to PC, and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian learning algorithms. Through a comprehensive performance evaluation, we assess the performance of Bayesian learning algorithms for different pilot sequences and observe that the use of non-orthogonal pilots can lead to better performance compared to shared orthogonal sequences. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce a new metric to quantify PC at the UE level. We show that the performance of the considered algorithms degrades monotonically with respect to this metric, providing a valuable theoretical and practical tool for understanding and managing PC via iterative JCD algorithms.</description>

      <title>MASSLOC: A Massive Sound Source Localization System based on Direction-of-Arrival Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic indoor localization offers the potential for highly accurate position estimation while generally exhibiting low hardware requirements compared to Radio Frequency (RF)-based solutions. Furthermore, angular-based localization significantly reduces installation effort by minimizing the number of required fixed anchor nodes. In this contribution, we propose the so-called MASSLOC system, which leverages sparse two-dimensional array geometries to localize and identify a large number of concurrently active sources. Additionally, the use of complementary Zadoff-Chu sequences is introduced to enable efficient, beamforming-based source identification. These sequences provide a trade-off between favorable correlation properties and accurate, unsynchronized direction-of-arrival estimation by exhibiting a spectrally balanced waveform. The system is evaluated in both a controlled anechoic chamber and a highly reverberant lobby environment with a reverberation time of 1.6 s. In a laboratory setting, successful direction-of-arrival estimation and identification of up to 14 simultaneously emitting sources are demonstrated. Adopting a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) calibration approach, the system achieves a median three-dimensional localization error of 55.7 mm and a median angular error of 0.84 deg with dynamic source movement of up to 1.9 mps in the challenging reverberant environment. The multi-source capability is also demonstrated and evaluated in that environment with a total of three tags. These results indicate the scalability and robustness of the MASSLOC system, even under challenging acoustic conditions.</description>

      <title>Means of Random Variables in Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of mean (i.e., average) and covariance of a random variable are fundamental in statistics, and are used to solve real-world problems such as those that arise in robotics, computer vision, and medical imaging. On matrix Lie groups, multiple competing definitions of the mean arise, including the Euclidean, projected, distance-based (i.e., Fr\'echet and Karcher), group-theoretic, and parametric means. This article provides a comprehensive review of these definitions, investigates their relationships to each other, and determines the conditions under which the group-theoretic means minimize a least-squares type cost function. We also highlight the dependence of these definitions on the choice of inner product on the Lie algebra. The goal of this article is to guide practitioners in selecting an appropriate notion of the mean in applications involving matrix Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed Asynchronous ADMM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) serves as an attractive option for large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of objective functions. However, communication costs can become a major bottleneck when the nodes have limited communication budgets or when the data to be communicated is prohibitively large. In this work, we propose introducing coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and distributed optimization applications. We experimentally verify the convergence of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural networks.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Limit of the Output of IIR Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic distribution of the output of a stable Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system driven by a non-Gaussian stochastic input. Motivated by longstanding heuristics in the stochastic describing function method, we rigorously characterize when the output process becomes approximately Gaussian, even when the input is not. Using the Wasserstein-1 distance as a quantitative measure of non-Gaussianity, we derive upper bounds on the distance between the appropriately scaled output and a standard normal distribution. These bounds are obtained via Stein's method and depend explicitly on the system's impulse response and the dependence structure of the input process. We show that when the dominant pole of the system approaches the edge of stability and the input satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) independence, (ii) positive correlation with a real and positive dominant pole, or (iii) sufficient correlation decay, the output converges to a standard normal distribution at rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We also present counterexamples where convergence fails, thereby motivating the stated assumptions. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for the widespread observation that outputs of low-pass LTI systems tend to be approximately Gaussian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.</description>

      <title>Interpretable and Robust AI in EEG Systems: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10755v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The close coupling of artificial intelligence (AI) and electroencephalography (EEG) has substantially advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies in the AI era. Different from traditional EEG systems, the interpretability and robustness of AI-based EEG systems are becoming particularly crucial. The interpretability clarifies the inner working mechanisms of AI models and thus can gain the trust of users. The robustness reflects the AI's reliability against attacks and perturbations, which is essential for sensitive and fragile EEG signals. Thus the interpretability and robustness of AI in EEG systems have attracted increasing attention, and their research has achieved great progress recently. However, there is still no survey covering recent advances in this field. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey and summarize the interpretable and robust AI techniques for EEG systems. Specifically, we first propose a taxonomy of interpretability by characterizing it into three types: backpropagation, perturbation, and inherently interpretable methods. Then we classify the robustness mechanisms into four classes: noise and artifacts, human variability, data acquisition instability, and adversarial attacks. Finally, we identify several critical and unresolved challenges for interpretable and robust AI in EEG systems and further discuss their future directions.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-ISAC System With 1-Bit ADCs/DACs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hardware-efficient massive multiple-input multiple-output integrated sensing and communication (MIMO-ISAC) system with 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The proposed system, referred to as 1BitISAC, employs 1-bit DACs at the ISAC transmitter and 1-bit ADCs at the sensing receiver, achieving significant reductions in power consumption and hardware costs. For such kind of systems, two 1BitISAC joint transceiver designs, i.e., i) quality of service constrained 1BitISAC design and ii) quality of detection constrained design, are considered and the corresponding problems are formulated. In order to address these problems, we thoroughly analyze the radar detection performance after 1-bit ADCs quantization and the communication bit error rate. This analysis yields new design insights and leads to unique radar and communication metrics, which enables us to simplify the original problems and employ majorization-minimization and integer linear programming methods to solve the problems. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance analysis of the proposed 1BitISAC and to compare with other ISAC configurations. The superiority of the proposed 1BitISAC system in terms of balancing ISAC performance and energy efficiency is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling Allocation Strategies for General Graph-Filter-Based Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensor placement plays a crucial role in graph signal recovery in underdetermined systems. In this paper, we present the graph-filtered regularized maximum likelihood (GFR-ML) estimator of graph signals, which integrates general graph filtering with regularization to enhance signal recovery performance under a limited number of sensors. Then, we investigate task-based sampling allocation aimed at minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the GFR-ML estimator by wisely choosing sensor placement. Since this MSE depends on the unknown graph signals to be estimated, we propose four cost functions for the optimization of the sampling allocation: the biased Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao bound (bCRB), the worst-case MSE (WC-MSE), the Bayesian MSE (BMSE), and the worst-case BMSE (WC-BMSE), where the last two assume a Gaussian prior. We investigate the properties of these cost functions and develop two algorithms for their practical implementation: 1) the straightforward greedy algorithm; and 2) the alternating projection gradient descent (PGD) algorithm that reduces the computational complexity. Simulation results on synthetic and real-world datasets of the IEEE 118-bus power system and the Minnesota road network demonstrate that, in the tested scenarios, the proposed sampling allocation methods reduce the MSE by up to $50\%$ compared to the common sampling methods A-design, E-design, and LR-design. Thus, the proposed methods improve the estimation performance and reduce the required number of measurements in graph signal processing (GSP)-based signal recovery in the case of underdetermined systems.</description>

      <title>TEANet: A Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network for Wearable Stress Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental stress poses a significant public health concern due to its detrimental effects on physical and mental well-being, necessitating the development of continuous stress monitoring tools for wearable devices. Blood volume pulse (BVP) sensors, readily available in many smartwatches, offer a convenient and cost-effective solution for stress monitoring. This study presents a deep learning approach, a Transpose-Enhanced Autoencoder Network (TEANet), for stress detection using BVP signals on resource-constrained devices. The proposed TEANet model was trained and validated utilizing a self-developed RUET SPML dataset, and the publicly available wearable stress and affect detection (WESAD) dataset. It achieves the highest accuracy of 92.94% and 96.94%, F1 scores of 95.16% and 95.95%, and kappa of 0.8181 and 0.9350 for RUET SPML, and WESAD datasets, respectively. The proposed TEANet effectively detects mental stress through BVP signals with high accuracy, making it a promising tool for continuous stress monitoring. Furthermore, deploying the proposed model on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ enhances its potential for reliable real-time stress monitoring using resource-constrained devices.</description>

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets with application to signal recovery from the second moment and cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-algebraic priors are ubiquitous in signal processing and machine learning. Prevalent examples include a) linear models where the signal lies in a low-dimensional subspace; b) sparse models where the signal can be represented by only a few coefficients under a suitable basis; and c) a large family of neural network generative models. In this paper, we prove a transversality theorem for semi-algebraic sets in orthogonal or unitary representations of groups: with a suitable dimension bound, a generic translate of any semi-algebraic set is transverse to the orbits of the group action. This, in turn, implies that if a signal lies in a low-dimensional semi-algebraic set, then it can be recovered uniquely from measurements that separate orbits.
  As an application, we consider the implications of the transversality theorem to the problem of recovering signals that are translated by random group actions from their second moment. As a special case, we discuss cryo-EM: a leading technology to constitute the spatial structure of biological molecules, which serves as our prime motivation. In particular, we derive explicit bounds for recovering a molecular structure from the second moment under a semi-algebraic prior and deduce information-theoretic implications. We also obtain information-theoretic bounds for three additional applications: factoring Gram matrices, multi-reference alignment, and phase retrieval. Finally, we deduce bounds for designing permutation invariant separators in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

      <title>On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method in anomaly detection, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest F1-score in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, with an F1-score scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 \textmu J during inference.

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Optical Wireless Ether: Enabling Controlled Dynamic Signal Propagation in OWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) leverages the terahertz-scale optical spectrum to enable ultra-fast data transfer, offering a compelling alternative to often-congested radio frequency systems. However, the highly directional nature of optical signals and their susceptibility to obstruction inherently limit coverage and reliability, particularly in dynamic indoor environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose optical wireless ether (OWE), a novel framework that transforms indoor spaces into a dynamically controllable optical propagation medium. OWE employs a distributed network of ether amplifiers (EAs), which act as optical amplifiers with programmable gain values to extend coverage through diffuse reflections while compensating for signal attenuation. A key challenge in OWE is preventing amplifier saturation from feedback loops. We rigorously derive stability constraints to guarantee system robustness. Beyond coverage extension, OWE dynamically adjusts EA gains in response to user locations and channel conditions, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, balancing resource allocation, and suppressing interference. As the first framework to harness diffuse reflection for controllable optical propagation, we validate OWE's effectiveness through analytical modeling, simulations, and prototyping. Our work lays the foundation for robust, high-speed indoor OWC networks.</description>
