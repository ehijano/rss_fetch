      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>Uniturbulence and Alfven wave solar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AWSOM-type models (Van der Holst et al. 2014) have been very successful in describing the solar atmosphere by incorporating the Alfven wave driving as extra contributions in the global MHD equations. However, they lack the contributions from other wave modes. In this paper, we aim to write governing equations for the energy evolution equation of kink waves. In a similar manner as AWSOM, we combine the kink wave evolution equation with MHD. Our goal is to incorporate the extra heating provided by the uniturbulent damping of the kink waves. We attempt to construct the UAWSOM equations (uniturbulence and Alfven wave driven solar models). We have recently described the MHD equations in terms of the Q-variables. These latter variables allow to follow the evolution of waves in a co-propagating reference frame. We transform the Q-variable MHD equations into an energy evolution equation. First we do this generally, and then we specialise to the description of kink waves. We also couple this evolution equation to the slowly varying MHD formulation and solve the system in 1D. We find that the kink wave energy evolution equation contains non-linear terms, even in the absence of counterpropagating waves. The non-linear damping is expressed solely through equilibrium parameters, rather than an ad-hoc perpendicular correlation term, as in the case of the AWSOM models. A proof-of-concept numerical implementation in python shows that the kink wave driving indeed leads to radial outflow and heating. Thus, UAWSOM may have the necessary ingredients to drive the solar wind and heat the solar corona against losses. Not only does our current work constitute a pathway to fix shortcomings in heating and wind driving in the popular AWSOM model, it also provides the mathematical formalism to incorporate more wave modes for additional driving of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>The long-term solar variability, as reconstructed from historical sources: Several case studies in the 17th -- 18th centuries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a centennial timescale, solar activity was quantified based on records of instrumental sunspot observations. This article briefly discusses several aspects of the recent archival investigations of historical sunspot records in the 17th to 18th centuries. This article also reviews the recent updates for the active day fraction and positions of the reported sunspot groups of the Maunder Minimum to show their significance within the observational history. These archival investigations serve as base datasets for reconstructing solar activity.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>

Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the inner heliosphere, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>
