      <title>Algorithmic Fairness in Performative Policy Learning: Escaping the Impossibility of Group Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many prediction problems, the predictive model affects the distribution of the prediction target. This phenomenon is known as performativity and is often caused by the behavior of individuals with vested interests in the outcome of the predictive model. Although performativity is generally problematic because it manifests as distribution shifts, we develop algorithmic fairness practices that leverage performativity to achieve stronger group fairness guarantees in social classification problems (compared to what is achievable in non-performative settings). In particular, we leverage the policymaker's ability to steer the population to remedy inequities in the long term. A crucial benefit of this approach is that it is possible to resolve the incompatibilities between conflicting group fairness definitions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Robust Satisficing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robust Satisficing (RS) model is an emerging approach to robust optimization, offering streamlined procedures and robust generalization across various applications. However, the statistical theory of RS remains unexplored in the literature. This paper fills in the gap by comprehensively analyzing the theoretical properties of the RS model. Notably, the RS structure offers a more straightforward path to deriving statistical guarantees compared to the seminal Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), resulting in a richer set of results. In particular, we establish two-sided confidence intervals for the optimal loss without the need to solve a minimax optimization problem explicitly. We further provide finite-sample generalization error bounds for the RS optimizer. Importantly, our results extend to scenarios involving distribution shifts, where discrepancies exist between the sampling and target distributions. Our numerical experiments show that the RS model consistently outperforms the baseline empirical risk minimization in small-sample regimes and under distribution shifts. Furthermore, compared to the DRO model, the RS model exhibits lower sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its practicability for robustness considerations.</description>

      <title>Rough Transformers: Lightweight Continuous-Time Sequence Modelling with Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose \textit{multi-view signature attention}, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.</description>

      <title>PUAL: A Classifier on Trifurcate Positive-Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a classifier using the data containing only labeled-positive instances and unlabeled instances. However, existing PU learning methods are generally hard to achieve satisfactory performance on trifurcate data, where the positive instances distribute on both sides of the negative instances. To address this issue, firstly we propose a PU classifier with asymmetric loss (PUAL), by introducing a structure of asymmetric loss on positive instances into the objective function of the global and local learning classifier. Then we develop a kernel-based algorithm to enable PUAL to obtain non-linear decision boundary. We show that, through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets, PUAL can achieve satisfactory classification on trifurcate data.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergences of Lie Group Momentum Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit, momentum-based dynamics that optimize functions defined on Lie groups can be constructed via variational optimization and momentum trivialization. Structure preserving time discretizations can then turn this dynamics into optimization algorithms. This article investigates two types of discretization, Lie Heavy-Ball, which is a known splitting scheme, and Lie NAG-SC, which is newly proposed. Their convergence rates are explicitly quantified under $L$-smoothness and local strong convexity assumptions. Lie NAG-SC provides acceleration over the momentumless case, i.e. Riemannian gradient descent, but Lie Heavy-Ball does not. When compared to existing accelerated optimizers for general manifolds, both Lie Heavy-Ball and Lie NAG-SC are computationally cheaper and easier to implement, thanks to their utilization of group structure. Only gradient oracle and exponential map are required, but not logarithm map or parallel transport which are computational costly.</description>

      <title>Fast leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation by clustered Network Information Criteria (NICc)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduced a clustered estimator of the Network Information Criterion (NICc) to approximate leave-one-cluster-out cross-validated deviance, which can be used as an alternative to cluster-based cross-validation when modeling clustered data. Stone proved that Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is an asymptotic equivalence to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation if the parametric model is true. Ripley pointed out that the Network Information Criterion (NIC) derived in Stone's proof, is a better approximation to leave-one-observation-out cross-validation when the model is not true. For clustered data, we derived a clustered estimator of NIC, referred to as NICc, by substituting the Fisher information matrix in NIC with its estimator that adjusts for clustering. This adjustment imposes a larger penalty in NICc than the unclustered estimator of NIC when modeling clustered data, thereby preventing overfitting more effectively. In a simulation study and an empirical example, we used linear and logistic regression to model clustered data with Gaussian or binomial response, respectively. We showed that NICc is a better approximation to leave-one-cluster-out deviance and prevents overfitting more effectively than AIC and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). NICc leads to more accurate model selection, as determined by cluster-based cross-validation, compared to AIC and BIC.</description>

      <title>Private Mean Estimation with Person-Level Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each person holds multiple samples. Commonly referred to as the "user-level" setting, DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when all of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have $m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th moments, we show that
  \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d }{ \alpha m^{1/2} \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\]
  people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance $\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally efficient algorithms under approximate DP (with slightly degraded sample complexity) and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the well known noisy-clipped-mean approach, but the analysis for our setting requires new bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments random variables, and a new argument for bounding the bias introduced by clipping.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Computing Convergence Rates of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in (Qu et.al, 2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>Understanding Encoder-Decoder Structures in Machine Learning Using Information Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new results to model and understand the role of encoder-decoder design in machine learning (ML) from an information-theoretic angle. We use two main information concepts, information sufficiency (IS) and mutual information loss (MIL), to represent predictive structures in machine learning. Our first main result provides a functional expression that characterizes the class of probabilistic models consistent with an IS encoder-decoder latent predictive structure. This result formally justifies the encoder-decoder forward stages many modern ML architectures adopt to learn latent (compressed) representations for classification. To illustrate IS as a realistic and relevant model assumption, we revisit some known ML concepts and present some interesting new examples: invariant, robust, sparse, and digital models. Furthermore, our IS characterization allows us to tackle the fundamental question of how much performance (predictive expressiveness) could be lost, using the cross entropy risk, when a given encoder-decoder architecture is adopted in a learning setting. Here, our second main result shows that a mutual information loss quantifies the lack of expressiveness attributed to the choice of a (biased) encoder-decoder ML design. Finally, we address the problem of universal cross-entropy learning with an encoder-decoder design where necessary and sufficiency conditions are established to meet this requirement. In all these results, Shannon's information measures offer new interpretations and explanations for representation learning.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Structure Between Environments: Phylogenetic Regularization Incentivizes Disentangled Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many causal systems such as biological processes in cells can only be observed indirectly via measurements, such as gene expression. Causal representation learning -- the task of correctly mapping low-level observations to latent causal variables -- could advance scientific understanding by enabling inference of latent variables such as pathway activation. In this paper, we develop methods for inferring latent variables from multiple related datasets (environments) and tasks. As a running example, we consider the task of predicting a phenotype from gene expression, where we often collect data from multiple cell types or organisms that are related in known ways. The key insight is that the mapping from latent variables driven by gene expression to the phenotype of interest changes sparsely across closely related environments. To model sparse changes, we introduce Tree-Based Regularization (TBR), an objective that minimizes both prediction error and regularizes closely related environments to learn similar predictors. We prove that under assumptions about the degree of sparse changes, TBR identifies the true latent variables up to some simple transformations. We evaluate the theory empirically with both simulations and ground-truth gene expression data. We find that TBR recovers the latent causal variables better than related methods across these settings, even under settings that violate some assumptions of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an online learning algorithm that obtains regret $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T\log(\|w_\star\|G\sqrt{T})} + \|w_\star\|^2 + G^2$ on $G$-Lipschitz convex losses for any comparison point $w_\star$ without knowing either $G$ or $\|w_\star\|$. Importantly, this matches the optimal bound $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T}$ available with such knowledge (up to logarithmic factors), unless either $\|w_\star\|$ or $G$ is so large that even $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T}$ is roughly linear in $T$. Thus, it matches the optimal bound in all cases in which one can achieve sublinear regret, which arguably most "interesting" scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Connection Between Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization with the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence (NMF) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are two popular approaches for dimensionality reduction of non-negative data. Here, we show that NMF with $\ell_1$ normalization constraints on the columns of both matrices of the decomposition and a Dirichlet prior on the columns of one matrix is equivalent to LDA. To show this, we demonstrate that explicitly accounting for the scaling ambiguity of NMF by adding $\ell_1$ normalization constraints to the optimization problem allows a joint update of both matrices in the widely used multiplicative updates (MU) algorithm. When both of the matrices are normalized, the joint MU algorithm leads to probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), which is LDA without a Dirichlet prior. Our approach of deriving joint updates for NMF also reveals that a Lasso penalty on one matrix together with an $\ell_1$ normalization constraint on the other matrix is insufficient to induce any sparsity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete and statistically consistent uncertainty quantification for deep learning is provided, including the sources of uncertainty arising from (1) the new input data, (2) the training and testing data (3) the weight vectors of the neural network, and (4) the neural network because it is not a perfect predictor. Using Bayes Theorem and conditional probability densities, we demonstrate how each uncertainty source can be systematically quantified. We also introduce a fast and practical way to incorporate and combine all sources of errors for the first time. For illustration, the new method is applied to quantify errors in cloud autoconversion rates, predicted from an artificial neural network that was trained by aircraft cloud probe measurements in the Azores and the stochastic collection equation formulated as a two-moment bin model. For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights. We discuss the usefulness of the methodology for machine learning practice, and how, through inclusion of uncertainty in the training data, the new methodology is less sensitive to input data that falls outside of the training data set.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generative Molecular Design via Uncertainty-guided Fine-tuning of Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep generative models have been successfully adopted for various molecular design tasks, particularly in the life and material sciences. A critical challenge for pre-trained generative molecular design (GMD) models is to fine-tune them to be better suited for downstream design tasks aimed at optimizing specific molecular properties. However, redesigning and training an existing effective generative model from scratch for each new design task is impractical. Furthermore, the black-box nature of typical downstream tasks$\unicode{x2013}$such as property prediction$\unicode{x2013}$makes it nontrivial to optimize the generative model in a task-specific manner. In this work, we propose a novel approach for a model uncertainty-guided fine-tuning of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE)-based GMD model through performance feedback in an active learning setting. The main idea is to quantify model uncertainty in the generative model, which is made efficient by working within a low-dimensional active subspace of the high-dimensional VAE parameters explaining most of the variability in the model's output. The inclusion of model uncertainty expands the space of viable molecules through decoder diversity. We then explore the resulting model uncertainty class via black-box optimization made tractable by low-dimensionality of the active subspace. This enables us to identify and leverage a diverse set of high-performing models to generate enhanced molecules. Empirical results across six target molecular properties, using multiple VAE-based generative models, demonstrate that our uncertainty-guided fine-tuning approach consistently outperforms the original pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Principal-Agent Multitasking: the Uniformity of Optimal Contracts and its Efficient Learning via Instrumental Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the multitasking principal-agent problem. I first show a ``uniformity'' result. Specifically, when the tasks are perfect substitutes, and the agent's cost function is homogeneous to a certain degree, then the optimal contract only depends on the marginal utility of each task and the degree of homogeneity. I then study a setting where the marginal utility of each task is unknown so that the optimal contract must be learned or estimated with observational data. I identify this problem as a regression problem with measurement errors and observe that this problem can be cast as an instrumental regression problem. The current works observe that both the contract and the repeated observations (when available) can act as valid instrumental variables, and propose using the generalized method of moments estimator to compute an approximately optimal contract from offline data. I also study an online setting and show how the optimal contract can be efficiently learned in an online fashion using the two estimators. Here the principal faces an exploration-exploitation tradeoff: she must experiment with new contracts and observe their outcome whilst at the same time ensuring her experimentations are not deviating too much from the optimal contract. This work shows when repeated observations are available and agents are sufficiently ``diverse", the principal can achieve a very low $\widetilde{O}(d)$ cumulative utility loss, even with a ``pure exploitation" algorithm.</description>

      <title>Statistical inference for case-control logistic regression via integrating external summary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Case-control sampling is a commonly used retrospective sampling design to alleviate imbalanced structure of binary data. When fitting the logistic regression model with case-control data, although the slope parameter of the model can be consistently estimated, the intercept parameter is not identifiable, and the marginal case proportion is not estimatable, either. We consider the situations in which besides the case-control data from the main study, called internal study, there also exists summary-level information from related external studies. An empirical likelihood based approach is proposed to make inference for the logistic model by incorporating the internal case-control data and external information. We show that the intercept parameter is identifiable with the help of external information, and then all the regression parameters as well as the marginal case proportion can be estimated consistently. The proposed method also accounts for the possible variability in external studies. The resultant estimators are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix can be consistently estimated by the case-control data. The optimal way to utilized external information is discussed. Simulation studies are conducted to verify the theoretical findings. A real data set is analyzed for illustration.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Interactive-Grounded Learning with Personalized Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive-Grounded Learning (IGL) [Xie et al., 2021] is a powerful framework in which a learner aims at maximizing unobservable rewards through interacting with an environment and observing reward-dependent feedback on the taken actions. To deal with personalized rewards that are ubiquitous in applications such as recommendation systems, Maghakian et al. [2022] study a version of IGL with context-dependent feedback, but their algorithm does not come with theoretical guarantees. In this work, we consider the same problem and provide the first provably efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under realizability. Our analysis reveals that the step-function estimator of prior work can deviate uncontrollably due to finite-sample effects. Our solution is a novel Lipschitz reward estimator which underestimates the true reward and enjoys favorable generalization performances. Building on this estimator, we propose two algorithms, one based on explore-then-exploit and the other based on inverse-gap weighting. We apply IGL to learning from image feedback and learning from text feedback, which are reward-free settings that arise in practice. Experimental results showcase the importance of using our Lipschitz reward estimator and the overall effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Learning for Fair Multi-Agent Social Welfare Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of online multi-agent Nash social welfare (NSW) maximization. While previous works of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023] study similar problems in stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits and show that $\sqrt{T}$-regret is possible after $T$ rounds, their fairness measure is the product of all agents' rewards, instead of their NSW (that is, their geometric mean). Given the fundamental role of NSW in the fairness literature, it is more than natural to ask whether no-regret fair learning with NSW as the objective is possible. In this work, we provide a complete answer to this question in various settings. Specifically, in stochastic $N$-agent $K$-armed bandits, we develop an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(K^{\frac{2}{N}}T^{\frac{N-1}{N}}\right)$ regret and prove that the dependence on $T$ is tight, making it a sharp contrast to the $\sqrt{T}$-regret bounds of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023]. We then consider a more challenging version of the problem with adversarial rewards. Somewhat surprisingly, despite NSW being a concave function, we prove that no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret. To circumvent such negative results, we further consider a setting with full-information feedback and design two algorithms with $\sqrt{T}$-regret: the first one has no dependence on $N$ at all and is applicable to not just NSW but a broad class of welfare functions, while the second one has better dependence on $K$ and is preferable when $N$ is small. Finally, we also show that logarithmic regret is possible whenever there exists one agent who is indifferent about different arms.</description>

      <title>Learning on Large Graphs using Intersecting Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a staple of graph machine learning. MPNNs iteratively update each node's representation in an input graph by aggregating messages from the node's neighbors, which necessitates a memory complexity of the order of the number of graph edges. This complexity might quickly become prohibitive for large graphs provided they are not very sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem by approximating the input graph as an intersecting community graph (ICG) -- a combination of intersecting cliques. The key insight is that the number of communities required to approximate a graph does not depend on the graph size. We develop a new constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma to efficiently construct an approximating ICG for any input graph. We then devise an efficient graph learning algorithm operating directly on ICG in linear memory and time with respect to the number of nodes (rather than edges). This offers a new and fundamentally different pipeline for learning on very large non-sparse graphs, whose applicability is demonstrated empirically on node classification tasks and spatio-temporal data processing.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization and Convergence by Enhancing Implicit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with {\em generic base optimizers} without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also achieves a $2\times$ {\em speed-up} compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).</description>

      <title>Avoiding Pitfalls for Privacy Accounting of Subsampled Mechanisms under Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing tight privacy guarantees for the composition of subsampled differentially private mechanisms. Recent algorithms can numerically compute the privacy parameters to arbitrary precision but must be carefully applied.
  Our main contribution is to address two common points of confusion. First, some privacy accountants assume that the privacy guarantees for the composition of a subsampled mechanism are determined by self-composing the worst-case datasets for the uncomposed mechanism. We show that this is not true in general. Second, Poisson subsampling is sometimes assumed to have similar privacy guarantees compared to sampling without replacement. We show that the privacy guarantees may in fact differ significantly between the two sampling schemes. In particular, we give an example of hyperparameters that result in $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for Poisson subsampling and $\varepsilon &gt; 10$ for sampling without replacement. This occurs for some parameters that could realistically be chosen for DP-SGD.</description>

      <title>Universal Exact Compression of Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Pursuing Overall Welfare in Federated Learning through Sequential Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional federated learning, a single global model cannot perform equally well for all clients. Therefore, the need to achieve the client-level fairness in federated system has been emphasized, which can be realized by modifying the static aggregation scheme for updating the global model to an adaptive one, in response to the local signals of the participating clients. Our work reveals that existing fairness-aware aggregation strategies can be unified into an online convex optimization framework, in other words, a central server's sequential decision making process. To enhance the decision making capability, we propose simple and intuitive improvements for suboptimal designs within existing methods, presenting AAggFF. Considering practical requirements, we further subdivide our method tailored for the cross-device and the cross-silo settings, respectively. Theoretical analyses guarantee sublinear regret upper bounds for both settings: $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log{K}})$ for the cross-device setting, and $\mathcal{O}(K \log{T})$ for the cross-silo setting, with $K$ clients and $T$ federation rounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the federated system equipped with AAggFF achieves better degree of client-level fairness than existing methods in both practical settings.

      <title>Online Convex Optimisation: The Optimal Switching Regret for all Segmentations Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classic problem of online convex optimisation. Whereas the notion of static regret is relevant for stationary problems, the notion of switching regret is more appropriate for non-stationary problems. A switching regret is defined relative to any segmentation of the trial sequence, and is equal to the sum of the static regrets of each segment. In this paper we show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can achieve the asymptotically optimal switching regret on every possible segmentation simultaneously. Our algorithm for doing so is very efficient: having a space and per-trial time complexity that is logarithmic in the time-horizon. Our algorithm also obtains novel bounds on its dynamic regret: being adaptive to variations in the rate of change of the comparator sequence.</description>

      <title>einspace: Searching for Neural Architectures from Fundamental Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren't diverse enough to include such transformations a priori. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification in linear non-Gaussian causal models under general confounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear non-Gaussian causal models postulate that each random variable is a linear function of parent variables and non-Gaussian exogenous error terms. We study identification of the linear coefficients when such models contain latent variables. Our focus is on the commonly studied acyclic setting, where each model corresponds to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For this case, prior literature has demonstrated that connections to overcomplete independent component analysis yield effective criteria to decide parameter identifiability in latent variable models. However, this connection is based on the assumption that the observed variables linearly depend on the latent variables. Departing from this assumption, we treat models that allow for arbitrary non-linear latent confounding. Our main result is a graphical criterion that is necessary and sufficient for deciding the generic identifiability of direct causal effects. Moreover, we provide an algorithmic implementation of the criterion with a run time that is polynomial in the number of observed variables. Finally, we report on estimation heuristics based on the identification result, explore a generalization to models with feedback loops, and provide new results on the identifiability of the causal graph.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonparametric regression problem when the covariates are located on an unknown smooth compact submanifold of a Euclidean space. Under defining a random geometric graph structure over the covariates we analyze the asymptotic frequentist behaviour of the posterior distribution arising from Bayesian priors designed through random basis expansion in the graph Laplacian eigenbasis. Under Holder smoothness assumption on the regression function and the density of the covariates over the submanifold, we prove that the posterior contraction rates of such methods are minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any positive smoothness index.</description>

      <title>Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling machine learning models significantly improves their performance. However, such gains come at the cost of inference being slow and resource-intensive. Early-exit neural networks (EENNs) offer a promising solution: they accelerate inference by allowing intermediate layers to exit and produce a prediction early. Yet a fundamental issue with EENNs is how to determine when to exit without severely degrading performance. In other words, when is it 'safe' for an EENN to go 'fast'? To address this issue, we investigate how to adapt frameworks of risk control to EENNs. Risk control offers a distribution-free, post-hoc solution that tunes the EENN's exiting mechanism so that exits only occur when the output is of sufficient quality. We empirically validate our insights on a range of vision and language tasks, demonstrating that risk control can produce substantial computational savings, all the while preserving user-specified performance goals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked datasets are often enriched by different types of information about individual nodes or edges. However, most existing methods for analyzing such datasets struggle to handle the complexity of heterogeneous data, often requiring substantial model-specific analysis. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic generative model to perform inference in multilayer networks with arbitrary types of information. Our approach employs a Bayesian framework combined with the Laplace matching technique to ease interpretation of inferred parameters. Furthermore, the algorithmic implementation relies on automatic differentiation, avoiding the need for explicit derivations. This makes our model scalable and flexible to adapt to any combination of input data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting overlapping community structures and performing various prediction tasks on heterogeneous multilayer data, where nodes and edges have different types of attributes. Additionally, we showcase its ability to unveil a variety of patterns in a social support network among villagers in rural India by effectively utilizing all input information in a meaningful way.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the Optimized Certainty Equivalent (OCE) risk from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. For the classic sample average approximation (SAA) of OCE, we derive mean-squared error as well as concentration bounds (assuming sub-Gaussianity). Further, we analyze an efficient stochastic approximation-based OCE estimator, and derive finite sample bounds for the same. To show the applicability of our bounds, we consider a risk-aware bandit problem, with OCE as the risk. For this problem, we derive bound on the probability of mis-identification. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Aligning Multiclass Neural Network Classifier Criterion with Task Performance via $F_\beta$-Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiclass neural network classifiers are typically trained using cross-entropy loss. Following training, the performance of this same neural network is evaluated using an application-specific metric based on the multiclass confusion matrix, such as the Macro $F_\beta$-Score. It is questionable whether the use of cross-entropy will yield a classifier that aligns with the intended application-specific performance criteria, particularly in scenarios where there is a need to emphasize one aspect of classifier performance. For example, if greater precision is preferred over recall, the $\beta$ value in the $F_\beta$ evaluation metric can be adjusted accordingly, but the cross-entropy objective remains unaware of this preference during training. We propose a method that addresses this training-evaluation gap for multiclass neural network classifiers such that users can train these models informed by the desired final $F_\beta$-Score. Following prior work in binary classification, we utilize the concepts of the soft-set confusion matrices and a piecewise-linear approximation of the Heaviside step function. Our method extends the $2 \times 2$ binary soft-set confusion matrix to a multiclass $d \times d$ confusion matrix and proposes dynamic adaptation of the threshold value $\tau$, which parameterizes the piecewise-linear Heaviside approximation during run-time. We present a theoretical analysis that shows that our method can be used to optimize for a soft-set based approximation of Macro-$F_\beta$ that is a consistent estimator of Macro-$F_\beta$, and our extensive experiments show the practical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Introducing sgboost: A Practical Guide and Implementation of sparse-group boosting in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the sgboost package in R, which implements sparse-group boosting for modeling high-dimensional data with natural groupings in covariates. Sparse-group boosting offers a flexible approach for both group and individual variable selection, reducing overfitting and enhancing model interpretability. The package uses regularization techniques based on the degrees of freedom of individual and group base-learners, and is designed to be used in conjunction with the mboost package. Through comparisons with existing methods and demonstration of its unique functionalities, this paper provides a practical guide on utilizing sparse-group boosting in R, accompanied by code examples to facilitate its application in various research domains. Overall, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to use sparse-group boosting for efficient and interpretable high-dimensional data analysis.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Preference Optimization: Harnessing Implicit Q*-Approximation for Sample-Efficient RLHF</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a central tool for language model alignment. We consider online exploration in RLHF, which exploits interactive access to human or AI feedback by deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, maximally informative responses. By allowing RLHF to confidently stray from the pre-trained model, online exploration offers the possibility of novel, potentially super-human capabilities, but its full potential as a paradigm for language model training has yet to be realized, owing to computational and statistical bottlenecks in directly adapting existing reinforcement learning techniques. We propose a new algorithm for online exploration in RLHF, Exploratory Preference Optimization (XPO), which is simple and practical -- a one-line change to (online) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023) -- yet enjoys the strongest known provable guarantees and promising empirical performance. XPO augments the DPO objective with a novel and principled exploration bonus, empowering the algorithm to explore outside the support of the initial model and human feedback data. In theory, we show that XPO is provably sample-efficient and converges to a near-optimal language model policy under natural exploration conditions, irrespective of whether the initial model has good coverage. Our analysis, which builds on the observation that DPO implicitly performs a form of $Q^{\star}$-approximation (or, Bellman error minimization), combines previously disparate techniques from language modeling and theoretical reinforcement learning in a serendipitous fashion through the perspective of KL-regularized Markov decision processes. Empirically, we find that XPO is more sample-efficient than non-exploratory DPO variants in a preliminary evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the correlation structure of errors is essential for reliable uncertainty quantification in probabilistic time series forecasting. Recent deep learning models for multivariate time series have developed efficient parameterizations for time-varying contemporaneous covariance, but they often assume temporal independence of errors for simplicity. However, real-world data frequently exhibit significant error autocorrelation and cross-lag correlation due to factors such as missing covariates. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play method that learns the covariance structure of errors over multiple steps for autoregressive models with Gaussian-distributed errors. To achieve scalable inference and computational efficiency, we model the contemporaneous covariance using a low-rank-plus-diagonal parameterization and characterize cross-covariance through a group of independent latent temporal processes. The learned covariance matrix can be used to calibrate predictions based on observed residuals. We evaluate our method on probabilistic models built on RNN and Transformer architectures, and the results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification without significantly increasing the parameter size.</description>

Abstract: We consider the task of constructing confidence intervals with differential privacy. We propose two private variants of the non-parametric bootstrap, which privately compute the median of the results of multiple "little" bootstraps run on partitions of the data and give asymptotic bounds on the coverage error of the resulting confidence intervals. For a fixed differential privacy parameter $\epsilon$, our methods enjoy the same error rates as that of the non-private bootstrap to within logarithmic factors in the sample size $n$. We empirically validate the performance of our methods for mean estimation, median estimation, and logistic regression with both real and synthetic data. Our methods achieve similar coverage accuracy to existing methods (and non-private baselines) while providing notably shorter ($\gtrsim 10$ times) confidence intervals than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</description>

Abstract: State-space graphical models and the variational autoencoder framework provide a principled apparatus for learning dynamical systems from data. State-of-the-art probabilistic approaches are often able to scale to large problems at the cost of flexibility of the variational posterior or expressivity of the dynamics model. However, those consolidations can be detrimental if the ultimate goal is to learn a generative model capable of explaining the spatiotemporal structure of the data and making accurate forecasts. We introduce a low-rank structured variational autoencoding framework for nonlinear Gaussian state-space graphical models capable of capturing dense covariance structures that are important for learning dynamical systems with predictive capabilities. Our inference algorithm exploits the covariance structures that arise naturally from sample based approximate Gaussian message passing and low-rank amortized posterior updates -- effectively performing approximate variational smoothing with time complexity scaling linearly in the state dimensionality. In comparisons with other deep state-space model architectures our approach consistently demonstrates the ability to learn a more predictive generative model. Furthermore, when applied to neural physiological recordings, our approach is able to learn a dynamical system capable of forecasting population spiking and behavioral correlates from a small portion of single trials.</description>

Abstract: In conventional supervised learning, a training dataset is given with ground-truth labels from a known label set, and the learned model will classify unseen instances to known labels. This paper studies a new problem setting in which there are unknown classes in the training data misperceived as other labels, and thus their existence appears unknown from the given supervision. We attribute the unknown unknowns to the fact that the training dataset is badly advised by the incompletely perceived label space due to the insufficient feature information. To this end, we propose the exploratory machine learning, which examines and investigates training data by actively augmenting the feature space to discover potentially hidden classes. Our method consists of three ingredients including rejection model, feature exploration, and model cascade. We provide theoretical analysis to justify its superiority, and validate the effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding individual customers' sensitivities to prices, promotions, brands, and other marketing mix elements is fundamental to a wide swath of marketing problems. An important but understudied aspect of this problem is the dynamic nature of these sensitivities, which change over time and vary across individuals. Prior work has developed methods for capturing such dynamic heterogeneity within product categories, but neglected the possibility of correlated dynamics across categories. In this work, we introduce a framework to capture such correlated dynamics using a hierarchical dynamic factor model, where individual preference parameters are influenced by common cross-category dynamic latent factors, estimated through Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. We apply our model to grocery purchase data, and find that a surprising degree of dynamic heterogeneity can be accounted for by only a few global trends. We also characterize the patterns in how consumers' sensitivities evolve across categories. Managerially, the proposed framework not only enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging cross-category data, but enables more precise estimation of quantities of interest, like price elasticity.</description>

      <title>From CNNs to Shift-Invariant Twin Models Based on Complex Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to increase shift invariance and prediction accuracy in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we replace the first-layer combination "real-valued convolutions + max pooling" (RMax) by "complex-valued convolutions + modulus" (CMod), which is stable to translations, or shifts. To justify our approach, we claim that CMod and RMax produce comparable outputs when the convolution kernel is band-pass and oriented (Gabor-like filter). In this context, CMod can therefore be considered as a stable alternative to RMax. To enforce this property, we constrain the convolution kernels to adopt such a Gabor-like structure. The corresponding architecture is called mathematical twin, because it employs a well-defined mathematical operator to mimic the behavior of the original, freely-trained model. Our approach achieves superior accuracy on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 classification tasks, compared to prior methods based on low-pass filtering. Arguably, our approach's emphasis on retaining high-frequency details contributes to a better balance between shift invariance and information preservation, resulting in improved performance. Furthermore, it has a lower computational cost and memory footprint than concurrent work, making it a promising solution for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Traffic Forecasting Models with Dynamic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for traffic forecasting often assume the residual is independent and isotropic across time and space. This assumption simplifies loss functions such as mean absolute error, but real-world residual processes often exhibit significant autocorrelation and structured spatiotemporal correlation. This paper introduces a dynamic regression (DR) framework to enhance existing spatiotemporal traffic forecasting models by incorporating structured learning for the residual process. We assume the residual of the base model (i.e., a well-developed traffic forecasting model) follows a matrix-variate seasonal autoregressive (AR) model, which is seamlessly integrated into the training process through the redesign of the loss function. Importantly, the parameters of the DR framework are jointly optimized alongside the base model. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep traffic forecasting models using both speed and flow datasets, demonstrating improved performance and providing interpretable AR coefficients and spatiotemporal covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>On the universality of $S_n$-equivariant $k$-body gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The importance of symmetries has recently been recognized in quantum machine learning from the simple motto: if a task exhibits a symmetry (given by a group $\mathfrak{G}$), the learning model should respect said symmetry. This can be instantiated via $\mathfrak{G}$-equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), i.e., parametrized quantum circuits whose gates are generated by operators commuting with a given representation of $\mathfrak{G}$. In practice, however, there might be additional restrictions to the types of gates one can use, such as being able to act on at most $k$ qubits. In this work we study how the interplay between symmetry and $k$-bodyness in the QNN generators affect its expressiveness for the special case of $\mathfrak{G}=S_n$, the symmetric group. Our results show that if the QNN is generated by one- and two-body $S_n$-equivariant gates, the QNN is semi-universal but not universal. That is, the QNN can generate any arbitrary special unitary matrix in the invariant subspaces, but has no control over the relative phases between them. Then, we show that in order to reach universality one needs to include $n$-body generators (if $n$ is even) or $(n-1)$-body generators (if $n$ is odd). As such, our results brings us a step closer to better understanding the capabilities and limitations of equivariant QNNs.</description>

      <title>BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios like traffic and energy, massive time-series data with missing values and noises are widely observed, even sampled irregularly. While many imputation methods have been proposed, most of them work with a local horizon, which means models are trained by splitting the long sequence into batches of fit-sized patches. This local horizon can make models ignore global trends or periodic patterns. More importantly, almost all methods assume the observations are sampled at regular time stamps, and fail to handle complex irregular sampled time series arising from different applications. Thirdly, most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable for many applications with fast-arriving streaming data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional decomposition. We treat the multivariate time series as the weighted combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We apply a group of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with different kernels as functional priors to fit the factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method can not only handle imputation over arbitrary time stamps, but also offer uncertainty quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets.We release the code at {https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers two related learning problems in a federated attack prone setting: federated principal components analysis (PCA) and federated low rank column-wise sensing (LRCS). The node attacks are assumed to be Byzantine which means that the attackers are omniscient and can collude. We introduce a novel provably Byzantine-resilient communication-efficient and sampleefficient algorithm, called Subspace-Median, that solves the PCA problem and is a key part of the solution for the LRCS problem. We also study the most natural Byzantine-resilient solution for federated PCA, a geometric median based modification of the federated power method, and explain why it is not useful. Our second main contribution is a complete alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (altGDmin) algorithm for Byzantine-resilient horizontally federated LRCS and sample and communication complexity guarantees for it. Extensive simulation experiments are used to corroborate our theoretical guarantees. The ideas that we develop for LRCS are easily extendable to other LR recovery problems as well.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional robust regression under heavy-tailed data: Asymptotics and Universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-dimensional properties of robust regression estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates and response functions. In particular, we provide a sharp asymptotic characterisation of M-estimators trained on a family of elliptical covariate and noise data distributions including cases where second and higher moments do not exist. We show that, despite being consistent, the Huber loss with optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result also uncovers the existence of a transition in $\delta$ as a function of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal and universal for covariate distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist. Finally, we show that our formulas readily generalise to a richer family of models and data distributions, such as generalised linear estimation with arbitrary convex regularisation trained on mixture models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in estimating heterogeneous causal effects. In this paper, we study conditional average partial causal effects (CAPCE) to reveal the heterogeneity of causal effects with continuous treatment. We provide conditions for identifying CAPCE in an instrumental variable setting. Notably, CAPCE is identifiable under a weaker assumption than required by a commonly used measure for estimating heterogeneous causal effects of continuous treatment. We develop three families of CAPCE estimators: sieve, parametric, and reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based, and analyze their statistical properties. We illustrate the proposed CAPCE estimators on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Gradient Method for Convex Smooth Simple Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on simple bilevel optimization problems, where we minimize a convex smooth objective function over the optimal solution set of another convex smooth constrained optimization problem. We present a novel bilevel optimization method that locally approximates the solution set of the lower-level problem using a cutting plane approach and employs an accelerated gradient-based update to reduce the upper-level objective function over the approximated solution set. We measure the performance of our method in terms of suboptimality and infeasibility errors and provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for both error criteria. Specifically, when the feasible set is compact, we show that our method requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\max\{1/\sqrt{\epsilon_{f}}, 1/\epsilon_g\})$ iterations to find a solution that is $\epsilon_f$-suboptimal and $\epsilon_g$-infeasible. Moreover, under the additional assumption that the lower-level objective satisfies the $r$-th H\"olderian error bound, we show that our method achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\max\{\epsilon_{f}^{-\frac{2r-1}{2r}},\epsilon_{g}^{-\frac{2r-1}{2r}}\})$, which matches the optimal complexity of single-level convex constrained optimization when $r=1$.</description>

      <title>Cross-Temporal Forecast Reconciliation at Digital Platforms with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platform businesses operate on a digital core and their decision making requires high-dimensional accurate forecast streams at different levels of cross-sectional (e.g., geographical regions) and temporal aggregation (e.g., minutes to days). It also necessitates coherent forecasts across all levels of the hierarchy to ensure aligned decision making across different planning units such as pricing, product, controlling and strategy. Given that platform data streams feature complex characteristics and interdependencies, we introduce a non-linear hierarchical forecast reconciliation method that produces cross-temporal reconciled forecasts in a direct and automated way through the use of popular machine learning methods. The method is sufficiently fast to allow forecast-based high-frequency decision making that platforms require. We empirically test our framework on unique, large-scale streaming datasets from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe and a bicycle sharing system in New York City.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Convergence of Discrete-time Diffusion Models: New Approach and Improved Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique that converts noise into data. While there are many studies providing theoretical guarantees for diffusion processes based on discretized stochastic differential equation (D-SDE), many generative samplers in real applications directly employ a discrete-time (DT) diffusion process. However, there are very few studies analyzing these DT processes, e.g., convergence for DT diffusion processes has been obtained only for distributions with bounded support. In this paper, we establish the convergence guarantee for substantially larger classes of distributions under DT diffusion processes and further improve the convergence rate for distributions with bounded support. In particular, we first establish the convergence rates for both smooth and general (possibly non-smooth) distributions having a finite second moment. We then specialize our results to a number of interesting classes of distributions with explicit parameter dependencies, including distributions with Lipschitz scores, Gaussian mixture distributions, and any distributions with early-stopping. We further propose a novel accelerated sampler and show that it improves the convergence rates of the corresponding regular sampler by orders of magnitude with respect to all system parameters. Our study features a novel analytical technique that constructs a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and exploits Tweedie's formula for handling Taylor expansion power terms.</description>

      <title>The Power of Few: Accelerating and Enhancing Data Reweighting with Coreset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning tasks continue to evolve, the trend has been to gather larger datasets and train increasingly larger models. While this has led to advancements in accuracy, it has also escalated computational costs to unsustainable levels. Addressing this, our work aims to strike a delicate balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy, a persisting challenge in the field. We introduce a novel method that employs core subset selection for reweighting, effectively optimizing both computational time and model performance. By focusing on a strategically selected coreset, our approach offers a robust representation, as it efficiently minimizes the influence of outliers. The re-calibrated weights are then mapped back to and propagated across the entire dataset. Our experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of this approach, underscoring its potential as a scalable and precise solution for model training.</description>

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference trains neural networks to solve stochastic inference problems using model simulations, thereby making it possible to rapidly perform Bayesian inference for any newly observed data. However, current simulation-based amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method -- the Simformer -- which overcomes these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood. We showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.</description>

      <title>The Road Less Scheduled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free).</description>

      <title>Robust Entropy Search for Safe Efficient Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The practical use of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in engineering applications imposes special requirements: high sampling efficiency on the one hand and finding a robust solution on the other hand. We address the case of adversarial robustness, where all parameters are controllable during the optimization process, but a subset of them is uncontrollable or even adversely perturbed at the time of application. To this end, we develop an efficient information-based acquisition function that we call Robust Entropy Search (RES). We empirically demonstrate its benefits in experiments on synthetic and real-life data. The results showthat RES reliably finds robust optima, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Point Process Learning and its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cronie et al. (2024) introduced the notion of cross-validation for point processes and a new statistical methodology called Point Process Learning (PPL). In PPL one splits a point process/pattern into a training and a validation set, and then predicts the latter from the former through a parametrised Papangelou conditional intensity. The model parameters are estimated by minimizing a point process prediction error; this notion was introduced as the second building block of PPL. It was shown that PPL outperforms the state-of-the-art in both kernel intensity estimation and estimation of the parameters of the Gibbs hard-core process. In the latter case, the state-of-the-art was represented by pseudolikelihood estimation. In this paper we study PPL in relation to Takacs-Fiksel estimation, of which pseudolikelihood is a special case. We show that Takacs-Fiksel estimation is a special case of PPL in the sense that PPL with a specific loss function asymptotically reduces to Takacs-Fiksel estimation if we let the cross-validation regime tend to leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, PPL involves a certain type of hyperparameter given by a weight function which ensures that the prediction errors have expectation zero if and only if we have the correct parametrisation. We show that the weight function takes an explicit but intractable form for general Gibbs models. Consequently, we propose different approaches to estimate the weight function in practice. In order to assess how the general PPL setup performs in relation to its special case Takacs-Fiksel estimation, we conduct a simulation study where we find that for common Gibbs models we can find loss functions and hyperparameters so that PPL typically outperforms Takacs-Fiksel estimation significantly in terms of mean square error. Here, the hyperparameters are the cross-validation parameters and the weight function estimate.</description>
