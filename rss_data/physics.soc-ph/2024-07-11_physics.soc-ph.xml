      <title>Analysis of Seawater Quality Parameter and Treatment with Hydrodynamic Cavitation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the research was to compare the quality parameters of Seawater before and after hydrodynamic cavitation treatment. The Hydrodynamic Cavitation Method for water treatment gives the highest reduction in Turbidity (100%), the second highest reduction in TSS (83.86%), and the lowest reduction in Na+ (8.47%), according to the study and analysis of various quality parameters. When compared to CPCB Water Quality Criteria, treated water is suitable for outdoor bathing; it again satisfies the standards for classes SW-I, SW-II, SW-III, SW-IV and SW-V, i.e., treated sea water can be used for a variety of purposes, including bathing, contact water sports, commercial fishing, mariculture, ecologically sensitive zones, aesthetics, harbour, waters Navigation and Controlled water disposal. The SAR value of treated water, which is 1.72, indicates it is appropriate for all types of soil and crops. The treated water's WQI, which is 65, showed that it is of Fair quality and may be used for industrial and irrigation uses. Water quality can be improved by recycling the treated water for an additional 24 hours using the hydrodynamic cavitation method. Recycling of one time treated sea water will result in higher-quality water that can be used for a variety of purposes.
  The Hydrodynamic Cavitation method by using venturi - orifice is proven to be the most effective over the other methods. Because it does not require any chemical reagent, hence does not produce any hazardous chemical waste, and maintains an eco-friendly and economically sustainable, environment benign technique for the treatment of Seawater.</description>

      <title>Optimal bias of utility function between two-layer network for the evolution of prosocial behavior in two-order game and higher-order game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is an important research object in economics, sociology, and biology, and the evolution of cooperation in structured populations is a interesting research topic. We mainly focus on the evolution of cooperation with two-order and higher-order game in two-layer network. We introduce a bias coefficient of utility function and study the influence of bias coefficient on the evolution of cooperation in two-layer network. We firstly provide theoretical analysis of fixation probabilities of two-order and higher-order game under weak selection in two-layer network.Secondly,based on the expression of fixation probability, we obtain the critical value of the two different games by comparing the size relationship of fixation probability under weak selection condition and neutral selection condition. Finally, by comparing the relationship between the critical value of single-layer and two-layer network in two-order game and higher-order game, when the nonlinear factor satisfies certain conditions, it is concluded that when the optimal bias coefficient tends towards 0 is met, some two-layer networks promote the evolution of cooperative behavior more than some single-layer networks.</description>

      <title>A non-conservative kinetic framework for a closed-market society subject to shock events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several events have shockingly impacted society, carrying tough consequences. This was evident in the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, not all individuals are affected by shock events in the same way. Among other factors, the consequences can vary depending on the wealth class. In our presented work, the approach typical of kinetic theory is used to analyze the dynamics of a closed-market society exposed to various types of shock events. To achieve this, we introduce non-conservative equations, incorporating proliferative and destructive binary interactions as well as external actions. Specifically, the latter term reproduces the shock events, and to accomplish this, we introduce an appropriate external force field into the kinetic framework, modeled using Gaussian functions. Several numerical simulations exploring different scenarios are presented to illustrate the behavior of the solution predicted by the model and to gain some insights when complex situations are investigated.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Fuzzy Membership in Motif Modularity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order community detection (HCD) reveals both mesoscale structures and functional characteristics of real-life networks. Although many methods have been developed from diverse perspectives, to our knowledge, none can provide fine-grained higher-order fuzzy community information. This study presents a novel concept of higher-order fuzzy memberships that quantify the membership grades of motifs to crisp higher-order communities, thereby revealing the partial community affiliations. Furthermore, we employ higher-order fuzzy memberships to enhance HCD via a general framework called fuzzy memberships assisted motif-based evolutionary modularity (FMMEM). In FFMEM, on the one hand, a fuzzy membership-based neighbor community modification (FM-NCM) strategy is designed to correct misassigned bridge nodes, thereby improving partition quality. On the other hand, a fuzzy membership-based local community merging (FM-LCM) strategy is also proposed to combine excessively fragmented communities for enhancing local search ability. Experimental results indicate that the FMMEM framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets, particularly in the networks with ambiguous and complex structures.</description>

      <title>Support and Scandals in GameFi dApps: A Network Analysis of The Sandbox Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the burgeoning field of GameFi through a detailed network analysis of The Sandbox, a prominent decentralized application (dApp) in this domain. Utilizing the bow-tie model, we map out transaction data within The Sandbox, providing a novel perspective on its operational dynamics. Our study investigates the varying impacts of external support, uncovering a surprising absence of enduring effects on network activity. We also investigate the network's response to several notable incidents, including the Ronin Hack and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's hearing on cryptocurrencies, revealing a generally resilient structure with limited long-term disturbances. A critical aspect of our analysis focuses on the "whales," or major stakeholders in The Sandbox, where we uncover their pivotal role in influencing network trends, noting a significant shift in their engagement over time. This research sheds light on the intricate workings of GameFi ecosystems and contributes to the broader discourse on the intersection of the Web, AI, and society, particularly in understanding the resilience and dynamics of emerging digital economies. We particularly note the parallels of the long-tail behavior we see in web-based ecosystems appearing in this niche domain of GameFi. Our findings hold significant implications for the future development of equitable and sustainable GameFi dApps, offering insights into stakeholder behavior and network resilience in the face of external challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Interbank network reconstruction enforcing density and reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of financial exposures are the key propagators of risk and distress among banks, but their empirical structure is not publicly available because of confidentiality. This limitation has triggered the development of methods of network reconstruction from partial, aggregate information. Unfortunately, even the best methods available fail in replicating the number of directed cycles, which on the other hand play a crucial role in determining graph spectra and hence the degree of network stability and systemic risk. Here we address this challenge by exploiting the hypothesis that the statistics of higher-order cycles is strongly constrained by that of the shortest ones, i.e. by the amount of dyads with reciprocated links. First, we provide a detailed analysis of link reciprocity on the e-MID dataset of Italian banks, finding that correlations between reciprocal links systematically increase with the temporal resolution, typically changing from negative to positive around a timescale of up to 50 days. Then, we propose a new network reconstruction method capable of enforcing, only from the knowledge of aggregate interbank assets and liabilities, both a desired sparsity and a desired link reciprocity. We confirm that the addition of reciprocity dramatically improves the prediction of several structural and spectral network properties, including the largest real eigenvalue and the eccentricity of the elliptical distribution of the other eigenvalues in the complex plane. These results illustrate the importance of correctly addressing the temporal resolution and the resulting level of reciprocity in the reconstruction of financial networks.</description>
