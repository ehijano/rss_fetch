      <title>DCE-Qnet: Deep Network Quantification of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Quantification of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI has the potential to provide valuable clinical information, but robust pharmacokinetic modeling remains a challenge for clinical adoption.
  Methods: A 7-layer neural network called DCE-Qnet was trained on simulated DCE-MRI signals derived from the Extended Tofts model with the Parker arterial input function. Network training incorporated B1 inhomogeneities to estimate perfusion (Ktrans, vp, ve), tissue T1 relaxation, proton density and bolus arrival time (BAT). The accuracy was tested in a digital phantom in comparison to a conventional nonlinear least-squares fitting (NLSQ). In vivo testing was conducted in 10 healthy subjects. Regions of interest in the cervix and uterine myometrium were used to calculate the inter-subject variability. The clinical utility was demonstrated on a cervical cancer patient. Test-retest experiments were used to assess reproducibility of the parameter maps in the tumor.
  Results: The DCE-Qnet reconstruction outperformed NLSQ in the phantom. The coefficient of variation (CV) in the healthy cervix varied between 5-51% depending on the parameter. Parameter values in the tumor agreed with previous studies despite differences in methodology. The CV in the tumor varied between 1-47%.
  Conclusion: The proposed approach provides comprehensive DCE-MRI quantification from a single acquisition. DCE-Qnet eliminates the need for separate T1 scan or BAT processing, leading to a reduction of 10 minutes per scan and more accurate quantification.</description>

      <title>A novel forward-looking ultrasound catheter for treating vascular occlusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thrombotic and chronic occlusions of large blood vessels are a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and so there is a need for improved treatments in many clinical circumstances. Endovascular ultrasound approaches have been shown to hold considerable potential to treat large vessel thrombotic occlusions. Here, we report the development of a novel forward-looking therapeutic ultrasound catheter approach. The design concept centers on the use of a radially polarized hollow cylindrical transducer situated at the distal tip. This approach enables a compact configuration where the central lumen can accommodate a guidewire during navigation as well as provide a route to release cavitation seeds and therapeutic agents adjacent to the site of occlusion. PZT-5H transducers with outer/inner diameters of 1.35/0.73 mm were evaluated using simulations and experiments for their capacity to project forward-looking ultrasound. A length of 2.5 mm operating in the 3rd harmonic of the length mode resonance (1.85 MHz) was selected. Catheters (1.55 mm outer diameter) were designed and fabricated with a liner, outer jacket, and braiding, where the transducers were incorporated with air-backing and a front-face matching layer. Forward-looking pressures of 2.5 MPa (peak negative) at 0.5 mm were achieved. Proof of principle vessel phantom experiments were performed demonstrating the ability to eject microbubbles in proximity to an occlusion and stimulate inertial cavitation. This approach holds potential for treating thrombotic and chronic total occlusions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inspired Approach for Medical Imaging: Applications to Background Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background noise in medical imaging poses significant challenges for accurate diagnosis, prompting the development of denoising algorithms. Traditional methodologies, however, often struggle to address the complexities of noisy environments in high dimensional imaging systems. This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired approach for denoising medical images, drawing upon principles of quantum and condensed matter physics. Our approach views medical images as amorphous structures akin to those found in condensed matter physics and we propose an algorithm that incorporates the concept of mode resolved localization directly into the denoising process, resulting in compression of imaging modes by over 70 percent. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning. The proposed method is a standalone algorithm with minimal manual intervention, demonstrating its potential to achieve quantum-level performance without heavy reliance on classical algorithms. Through experimental validation, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise- related challenges in medical imaging, underscoring its relevance for current and future quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies achieved using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, we develop novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive local boundary conditions to improve Deformable Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: In medical imaging, it is often crucial to accurately assess and correct movement during image-guided therapy. Deformable image registration (DIR) consists in estimating the required spatial transformation to align a moving image with a fixed one. However, it is acknowledged that, boundary conditions applied to the solution are critical in preventing mis-registration. Despite the extensive research on registration techniques, relatively few have addressed the issue of boundary conditions in the context of medical DIR. Our aim is a step towards customizing boundary conditions to suit the diverse registration tasks at hand.
  Approach: We propose a generic, locally adaptive, Robin-type condition enabling to balance between Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, depending on incoming/outgoing flow fields on the image boundaries. The proposed framework is entirely automatized through the determination of a reduced set of hyperparameters optimized via energy minimization.
  Main results: The proposed approach was tested on a mono-modal CT thorax registration task and an abdominal CT to MRI registration task. For the first task, we observed a relative improvement in terms of target registration error of up to 12% (mean 4%), compared to homogeneous Dirichlet and homogeneous Neumann. For the second task, the automatic framework provides results closed to the best achievable.
  Significance: This study underscores the importance of tailoring the registration problem at the image boundaries. In this research, we introduce a novel method to adapt the boundary conditions on a voxel-by-voxel basis, yielding optimized results in two distinct tasks: mono-modal CT thorax registration and abdominal CT to MRI registration. The proposed framework enables optimized boundary conditions in image registration without any a priori assumptions regarding the images or the motion.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Modal Optimal Transport for Fast Cross-Modal MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in comprehensive disease diagnosis in clinical medicine. However, acquiring certain modalities, such as T2-weighted images (T2WIs), is time-consuming and prone to be with motion artifacts. It negatively impacts subsequent multi-modal image analysis. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that utilizes T1-weighted images (T1WIs) as auxiliary modalities to expedite T2WIs' acquisitions. While image pre-processing is capable of mitigating misalignment, improper parameter selection leads to adverse pre-processing effects, requiring iterative experimentation and adjustment. To overcome this shortage, we employ Optimal Transport (OT) to synthesize T2WIs by aligning T1WIs and performing cross-modal synthesis, effectively mitigating spatial misalignment effects. Furthermore, we adopt an alternating iteration framework between the reconstruction task and the cross-modal synthesis task to optimize the final results. Then, we prove that the reconstructed T2WIs and the synthetic T2WIs become closer on the T2 image manifold with iterations increasing, and further illustrate that the improved reconstruction result enhances the synthesis process, whereas the enhanced synthesis result improves the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results from FastMRI and internal datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in image reconstruction quality even at low sampling rates.</description>
