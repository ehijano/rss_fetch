      <title>Multi-Frequency Coherence Control of Radio-Frequency-Dressed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate engineering of a narrow microwave transition between trappable states in radio-frequency-dressed $^{87}$rubidium, reducing the static field dependence. A single-frequency, off-resonant microwave field allows for the suppression of the differential Zeeman shift arising from the nuclear magnetic moment to at least first order. The field dependence can be suppressed further with additional dressing fields, which we demonstrate experimentally with two microwave frequencies. The engineered transition can thus be used in a range of cold atom schemes that rely on coherent state superpositions.</description>

      <title>Multipole nuclear shielding factors of hydrogen atom confined by a spherical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear shielding factor is an important quantity to describe the response of an atom under the perturbation of an external field. In this work, we develop the sum-over-states numerical method and the Hylleraas variational perturbation approximation to calculate the multipole nuclear shielding factors for general one-electron systems and apply them to the model of the hydrogen atom confined by a spherical cavity. The generalized pseudospectral method is employed to solve the eigenstates of the unperturbed atom. The obtained dipole nuclear shielding factors are in good agreement with previous calculations and the higher-pole results are reported for the first time. The asymptotic behaviors of the multipole nuclear shielding factors in both the large- and small-confinement limits are analyzed with the assistance of variational perturbation theory. The free-atom values can be exactly reproduced by the second-order perturbation approximation and all multipole nuclear shielding factors in the small-confinement limit tend to zero by a linear law. The variational perturbation method manifests exponential convergence with increasing the order of approximation. The numerical and approximate methods developed in this work together pave the way for further investigation of the multipole nuclear shielding factors for general atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Generating isolated elliptically polarized attosecond pulse in gapped graphene using linearly polarized laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the two-band density-matrix equations to calculate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and its ellipticity in gapped graphene irradiated by a femtosecond short-pulse laser under different orientation angles. The orientation-dependent harmonic spectra show obvious enhancement harmonics. We also focus on the ellipticity of these enhanced harmonics. Utilizing the recombination trajectory model, the enhanced harmonics are attributed to the caustic effect, whose orientation dependence originates from the inequivalence of $\textrm{K}$ points during the electron ionization process for different orientation angles. In addition, the harmonic ellipticity can be well understood by the phase difference of saddle-point currents. Based on our theory, we design a two-color field scheme to generate elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in gapped graphene. This work may shed light on the generation of elliptically polarized attosecond pulses in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Laughlin-like states of few atomic excitations in small subwavelength atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems focuses on the single-excitation regime. In one relevant example, the combination of multiple excited states and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, albeit with dispersion relations that can exhibit divergences near the light cone. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</description>

      <title>Mach-Zehnder atom interferometry with non-interacting trapped Bose Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherent manipulation of a quantum wave is at the core of quantum sensing. For instance, atom interferometers require linear splitting and recombination processes to map the accumulated phase shift into a measurable population signal. Although Bose Einstein condensates (BECs) are the archetype of coherent matter waves, their manipulation between trapped spatial modes has been limited by the strong interparticle collisions. Here, we overcome this problem by using BECs with tunable interaction trapped in an innovative array of double-well potentials and exploiting quantum tunneling to realize linear beam splitting. We operate several Mach-Zehnder interferometers in parallel, canceling common-mode potential instabilities by a differential analysis, thus demonstrating a trapped-atom gradiometer. Furthermore, by applying a spin-echo protocol, we suppress additional decoherence sources and approach unprecedented coherence times of one second. Our interferometer will find applications in precision measurements of forces with a high spatial resolution and in linear manipulation of quantum entangled states for sensing with sub shot-noise sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Bandstructure of a coupled BEC-cavity system: effects of dissipation and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a transversally driven Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity. We focus on the interplay between different coherent couplings, which can trigger a structural phase transition, known as the superradiant phase transition. Our approach, based on band structure theory and a mean-field description, enables a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the system's excited modes, precursing the phase transitions. By incorporating dissipative couplings, intrinsic to these systems, we find non-Hermitian phenomena such as the coalescence of crossing precursor modes and the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). The general formulation of our model allows us to explain the role of an angle between transverse pump and the cavity deviating from $90^\circ$. This offers us a unified perspective on the plethora of different implementations of such systems.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Quasi-Particle Excitations in a Quantum Gas with Cavity-Mediated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative quantum systems can undergo transitions from stationary to dynamical phases, reflecting the emergence of collective non-equilibrium behavior. We study such a transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate coupled to an optical cavity and develop a cavity-assisted Bragg spectroscopy technique to resolve its collective modes. We observe dissipation-induced synchronization at the quasiparticle level, where two roton-like modes coalesce at an exceptional point. This reveals how dissipation microscopically drives collective dynamics and signals a precursor to a dynamical phase transition.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>

      <title>Time delay of mean field interaction in thermal Rydberg atomic gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field theory is commonly employed to study nonequilibrium dynamics in hot Rydberg atomic ensembles, but the fundamental mechanism behind the generation of the mean-field interactions remains poorly understood. In this work, we experimentally observe a time-delay effect in the buildup of mean-field interaction, which reveals the key role of collision ionization. We analyze the relevant collision channels and propose a microscopic mechanism that quantitatively explains the hysteresis window observed in optical bistability. Then, using square-wave modulation spectroscopy (SMS) to monitor the growth of the mean-field interaction, we experimentally demonstrate a delay in its dynamical buildup following the initial Rydberg excitation. Finally, we demonstrate how this delay effect may help understand the recently observed self-sustained oscillations in thermal Rydberg gases. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the contribution of ionization processes in the nonequilibrium dynamics of thermal Rydberg gas, a system of growing interest for quantum sensing and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of strong coupling Bose polarons: From repulsive polarons to non-Gaussian many-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00835v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the Bose polaron problem of a mobile impurity interacting strongly with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing) impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states, including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state. This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques. This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons on the repulsive side of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Supersolid Order via Vortex Trajectory Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental exploration of supersolid regimes in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs that is applicable to large system sizes. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity even in the presence of dissipation. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions as experimental system sizes are increased.</description>
