      <title>mRNA Folding Algorithms for Structure and Codon Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mRNA technology has revolutionized vaccine development, protein replacement therapies, and cancer immunotherapies, offering rapid production and precise control over sequence and efficacy. However, the inherent instability of mRNA poses significant challenges for drug storage and distribution, particularly in resource-limited regions. Co-optimizing RNA structure and codon choice has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance mRNA stability while preserving efficacy. Given the vast sequence and structure design space, specialized algorithms are essential to achieve these qualities. Recently, several effective algorithms have been developed to tackle this challenge that all use similar underlying principles. We call these specialized algorithms "mRNA folding" algorithms as they generalize classical RNA folding algorithms. A comprehensive analysis of their underlying principles, performance, and limitations is lacking. This review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of these algorithms, identify opportunities for improvement, and benchmark existing software implementations in terms of scalability, correctness, and feature support.</description>

      <title>IgCraft: A versatile sequence generation framework for antibody discovery and engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing antibody sequences to better resemble those observed in natural human repertoires is a key challenge in biologics development. We introduce IgCraft: a multi-purpose model for paired human antibody sequence generation, built on Bayesian Flow Networks. IgCraft presents one of the first unified generative modeling frameworks capable of addressing multiple antibody sequence design tasks with a single model, including unconditional sampling, sequence inpainting, inverse folding, and CDR motif scaffolding. Our approach achieves competitive results across the full spectrum of these tasks while constraining generation to the space of human antibody sequences, exhibiting particular strengths in CDR motif scaffolding (grafting) where we achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of humanness and preservation of structural properties. By integrating previously separate tasks into a single scalable generative model, IgCraft provides a versatile platform for sampling human antibody sequences under a variety of contexts relevant to antibody discovery and engineering. Model code and weights are publicly available at github.com/mgreenig/IgCraft.</description>

      <title>Chem42: a Family of chemical Language Models for Target-aware Ligand Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Revolutionizing drug discovery demands more than just understanding molecular interactions - it requires generative models that can design novel ligands tailored to specific biological targets. While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</description>

      <title>Clustering data by reordering them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grouping elements into families to analyse them separately is a standard analysis procedure in many areas of sciences. We propose herein a new algorithm based on the simple idea that members from a family look like each other, and don't resemble elements foreign to the family. After reordering the data according to the distance between elements, the analysis is automatically performed with easily-understandable parameters. Noise is explicitly taken into account to deal with the variety of problems of a data-driven world. We applied the algorithm to sort biomolecules conformations, gene sequences, cells, images, and experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>UniMoMo: Unified Generative Modeling of 3D Molecules for De Novo Binder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of target-specific molecules such as small molecules, peptides, and antibodies is vital for biological research and drug discovery. Existing generative methods are restricted to single-domain molecules, failing to address versatile therapeutic needs or utilize cross-domain transferability to enhance model performance. In this paper, we introduce Unified generative Modeling of 3D Molecules (UniMoMo), the first framework capable of designing binders of multiple molecular domains using a single model. In particular, UniMoMo unifies the representations of different molecules as graphs of blocks, where each block corresponds to either a standard amino acid or a molecular fragment. Based on these unified representations, UniMoMo utilizes a geometric latent diffusion model for 3D molecular generation, featuring an iterative full-atom autoencoder to compress blocks into latent space points, followed by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion process. Extensive benchmarks across peptides, antibodies, and small molecules demonstrate the superiority of our unified framework over existing domain-specific models, highlighting the benefits of multi-domain training.</description>
