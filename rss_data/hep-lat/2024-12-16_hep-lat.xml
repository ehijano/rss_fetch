      <title>Towards the phase diagram of fermions coupled with $SO(3)$ quantum links in $(2+1)$-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum link models (QLMs) are generalizations of Wilson's lattice gauge theory formulated with finite-dimensional link Hilbert spaces. In certain cases, the non-Abelian Gauss Law constraint can be exactly solved, and the gauge invariant subspace embedded onto local spin Hamiltonians for efficient quantum simulation. In $(1+1)d$ previous studies of the $SO(3)$ QLM coupled to adjoint fermionic matter have been shown to reflect key properties of QCD and nuclear physics, including distinct confining/deconfining phases and hadronic bound states. We extend the model to $(2+1)d$ dimensions for the first time, and report on our initial results. We review the construction of gauge-invariant state space for the proposed models, and study the single-plaquette ground state via exact-diagonalisation. We provide indications of a rich phase diagram which shows both spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and distinct magnetic phases characterised by different plaquette expectation values.</description>

      <title>The determination of potential scales in 2+1 flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the hadronic scales $r_0$, $r_1$ and their ratio $r_0/r_1$ on $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ flavor QCD ensembles generated by the CLS consortium. These scales are determined from a tree-level improved definition of the static force on the lattice, which we measure using Wilson loops. Our analysis involves various continuum and chiral extrapolations of data that cover pion masses between 134 MeV and 420 MeV and five lattice spacings down to 0.039 fm. We compare the potential scales to gradient flow scales by forming corresponding ratios. We find $r_0=0.4757(64)$ fm at the physical point. As a byproduct of our analysis we express the $N_{\rm f}=3$ QCD Lambda parameter determined by the ALPHA Collaboration in units of the scale $r_0$ and obtain $r_0 \Lambda^{(3)}_{\overline{\rm{MS}}} = 0.820(28)$. Furthermore we present results for the second derivative of the potential to study its shape and compare it to phenomenological potential models.</description>

      <title>Investigating SU(3) with Nf=8 fundamental fermions at strong renormalized coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice simulations have observed a novel strong coupling symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase for the SU(3) gauge system with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions (represented by two sets of staggered fields) at very large renormalized coupling ($g^2_{GF} \gtrsim 25$). The results of Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 014513 suggest that the SMG phase is separated from the weak coupling, conformal phase by a continuous phase transition, implying that the SMG phase exists in the continuum limit. To scrutinize these findings, we are generating a set of large volume zero temperature ensembles using nHYP improved staggered fermions with additional Pauli-Villars fields to tame gauge field fluctuations. We consider the low-lying meson spectrum and verify the existence of the SMG phase. Based on a finite size scaling analysis we predict that the phase transition between the strong and weak coupling phases is likely governed by a merged fixed point that is ultraviolet in the strong coupling but infrared in the weak coupling side. This finding suggests that the SU(3) 8-flavor system sits at the opening of the conformal window</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of Asymmetry Generation in Fermion-Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform real-time simulation of fermion-bubble scattering during a first order phase transition by which the fermions become massive. This out-of-equilibrium dynamics can generate a CP asymmetry, which is a crucial ingredient for baryon asymmetry generation in the early Universe. As a prototype, we consider a 1+1-dimensional system, for which CP is replaced by charge conjugation C. We use tensor network methods to study the C asymmetry generation outside the bubble wall induced by a complex fermion mass profile. In the asymptotic region, where reflected particles are far from the scattering point, our lattice calculations are in good agreement with perturbative calculations, but are also applicable in the nonpertubative regime. Real-time evolution of the instantaneous asymmetry generation near the collision point is also accessible within our framework and can be an order of magnitude larger than the asymptotic value. This intriguing feature may have far-reaching consequences in a full model calculation of electroweak baryogenesis. Our studies provide a necessary step for guiding quantum simulations of early universe phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quark Density in Lattice QC$_2$D at Imaginary and Real Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lattice two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) with two flavors of staggered fermions at imaginary and real quark chemical potential $\mu_q$ and $T&gt;T_c$. We employ various methods of extrapolation of the quark number density from imaginary to real quark chemical potentials $\mu_q$, including series expansions as well as analytic continuation based on phenomenological models, and study their accuracy by comparing the results to the lattice data. Below the Roberge-Weiss temperature, $T&lt;T_{RW}$, we find that the cluster expansion model provides an accurate analytic continuation of the baryon number density in the studied range of chemical potentials. On the other hand, the behavior of the reconstructed canonical partition functions indicates that the available models may require corrections at high quark densities. At $T&gt;T_{RW}$ we show that the analytic continuation to the real values of $\mu_q$ based on trigonometric functions works equally well with the conventional method based on the Taylor expansion in powers of $\mu_q$.</description>

      <title>Numerical fractional instantons in SU(2): center vortices, monopoles, and a sharp transition between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a numerical cooling algorithm to study fractional instantons in $SU(2)$ pure Yang-Mills on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$, $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$. We confirm that the fractional instantons are center vortices on $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{T}^2_*$ and monopoles on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and we calculate several properties relevant to using these solutions for semiclassical calculations. On $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^2_* \times S^1$, we interpolate between the large $\mathbb{T}^2_*$ limit and the large $S^1$ limit to study how the solutions interpolate between center vortices and monopoles. We find that they are separated by a sharp transition, with 't Hooft's constant field strength solutions living at the transition point. These results contrast but do not contradict recent results suggesting continuity between vortices and monopoles.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Axion QED as a Lattice Gauge Theory and Non-Invertible Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-invertible symmetry associated with chiral symmetry in axion quantum electrodynamics (QED) using the modified Villain formulation. In axion QED, it is known that naive magnetic objects such as 't Hooft loops and axion strings lose their gauge invariance due to the violation of the Bianchi identity for the field strength of the photon or "field strength" of the axion. First, we construct the action of axion QED on the square lattice, which is more intricate than its counterpart in the continuum theory. We then observe the breaking of gauge invariance. Subsequently, we construct gauge-invariant magnetic objects by introducing new degrees of freedom localized at the positions of the magnetic objects. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the response of the magnetic objects under the action of the non-invertible symmetry operator constructed in Ref. [1]. In this analysis, we employ a method different from the so-called half-space gauging, which is the standard method to study non-invertible symmetries.</description>
