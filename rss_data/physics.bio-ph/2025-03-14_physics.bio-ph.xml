      <title>In-vitro measurements coupled with in-silico simulations for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials</title>

Abstract: In the standard Bayesian framework, a likelihood function is required, which can be difficult or computationally expensive to derive for non homogeneous biological materials under complex mechanical loading conditions. Here, we propose a simple and practical approach based on in vitro measurements and in silico simulations using the likelihood free Bayesian inference with the finite element method simultaneously for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials. We implement this approach for distal, middle, and proximal human Achilles tendon specimens obtained from diabetic patients post amputation. A wide range of in vitro loading conditions are considered, including one step and two step relaxation, as well as incremental cyclic loading tests. In silico simulations are performed for the tendons assuming a fiber reinforced viscoelastic response, which is modeled separately for the ground matrix and fiber components. Initially, the calibration of the specimen specific parameters is predicted using Bayesian optimization and the sensitivity of each parameter is evaluated using the Sobol index and random forest. Then, the bounds of the parameters are used as priors, coupled with in vitro data in simulation based approximate Bayesian computations to calibrate and quantify the uncertainty of parameters. The results demonstrate that increasing the number of loading scenarios improves the accuracy of the best fit parameter set. Furthermore, approximate Bayesian inference shows that in silico simulations using the posterior parameters, can capture the uncertainty bounds of in vitro measurements. This approach provides a useful framework for stochastic calibration of constitutive material model parameters without the need to derive a likelihood function, regardless of the specimens geometry or loading conditions.</description>

      <title>The Role of Sequence Information in Minimal Models of Molecular Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequence-directed assembly processes - such as protein folding - allow the assembly of a large number of structures with high accuracy from only a small handful of fundamental building blocks. We aim to explore how efficiently sequence information can be used to direct assembly by studying variants of the temperature-1 abstract tile assembly model (aTAM). We ask whether, for each variant, their exists a finite set of tile types that can deterministically assemble any shape producible by a given assembly model; we call such tile type sets "universal assembly kits". Our first model, which we call the "backboned aTAM", generates backbone-assisted assembly by forcing tiles to be added to lattice positions neighbouring the immediately preceding tile, using a predetermined sequence of tile types. We demonstrate the existence of universal assembly kit for the backboned aTAM, and show that the existence of this set is maintained even under stringent restrictions to the rules of assembly. We compare these results to a less constrained model that we call sequenced aTAM, which also uses a predetermined sequence of tiles, but does not constrain a tile to neighbour the immediately preceding tiles. We prove that this model has no universal assembly kit in the stringent case. The lack of such a kit is surprising, given that the number of tile sequences of length N scales faster than both the number and worst-case Kolmogorov complexity of producible shapes of size N for a sufficiently large - but finite - set of tiles. Our results demonstrate the importance of physical mechanisms, and specifically geometric constraints, in facilitating efficient use of the information in molecular programs for structure assembly.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation (AR) in a double-well potential. We explore the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering behaviors in an asymmetric potential trap. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain a phase diagram that illustrates flocking behavior as a function of active reorientation and potential asymmetry. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling exponent, we identify distinct diffusion regimes. Our findings demonstrate that active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in double-well potentials.</description>
