      <title>Deep Learning, Predictability, and Optimal Portfolio Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic portfolio selection of an investor who uses deep learning methods to forecast stock market excess returns. In a two-asset allocation problem, deep neural networks -- both feedforward and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent architectures -- deliver economically significant gains in terms of certainty equivalent returns and Sharpe ratios relative to linear predictive regressions. These gains are robust to alternative performance measures, the inclusion of transaction costs, borrowing and short-selling constraints, different rebalancing horizons, and subsample splits, and are particularly pronounced during NBER recessions and periods with large return swings. Within the class of neural networks we consider, economic performance is broadly similar across architectures, with the recurrent LSTM specification providing incremental benefits with more frequent rebalancing. Overall, our evidence suggests that exploiting the time-series structure of standard predictor variables via deep learning can generate meaningful portfolio improvements for investors beyond those obtained from linear models.</description>

      <title>A hidden Markov model for statistical arbitrage in international crude oil futures markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study statistical arbitrage strategies in international crude oil futures markets. We analyse strategies that extend classical pairs trading strategies, considering the two benchmark crude oil futures (Brent and WTI) together with the newly introduced Shanghai crude oil futures. We document that the time series of these three futures prices are cointegrated and we model the resulting cointegration spread by a mean-reverting regime-switching process modulated by a hidden Markov chain. By relying on our stochastic model and applying online filter-based parameter estimators, we implement and test a number of statistical arbitrage strategies. Our analysis reveals that statistical arbitrage strategies involving the Shanghai crude oil futures are profitable even under conservative levels of transaction costs and over different time periods. On the contrary, statistical arbitrage strategies involving the three traditional crude oil futures (Brent, WTI, Dubai) do not yield profitable investment opportunities. Our findings suggest that the Shanghai futures, which has already become the benchmark for the Chinese domestic crude oil market, can be a valuable asset for international investors.</description>
