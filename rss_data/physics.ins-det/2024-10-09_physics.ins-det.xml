      <title>Coherent Control of $\gamma$-Ray Intensity Waveforms by Vibrating Resonant Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a method for coherent control of the $\gamma$-photons enabling the shaping of $\gamma$-ray intensity in various waveforms. The creation of different intensity waveforms is achieved by adjusting the motion profile of the resonant absorber and tuning the energy of the incident radiation. A crucial aspect of this methodology is the utilisation of a low fundamental frequency of the vibrations, which makes experiments feasible and broadens the possibilities of $\gamma$-ray control. The results of numerical simulations are proved experimentally by generating single and double $\gamma$-pulses, and inducing short-term absorption using different absorber motion profiles composed of 12 harmonics with the fundamental frequency of 1 MHz. The proposed technique represents advancement in the manipulation of $\gamma$-rays and x-rays, paving the way for the performance of new types of $\gamma$-ray or x-ray quantum experiments and the development of new tools such as adjustable table-top $\gamma$-pulse sources or $\gamma$-ray or x-ray delays and gates.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Application of a Radon Diffusion Chamber for Determining Diffusion Coefficients in Membrane Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the issue of radon emanation and diffusion has become a critical concern for rare decay experiments, such as JUNO and PandaX-4T. This paper introduces a detector design featuring a symmetric radon detector cavity for the quantitative assessment of membrane materials' radon blocking capabilities. The performance of this design is evaluated through the application of Fick's Law and the diffusion equation considering material solubility. Our detector has completed measurements of radon diffusion coefficients for four types of membrane materials currently used in experiments, which also confirms the rationality of this detector design. The findings are instrumental in guiding the selection and evaluation of optimal materials for radon shielding to reduce radon background, contributing to boost sensitivities of rare event research.</description>

      <title>High-speed ultra-broadband detection based on interfacial work function internal photoemission detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed ultra-broadband detectors play a crucial role in aerospace technology, and national security etc. The interfacial work function internal photoemission (IWIP) detector employs multiple absorption mechanism comprehensively across different wavelength band to achieve complete photon type detection, which makes it possible to realize high-speed and ultra-broadband simultaneously. We propose a ratchet heterojunction IWIP (HEIWIP) detector, which shows 3-165THz ultra-broadband coverage. The high-speed response is investigated in detail by both microwave rectification technology and high-speed modulated terahertz light. Up to 5.1GHz 3dB bandwidth is acquired in terms of microwave rectification measurement. And 4.255GHz inter-mode optical beat note signal was successfully detected.</description>

      <title>Development of hafnium-based transition edge sensor bolometers for cosmic microwave background polarimetry experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry experiments aim to deploy order 500,000 detectors, requiring repeatable and reliable fabrication process with stable and uniform transition edge sensor (TES) bolometer performance. We present a hafnium (Hf)-based TES bolometer for CMB experiments. We employ a novel heated sputter deposition of the Hf films enabling us to finely tune the critical temperature (Tc) between 140 mK - 210 mK. We found elevated deposition temperatures result in films with lower stress, larger crystal sizes, and a smaller relative abundance of the m-plane to c-plane $\alpha$ phase, all contributing to the empirical linear dependence of critical temperature on deposition temperature. Crucially, the heated sputter deposition simultaneously ensures that the critical temperature does not drift despite exposure to heat throughout ongoing fab processes (sometimes reaching 350C) as long as the initial deposition temperature is not exceeded. Tcs lower than 170 mK require deposition temperature greater than 400C, far in excess of typical temperatures the wafer may experience. This ample thermal budget allows us to relax the stringent thermal management that conventional aluminum manganese (AlMn) TES bolometers require, for which temperatures as low as 200C - 250C are used to anneal the AlMn in an effort to adjust the Tc. Hf additionally exhibits an intrinsic steep superconducting transition (we measure $\alpha &gt;$ 200) and a corresponding high loop gain (exceeding $\mathcal{L}&gt;10$ deep in the transition). We precisely design the normal resistance of the TES to range between 10 milli-Ohm and 1 Ohm through an interdigitated geometry, making these TES bolometers compatible with both TDM, FDM, and $\mu$-mux readout systems. We report on bolometer parameters including critical temperature, normal resistance, saturation power, time constant, and loop gain.</description>

      <title>In-situ crystallographic mapping constrains sulfate deposition and timing in Jezero crater, Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Late-stage Ca-sulfate-filled fractures are common on Mars. Notably, the Shenandoah formation in the western edge of Jezero crater preserves a variety of Ca-sulfate minerals in the fine-grained siliciclastic rocks explored by the Perseverance rover. However, the depositional environment and timing of the formation of these sulfates is unknown. To address this outstanding problem, we developed a new technique to map the crystal textures of these sulfates in situ at two stratigraphically similar locations in the Shenandoah formation, allowing us to constrain the burial depth and paleoenvironment at the time of their deposition. Our results suggest that some Ca-sulfate analyzed was formed at a burial depth greater than 80m, whereas Ca-sulfates present at another outcrop likely precipitated in a shallow-subsurface environment. These results indicate that samples collected for potential return to Earth at the two studied locations capture two different times and distinct chemical conditions in the depositional history of the Shenandoah formation providing multiple opportunities to evaluate surface and subsurface habitability.</description>

      <title>Infrared Bolometers Based on 40-nm-Thick Nano-Thermoelectric Silicon Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of the-art infrared photodetectors operating in the mid- and long-wavelength infrared (MWIR and LWIR) are largely dominated by cryogenically cooled quantum sensors when the target is the highest sensitivity and detection speeds. Nano-thermoelectrics provide a route towards competitive uncooled infrared bolometer technology that can obtain high speed and sensitivity, low-power operation, and cost-effectiveness. We demonstrate nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers with fast and high-sensitivity response to LWIR around 10 $\mu$m. These devices are based on ultra-thin silicon membranes that utilize the dimensional scaling of silicon nanomembranes in thermoelectric elements and are combined with metallic nanomembranes with subwavelength absorber structures. The fast device performance stems from a low heat capacity design where the thermoelectric beams act both as mechanical supports and transducer elements. Furthermore, by scaling down the thickness of the thermoelectric beams the thermal conductivity is reduced owing to enhanced phonon boundary scattering, resulting in increased sensitivity. The nano-thermoelectric LWIR bolometers are based on 40-nm-thick n- and p-type silicon membranes with LWIR (voltage) responsivities up to 1636 V/W and 1350 V/W and time constants in the range of 300-600 $\mu$s, resulting in specific detectivities up to $1.56\times10^8$ cmHz$^{1/2}$/W. We also investigate the use of a heavily doped N++ substrate to increase optical cavity back reflection, resulting in an increased Si substrate reflectance from 30% to 70%-75% for wavelengths between 8-10 $\mu$m, resulting in an increase in device responsivity by approximately 20%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of experiments for rare-event searches based on skipper Charge Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) presents new challenges for the sensor packaging and readout. Scaling the active mass and simultaneously reducing the experimental backgrounds in orders of magnitude requires a novel high-density silicon-based package that must be massively produced and tested. In this work, we present the design, fabrication, testing, and empirical signal model of a multi-channel silicon package. In addition, we outline the chosen specifications for the ongoing production of 1500 wafers that will add up to a 10 kg skipper-CCD array with 24000 readout channels.</description>

Abstract: We are developing a single-ion optical clock based on a surface-electrode (SE) trap that we will operate with $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions on the electric quadrupole transition at 435.5 nm. We present heating rate measurements performed with a prototype SE trap. We also introduce a new, micro-fabricated SE trapping chip using silicon on insulator technology.

Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication is critical for the non-invasive in-situ monitoring of vital signs in deep tissues. Wireless ultrasonic links demonstrated so far solved the shortcomings of electromagnetic wave-based communication methods. However, they either require highly customized and complex designs for the implant electronics or rely on physical changes in implanted metamaterials. Here, we report a wireless, passive, frequency-based, and electronics-free ultrasonic communication method for deep tissue sensor implants. The device consists of a piezoelectric crystal used as the ultrasonic antenna, considerably simplifying the implant design, and can be integrated with any capacitive implantable sensor. We demonstrate the applicability of the passive communication method using a commercial pressure sensor at a depth of 5 cm with decent precision and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Stress-induced Artificial neuron spiking in Diffusive memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusive memristors owing to their ability to produce current spiking when a constant or slowly changing voltage is applied are competitive candidates for the development of artificial electronic neurons. These artificial neurons can be integrated into various prospective autonomous and robotic systems as sensors, e.g. ones implementing object grasping and classification. We report here Ag nanoparticle-based diffusive memristor prepared on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate in which the electric spiking behaviour was induced by the electric voltage under an additional stimulus of external mechanical impact. By changing the magnitude and frequency of the mechanical impact, we are able to manipulate the spiking response of our artificial neuron. This functionality to control the spiking characterstics paves a pathway for the development of touch-perception sensors that can convert local pressure into electrical spikes for further processing in neural networks. We have proposed a mathematical model which captures the operation principle of the fabricated memristive sensors and qualitatively describes the measured spiking behaviour.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method that is accurate down to a single-photon level and provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a short rigid piece of few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of biological specimens and the liquid crystal polymer sample (birefringent USAF test). Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>
