      <title>Subdomains of Post-COVID-Syndrome (PCS) -- A Population-Based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), encompassing the multifaceted sequelae of COVID-19, can be severity-graded using a score comprising 12 different long-term symptom complexes. Acute COVID-19 severity and individual resilience were previously identified as key predictors of this score. This study validated these predictors and examined their relationship to PCS symptom complexes, using an expanded dataset (n=3,372) from the COVIDOM cohort study. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis resolved the detailed relationship between the predictors and the constituting symptom complexes of the PCS score. Among newly recruited COVIDOM participants (n=1,930), the PCS score was again found to be associated with both its putative predictors. Of the score-constituting symptom complexes, neurological symptoms, sleep disturbance, and fatigue were predicted by individual resilience, whereas acute disease severity predicted exercise intolerance, chemosensory deficits, joint or muscle pain, signs of infection, and fatigue. These associations inspired the definition of two novel PCS scores that included the above-mentioned subsets of symptom complexes only. Both novel scores were inversely correlated with quality of life, measured by the EQ-5D-5L index. The newly defined scores may enhance the assessment of PCS severity, both in a research context and to delineate distinct PCS subdomains with different therapeutic and interventional needs in clinical practise.</description>

      <title>Modeling HIF-ILK Interaction Using Continuous Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen concentration in tumor micro-environment is a well-established signal that can induce aggressive cancer behaviour. In particular, low oxygen levels (hypoxia) activate the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor(HIF) pathway which has an array of target systems. One of these systems is Integrin-Linked Kinase (ILK) pathway, which influences key signaling pathways for cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Hence, this paper aimed to explore the interconnection between these two pathways. Using the Petri net modeling tool Snoopy, an established HIF network model was transformed to be a continuous Petri net. Subsequently, the network was expanded to incorporate a feedback element from the ILK pathway to HIF, based on gene expression data. The resulting model conserved the oxygen switch response of the original HIF model and positively amplified HIF's output. Therefore, this model provides a starting point for establishing a system reflecting crucial effect on hypoxia-induced cancer behavior, and could potentially serve as a basis for future drug development.</description>

      <title>Petri Net Modeling of Root Hair Response to Phosphate Starvation in Arabidopsis Thaliana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited availability of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in soil is an important constraint to plant growth. In order to understand better the underlying mechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal language suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses to deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair elongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the transcription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found to be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could simulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair length, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably, discrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role for RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current study could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction between RSL2 and RSL4.</description>

      <title>Interpretable High-order Knowledge Graph Neural Network for Predicting Synthetic Lethality in Human Cancers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising gene interaction for cancer therapy. Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</description>

      <title>Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival.</description>

      <title>Global Context Is All You Need for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-brain tractography in diffusion MRI is often followed by a parcellation in which each streamline is classified as belonging to a specific white matter bundle, or discarded as a false positive. Efficient parcellation is important both in large-scale studies, which have to process huge amounts of data, and in the clinic, where computational resources are often limited. TractCloud is a state-of-the-art approach that aims to maximize accuracy with a local-global representation. We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to the accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with pathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation. PETParc is a transformer-based architecture in which the whole-brain tractogram is randomly partitioned into sub-tractograms whose streamlines are classified in parallel, while serving as global context for each other. This leads to a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude relative to TractCloud, and permits inference even on clinical workstations without a GPU. PETParc accounts for the lack of streamline orientation either via a novel flip-invariant embedding, or by simply using flips as part of data augmentation. Despite the speedup, results are often even better than those of prior methods. The code and pretrained model will be made public upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>The 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas: spatiotemporal atlas generation for rapid anatomical changes using first-trimester ultrasound from the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer Self-Supervised Learning for High-Content Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning methods often fail to learn subtle or complex features, which can be dominated by simpler patterns which are much easier to learn. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.</description>

      <title>Age Group Sensitivity Analysis of Epidemic Models: Investigating the Impact of Contact Matrix Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role of different age groups in disease transmission is crucial for designing effective intervention strategies. A key parameter in age-structured epidemic models is the contact matrix, which defines the interaction structure between age groups. However, accurately estimating contact matrices is challenging, as different age groups respond differently to surveys and are accessible through different channels. This variability introduces significant epistemic uncertainty in epidemic models.
  In this study, we introduce the Age Group Sensitivity Analysis (AGSA) method, a novel framework for assessing the impact of age-structured contact patterns on epidemic outcomes. Our approach integrates age-stratified epidemic models with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) method, enabling a systematic sensitivity analysis of age-specific interactions. Additionally, we propose a new sensitivity aggregation technique that quantifies the contribution of each age group to key epidemic parameters.
  By identifying the age groups to which the model is most sensitive, AGSA helps pinpoint those that introduce the greatest epistemic uncertainty. This allows for targeted data collection efforts, focusing surveys and empirical studies on the most influential age groups to improve model accuracy. As a result, AGSA can enhance epidemic forecasting and inform the design of more effective and efficient public health interventions.</description>

      <title>BixBench: a Comprehensive Benchmark for LLM-based Agents in Computational Biology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents show great promise in accelerating scientific research. Existing benchmarks for measuring this potential and guiding future development continue to evolve from pure recall and rote knowledge tasks, towards more practical work such as literature review and experimental planning. Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting. By exposing the current limitations of frontier models, we hope BixBench can spur the development of agents capable of conducting rigorous bioinformatic analysis and accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>VenusMutHub: A systematic evaluation of protein mutation effect predictors on small-scale experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In protein engineering, while computational models are increasingly used to predict mutation effects, their evaluations primarily rely on high-throughput deep mutational scanning (DMS) experiments that use surrogate readouts, which may not adequately capture the complex biochemical properties of interest. Many proteins and their functions cannot be assessed through high-throughput methods due to technical limitations or the nature of the desired properties, and this is particularly true for the real industrial application scenario. Therefore, the desired testing datasets, will be small-size (~10-100) experimental data for each protein, and involve as many proteins as possible and as many properties as possible, which is, however, lacking. Here, we present VenusMutHub, a comprehensive benchmark study using 905 small-scale experimental datasets curated from published literature and public databases, spanning 527 proteins across diverse functional properties including stability, activity, binding affinity, and selectivity. These datasets feature direct biochemical measurements rather than surrogate readouts, providing a more rigorous assessment of model performance in predicting mutations that affect specific molecular functions. We evaluate 23 computational models across various methodological paradigms, such as sequence-based, structure-informed and evolutionary approaches. This benchmark provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate prediction methods in protein engineering applications where accurate prediction of specific functional properties is crucial.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks detects regions disrupted by neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theoretical methods have proven valuable for investigating alterations in both anatomical and functional brain connectivity networks during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that representing brain networks in a suitable geometric space can better capture their connectivity structure. This study introduces a novel approach to characterize brain connectivity changes using low dimensional, informative representations of networks in a latent geometric space. Specifically, the networks are embedded in a polar representation of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic disk. Here, we use a geometric score, entirely based on the computation of distances between nodes in the latent space, to measure the effect of a perturbation on the nodes. Precisely, the score is a local measure of distortion in the geometric neighborhood of a node following a perturbation. The method is applied to a brain network dataset of patients with AD and healthy participants, derived from diffusion weighted (DWI) and functional (fMRI) magnetic resonance imaging scans. We show that, compared with standard graph measures, our method more accurately identifies the brain regions most affected by neurodegeneration. Notably, the abnormalities detected in memory related and frontal areas are robust across multiple brain parcellation scales. Finally, our findings suggest that the geometric perturbation score could serve as a potential biomarker for characterizing the progression of the disease.</description>

Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.</description>

Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</description>
