      <title>Presheaf automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce presheaf automata as a generalisation of different variants of higher-dimensional automata and other automata-like formalisms, including Petri nets and vector addition systems. We develop the foundations of a language theory for them based on notions of paths and track objects. We also define open maps for presheaf automata, extending the standard notions of simulation and bisimulation for transition systems. Apart from these conceptual contributions, we show that certain finite-type presheaf automata subsume all Petri nets, generalising a previous result by van Glabbeek, which applies to higher-dimensional automata and safe Petri nets.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Assumptions for Effective Monitoring of Real-Time Properties under Partial Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runtime verification of temporal properties over timed sequences of observations is crucial in various applications within cyber-physical systems ranging from autonomous vehicles over smart grids to medical devices. In this paper, we are addressing the challenge of effectively predicting the failure or success of properties in a continuous real-time setting. Our approach allows predictions to exploit assumptions on the system being monitored and supports predictions of non-observable system behaviour (e.g. internal faults). More concretely, in our approach properties are expressed in Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL), assumptions on the monitored system are specified in terms of Timed Automata, and observations are to be provided in terms of sequences of timed constraints. We present an assumption-based runtime verification algorithm and its implementation on top of the real-time verification tool UPPAAL. We show experimentally that assumptions can be effective in anticipating the satisfaction/violation of timed properties and in handling monitoring properties that predicate over unobservable events.</description>

      <title>State estimation of timed automata under partial observation [Draft version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider partially observable timed automata endowed with a single clock. A time interval is associated with each transition specifying at which clock values it may occur. In addition, a resetting condition associated to a transition specifies how the clock value is updated upon its occurrence. This work deals with the estimation of the current state given a timed observation, i.e., a succession of pairs of an observable event and the time instant at which the event has occurred. The problem of state reachability in the timed automaton is reduced to the reachability analysis of the associated zone automaton, which provides a purely discrete event description of the behaviour of the timed automaton. An algorithm is formulated to provide an offline approach for state estimation of a timed automaton based on the assumption that the clock is reset upon the occurrence of each observable transition.</description>

      <title>Deciding the synthesis problem for hybrid games through bisimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid games are games played on a finite graph endowed with real variables which may model behaviors of discrete controllers of continuous systems. The synthesis problem for hybrid games is decidable for classical objectives (like LTL formulas) when the games are initialized singular, meaning that the slopes of the continuous variables are piecewise constant and variables are reset whenever their slope changes. The known proof adapts the region construction from timed games. In this paper we show that initialized singular games can be reduced, via a sequence of alternating bisimulations, to timed games, generalizing the known reductions by bisimulation from initialized singular automata to timed automata. Alternating bisimulation is the generalization of bisimulation to games, accomodating a strategy translation lemma by which, when two games are bisimilar and carry the same observations, each strategy in one of the games can be translated to a strategy in the second game such that all the outcomes of the second strategy satisfies the same property that are satisfied by the first strategy. The advantage of the proposed approach is that one may then use realizability tools for timed games to synthesize a winning strategy for a given objective, and then use the strategy translation lemma to obtain a winning strategy in the hybrid game for the same objective.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Recurrent Neural Cascades with Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Cascades (RNC) are the class of recurrent neural networks with no cyclic dependencies among recurrent neurons. Their subclass RNC+ with positive recurrent weights has been shown to be closely connected to the star-free regular languages, which are the expressivity of many well-established temporal logics. The existing expressivity results show that the regular languages captured by RNC+ are the star-free ones, and they leave open the possibility that RNC+ may capture languages beyond regular. We exclude this possibility for languages that include an identity element, i.e., an input that can occur an arbitrary number of times without affecting the output. Namely, in the presence of an identity element, we show that the languages captured by RNC+ are exactly the star-free regular languages. Identity elements are ubiquitous in temporal patterns, and hence our results apply to a large number of applications. The implications of our results go beyond expressivity. At their core, we establish a close structural correspondence between RNC+ and semiautomata cascades, showing that every neuron can be equivalently captured by a three-state semiautomaton. A notable consequence of this result is that RNC+ are no more succinct than cascades of three-state semiautomata.</description>
