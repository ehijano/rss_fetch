      <title>Language-specific Tonal Features Drive Speaker-Listener Neural Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.</description>

      <title>Phase Alignment Enhances Oscillatory Power in Neural Mass Models Optimized for Class Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural encoding of objects and cognitive states remains an elusive yet crucial aspect of brain function. While traditional feed-forward machine learning neural networks have enormous potential to encode information, modern architectures provide little insight into the brain's mechanisms. In this work, a Jansen and Rit neural mass model was constructed to encode different sets of inputs, aiming to understand how simple neural circuits can represent information. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize parameters that maximized the differences in responses to particular inputs. These differences in responses manifested as phase-shifted oscillations across the set of inputs. By delivering impulses of excitation synchronized with a particular phase-shifted oscillation, we demonstrated that the encoded phase could be decoded by measuring oscillatory power. These findings demonstrate the capability of neural dynamical circuits to encode and decode information through phase.</description>

      <title>The Amplitude Modulation Structure of Japanese Infant- and Child-Directed Speech: Longitudinal Data Reveal Universal Acoustic Physical Structures Underpinning Moraic Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infant-directed speech (IDS) is highly rhythmic, and in European languages IDS is dominated by patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) at ~2Hz (reflecting prosody) and ~5Hz (reflecting individual syllables). The rhythm structure of spoken Japanese is thought to differ from European stress-timed and syllable-timed languages, depending on moraic units. Morae comprise any onset phoneme and vowel phonemes within a syllable, PA-N-DA. Arguably, initial speech encoding via cortical tracking by infants is likely to utilize language-universal physical acoustic structures in speech rather than language-specific structures like morae, since the infant brain must be prepared to acquire any human language. Here a language-blind computational model of linguistic rhythm based on features of the amplitude envelope is used to compute these physical acoustic stimulus characteristics for Japanese. Using ~18,000 samples of natural IDS and child-directed speech (CDS) recorded longitudinally from 6 parents while speaking to their children over the ages 0-5 years, we find that the temporal modulation patterns that characterise the amplitude envelope of Japanese are highly similar to those found for stress-timed and syllable-timed European languages. However, the AM band corresponding to the syllabic level in CDS/IDS in European languages (~2-12Hz, theta-rate cortical tracking) was elongated in Japanese (2.5-17Hz). Further, the phase synchronization ratios between the two slowest AM bands were as likely to be 1:3 as 1:2, which differs from European languages where 1:2 ratios are dominant. Accordingly, the language-universal amplitude-driven physical acoustic structures important for cortical speech tracking flexibly accommodate language-specific differences in core rhythmic units.</description>

      <title>Three tiers of computation in transformers and in brain architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specific empirical phenomena spanning human natural language, and mathematical and logical abilities, are rigorously situated in the well-studied grammar-automata (G-A) hierarchy. We identify three tiers and corresponding two transitions within the hierarchy and show their correspondence to the emergence of particular abilities in humans and in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of "scaling"; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require specific training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems yet still struggle with logical processing. The resulting principled analyses provide underlying explanatory accounts of both the abilities and shortfalls of these systems, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of logic abilities in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Alzheimer's Diagnosis: Leveraging Anatomical Landmarks in Graph Convolutional Neural Networks on Tetrahedral Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <title>Holistic structure of neural pathways underlies brain perceptual rivalry: Physical mechanism of auditory stream segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain perceptual rivalry, exemplified by auditory stream segregation of competing tones (A_, B__, ABA_), serves as a core mechanism of brain perception formation. While increasingly recognized as determining by neural connections rather than specific neural groups, the mechanism of brain perception remains uncertain. We demonstrate that auditory stream segregation arises from the topological structure of holistic neural pathways. By constructing a holistic pathway model using existing neurophysiological data, combining nonlinear neural dynamics and nonequilibrium physics, we uncover the biophysical mechanism of perceptual phase transitions from integrated (ABA_) to segregated streams (A_ or B_), as well as the mechanism of temporal dynamics, perceptual switching path, and attention regulation underlying these transitions. Further, we demonstrate how our framework reveals energy consumption of the auditory system and combines it with neuroelectrophysiology. Two psycho-acoustic experiments validate our predictions of perception alternation and attention modulation. Our framework provides a transformative perspective on how brain networks generate complex perceptual experiences, emphasizing the significance of neural pathway structure in the process of brain function realization.</description>

      <title>Predictive Strategies for the Control of Complex Motor Skills: Recent Insights into Individual and Joint Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans perform exquisite sensorimotor skills, both individually and in teams, from athletes performing rhythmic gymnastics to everyday tasks like carrying a cup of coffee. The "predictive brain" framework suggests that mastering these skills relies on predictive mechanisms, raising the question of how we deploy predictions for real-time control and coordination. This review highlights two research lines, showing that during the control of complex objects people make the interaction with 'tools' predictable; and that during dyadic coordination people make their behavior predictable and legible for their partners. These studies demonstrate that to achieve sophisticated motor skills, we play "prediction tricks": we select subspaces of predictable solutions and make sensorimotor interactions more predictable and legible by and for others. This synthesis underscores the critical role of predictability in optimizing control strategies across contexts. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for novel studies on the scope and limits of predictive mechanisms in motor control.</description>

      <title>Learning to Chain Operations by Routing Information Through a Global Workspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.</description>
