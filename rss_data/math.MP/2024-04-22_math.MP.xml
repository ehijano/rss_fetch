      <title>Geometry of spinors: doubly-chiral plane-wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the polar re-formulation of spinor fields to see in a new light their classification into regular and singular spinors, these last also called flag-dipoles, further splitting into the sub-classes of dipoles and flagpoles: in particular, we will study the conditions under which flagpoles may be solutions of the Dirac field equations. We argue for an enlargement of the plane-wave expansion.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for Hitchin systems with the structure group $SO(4)$, on genus two curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sets of points giving spectral curves can be regarded as phase coordinates of Hitchin systems. We address the problem of finding out trajectories of Hitchin systems in those coordinates. The problem is being solved for the systems with structure groups $SO(4)$ and $SL(2)$ on genus 2 curves. Our method is a transfer of straight line windings of fibers of the Hitchin map, which are given by Prymians of the spectral curves for the systems with simple classical structure groups. The transfer is carried out by means of an analog of the Jacobi inversion map, which does not exist for Prymians in general but can be defined in the two cases in question.</description>

      <title>Maxwell's and Stokes' operators associated with elliptic differential complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new technique to generate reasonable systems of partial differential equations (PDE) that could be potential candidates for depicting models in natural sciences related to quasi-linear equations. Such systems appear within typical constructions of the Homological Algebra as complexes of differential operators describing compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems of PDE's. The related models can be both steady and evolutionary. Additional assumptions on the ellipticity of the differential complex provide a wide class of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic operators that could be generated in this way. In particular, it appears that an essentially large amount of equations related to the modern Mathematical Physics is generated by the de Rham complex of differentials on the exterior differential forms. These includes the elliptic Laplace and Lam\'e type operators; the parabolic heat transfer equation; the Euler type and Navier-Stokes type equations in Hydrodynamics; the hyperbolic wave equation and the Maxwell equations in Electrodynamics; the Klein-Gordon equation in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics; and so on. Our model generation method covers a broad class of generating systems, especially in higher spatial dimensions, due to different basic algebraic structures at play.</description>

      <title>Regularization Techniques for Estimating the Source in a Complete Parabolic Equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the problem of identifying the source term in transport processes given by a complete parabolic equation is studied mathematically from noisy measurements taken at an arbitrary fixed time. The problem is solved analytically with Fourier techniques and it is shown that this solution is not stable. Three single parameter families of regularization operators are proposed to dealt with the instability of the solution. Each of them is designed to compensate the factor that causes the instability of the inverse operator. Moreover, a rule of choice for the regularization parameter is included and a H\"older error bound type is obtained for each estimation. Numerical examples of different characteristics are presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed strategies.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect of a rough membrane in an Aether-like Lorentz-violating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonexistence of nontrivial time-periodic solutions of the Dirac equation in Kerr-Newman-(A)dS spacetime. In the non-extreme Kerr-Newman-dS spacetime, we prove that there is no nontrivial $L^p$ integrable Dirac particle for arbitrary $(\lambda,p)\in \mathbb{R}\times[2,+\infty)$. In the extreme Kerr-Newman-dS and extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, we show the equation relations between the energy eigenvalue $\omega$, the horizon radius, the angular momentum, the electric charge and the cosmological constant if there exists nontrivial $L^p$ integrable time-periodic solution of the Dirac equation, and further give the necessary conditions for the existence of nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Persistent and anti-Persistent Motion in Bounded and Unbounded Space: Resolution of the First-Passage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.</description>

      <title>Wave-driven phase wave patterns in a ring of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a biomimetic model that simulates a cell, with the internal cytoplasm represented by a two-dimensional circular domain and the external cortex by a surrounding ring, both modeled using FitzHugh-Nagumo systems. The external ring is dynamically influenced by a pacemaker-driven wave originating from the internal domain, leading to the emergence of three distinct dynamical states based on the varying strengths of coupling. The range of dynamics observed includes phase patterning, the propagation of phase waves, and interactions between traveling and phase waves. A simplified linear model effectively explains the mechanisms behind the variety of phase patterns observed, providing insights into the complex interplay between a cell's internal and external environments.</description>

      <title>Stationary Measure of the Open KPZ Equation through the Enaud-Derrida Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works of Barraquand and Le Doussal and Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang, and Wesolowski gave a description of the open KPZ stationary measure as the sum of a Brownian motion and a Brownian motion reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. Subsequent work of Barraquand and Le Doussal used the Enaud-Derrida representation of the DEHP algebra to formulate the open ASEP stationary measure in terms of the sum of a random walk and a random walk reweighted by a Radon-Nikodym derivative. They show that this Radon-Nikodym derivative converges pointwise to the Radon-Nikodym derivative that characterizes the open KPZ stationary measure. This article proves that the corresponding sequence of measures converges weakly to the open KPZ stationary measure. This provides an alternative proof of the probabilistic formulation of the open KPZ stationary measure, which avoids dealing explicitly with finite dimensional distributions. We also provide the first construction of the measure on intervals of a general length and for the full range of parameters in the fan region $(u+v&gt;0)$.</description>

      <title>Topological Equatorial Waves and Violation (or not) of the Bulk Edge Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric and oceanic mass transport near the equator display a well-studied asymmetry characterized by two modes moving eastward. This asymmetric edge transport is characteristic of interfaces separating two-dimensional topological insulators. The northern and southern hemispheres are insulating because of the presence of a Coriolis force parameter that vanishes only in the vicinity of the equator. A central tenet of topological insulators, the bulk edge correspondence, relates the quantized edge asymmetry to bulk properties of the insulating phases, which makes it independent of the Coriolis force profile near the equator. We show that for a natural differential Hamiltonian model of the atmospheric and oceanic transport, the bulk-edge correspondence does not always apply. In fact, an arbitrary quantized asymmetry can be obtained for specific, discontinuous, such profiles. The results are based on a careful analysis of the spectral flow of the branches of absolutely continuous spectrum of a shallow-water Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we plan to show an eigenvalue algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices by using the idea of non-commutative integrable systems and matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials. We introduce adjacent families of matrix-valued $\theta$-deformed bi-orthogonal polynomials, and derive corresponding discrete non-commutative hungry Toda lattice from discrete spectral transformations for polynomials. It is shown that this discrete system can be used as a pre-precessing algorithm for block Hessenberg matrices. Besides, some convergence analysis and numerical examples of this algorithm are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interrelation between the concepts of self-consistency, relativism and many-particle systems is considered within the framework of a unified consideration of classical and quantum physics based on the first principle of the probability conservation law. The probability conservation law underlies the Vlasov equation chain. From the first Vlasov equation, the Schr\"odinger equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the equation of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the Maxwell equations, the Pauli equation and the Dirac equation are constructed. The paper shows with mathematical rigor that quantum systems with a time independent function of quasi-density probability in phase space are not capable to emit electromagnetic radiation. It is shown that at the micro-level a quantum object may be considered rather as an {\guillemotleft}extended{\guillemotright} object than a point one. And the hydrodynamic description of continuum mechanics is applicable for such an object. A number of exact solutions of quantum and classical model systems is considered, demonstrating a new insight at the quantum mechanics representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative particle system characterized by moderate interactions, designed to accurately approximate kinetic flocking models that incorporate singular interaction forces and local alignment mechanisms. We establish the existence of weak solutions to the corresponding flocking equations and provide an error estimate for the mean-field limit. This is achieved through the regularization of singular forces and a nonlocal approximation strategy for local alignments. We show that, by selecting the regularization and localization parameters logarithmically with respect to the number of particles, the particle system effectively approximates the mean-field equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel reformulation of the mean-field system for pulse-coupled oscillators. It is based on writing a closed equation for the inverse distribution function associated to the probability density of oscillators with a given phase in a suitable time scale. This new framework allows to show a hidden contraction/expansion of certain distances leading to a full clarification of the long-time behavior, existence of steady states, rates of convergence, and finite time blow-up of classical solutions for a large class of monotone phase response functions. In the process, we get insights about the origin of obstructions to global-in-time existence and uniform in time estimates on the firing rate of the oscillators.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a $\textit{parsimonious}$ manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the $\gamma$ Eddington parameter, which reads $\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\varTheta}$, where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This $\textit{non-perturbative}$ result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian $\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$ expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value $\gamma_{\,\text{GR}}=1$ as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case $\varTheta$ approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. $\omega&gt;-3/2$, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

      <title>Residual Entropy of Hexagonal Ice and Cubic Ice: A Transfer Matrix Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual entropy of ice systems has long been a significant and intriguing issue in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The exact solutions for the residual entropy of realistic three-dimensional ice systems remain unknown. In this study, we focus on two typical realistic ice systems, namely the hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic). We present a transfer matrix description of the number of ice-ruled configurations for these two systems. First, a transfer matrix M is constructed for ice Ic, where each element is the number of ice-ruled configurations of a hexagonal monolayer under certain condition. The product of M and its transpose corresponds to a bilayer unit in ice Ih lattice, therefore is exactly a transfer matrix for ice Ih. Making use of this, we simply show that the residual entropy of ice Ih is not less than that of ice Ic in the thermodynamic limit, which was first proved by Onsager in 1960s. Furthermore, we find an alternative transfer matrix M' for ice Ih, which is based on a monolayer periodic unit. Some interesting properties of M, MMT and M' are illustrated, specifically the summation of all elements, the element in the first row and first column, and the trace. Each property is equivalent with the residual entropy of a two-dimensional ice model. Our work rediscovers the relationship between the residual entropies of ice Ih and ice Ic, and provides an effective description for various two-dimensional ice models.</description>

      <title>Solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation with two colors and nonnegative matrix entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we construct solutions to quantum tetrahedron equation in which there are two $\mathcal R$-operators each depending on one parameter, while these parameters are independent from each other. The equation is of the kind "with variables on the edges", and these variables take just two values (called sometimes "colors"). All matrix entries of our $\mathcal R$-operators are nonnegative, if the parameters are chosen properly, and the number of strictly positive entries is either 12 or 14.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into classical multiple orthogonal polynomials with an arbitrary number of weights, including Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of both first and second kinds, as well as multiple orthogonal Hermite polynomials. Novel explicit expressions for nearest-neighbor recurrence coefficients, as well as the step line case, are provided for all these polynomial families. Furthermore, new explicit expressions for type I multiple orthogonal polynomials are derived for Laguerre of the second kind and also for multiple Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum long-range models at zero temperature can be described by fractional Lifshitz field theories, that is, anisotropic models whose actions are short-range in time and long-range in space. In this paper we study the renormalization of fractional Lifshitz field theories with weakly relevant cubic or quartic self-interactions. Their nontrivial infrared fixed points exhibit Lifshitz scale invariance, and we compute the lowest-order corrections to the dynamic critical exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as an introduction to banded totally positive matrices, exploring various characterizations and associated properties. A significant result within is the demonstration that the collection of such matrices forms a semigroup, notably including a subset permitting positive bidiagonal factorization. Moreover, the paper applies this concept to investigate step line normality concerning the degrees of associated recursion polynomials. It presents a spectral Favard theorem, ensuring the existence of measures, thereby guaranteeing that these recursion polynomials represent mixed multiple orthogonal polynomials that maintain normality on the step line indices.</description>

      <title>Local univalence versus stability and causality in hydrodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main objective is to compare the analytic properties of hydrodynamic series with the stability and causality conditions applied to hydrodynamic modes. Analyticity, in this context, implies that the hydrodynamic series behaves as a univalent or single-valued function. Stability and causality adhere to physical constraints where hydrodynamic modes neither exhibit exponential growth nor travel faster than the speed of light. Through an examination of various hydrodynamic models, such as the Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) and the first-order hydro models like the BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) model, we observe no new restrictions stemming from the analyticity limits in the shear channel of these models. However, local univalence is maintained in the sound channel of these models despite the global divergence of the hydrodynamic series. Notably, differences in the sound equations between the MIS and BDNK models lead to distinct analyticity limits. The MIS model's sound mode remains univalent at high momenta within a specific transport range. Conversely, in the BDNK model, the univalence of the sound mode extends to intermediate momenta across all stable and causal regions. Generally, the convergence radius is independent of univalence and the given dispersion relation predominantly influences their correlation. For second-order frequency dispersions, the relationship is precise, i.e. within the convergence radius, the hydro series demonstrates univalence. However, with higher-order dispersions, the hydro series is locally univalent within certain transport regions, which may fall within or outside the stable and causal zones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We draw a parallel between the BV/BRST formalism for higher-dimensional ($\ge 2$) Hamiltonian mechanics and higher notions of torsion and basic curvature tensors for generalized connections in specific Lie $n$-algebroids based on homotopy Poisson structures. The gauge systems we consider include Poisson sigma models in any dimension and ``generalised R-flux'' deformations thereof, such as models with an $(n+2)$-form-twisted R-Poisson target space. Their BV/BRST action includes interaction terms among the fields, ghosts and antifields whose coefficients acquire a geometric meaning by considering twisted Koszul multibrackets that endow the target space with a structure that we call a gapped almost Lie $n$-algebroid. Studying covariant derivatives along $n$-forms, we define suitable polytorsion and basic polycurvature tensors and identify them with the interaction coefficients in the gauge theory, thus relating models for topological $n$-branes to differential geometry on Lie $n$-algebroids.</description>

Abstract: We present some rigorous results on the absence of a wide class of invariant measures for dynamical systems possessing attractors. We then consider a generalization of the classical nonholonomic Suslov problem which shows how previous investigations of existence of invariant measures for nonholonomic systems should necessarily be extended beyond the class of measures with strictly positive $C^1$ densities if one wishes to determine dynamical obstructions to the presence of attractors.</description>

      <title>Universal formal asymptotics for localized oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system of time-varying properties, embedded into a one-dimensional medium described by the telegraph equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quite general problem concerning a linear free oscillation of a discrete mass-spring-damper system. This discrete sub-system is embedded into a one-dimensional continuum medium described by the linear telegraph equation. In a particular case, the discrete sub-system can move along the continuum one at a sub-critical speed. Provided that the dissipation in both discrete and continuum sub-systems is absent, if parameters of the sub-systems are constants, under certain conditions (the localization conditions), a non-vanishing oscillation localized near the discrete sub-system can be possible. In the paper we assume that the dissipation in the damper and the medium is small, and all discrete-continuum system parameters are slowly varying functions in time and in space (when applicable), such that the localization condition is fulfilled for the instantaneous values of the parameters in a certain neighbourhood of the discrete sub-system position. This general statement can describe a number of mechanical systems of various nature. We derive the expression for the leading-order term of a universal asymptotics, which describes a localized oscillation of the discrete sub-system. In the non-dissipative case, the leading-order term of the expansion for the amplitude is found in the form of an algebraic expression, which involves the instantaneous values of the system parameters. In the dissipative case, the leading-order term for the amplitude, generally, is found in quadratures in the form of a functional, which depends on the history of the system parameters, though in some exceptional cases the result can be obtained as a function of time and the instantaneous limiting values of the system parameters. Finally, we have justified the universal asymptotics by numerical calculations for some particular cases.</description>

      <title>Methodological Reconstruction of Historical Landslide Tsunamis Using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indonesia is one of the world's most densely populated regions and lies among the epicenters of Earth's greatest natural hazards. Effectively reducing the disaster potential of these hazards through resource allocation and preparedness first requires an analysis of the risk factors of the region. Since destructive tsunamis present one of the most eminent dangers to coastal communities, understanding their sources and geological history is necessary to determine the potential future risk.
  Inspired by results from Cummins et al. 2020, and previous efforts that identified source parameters for earthquake-generated tsunamis, we consider landslide-generated tsunamis. This is done by constructing a probability distribution of potential landslide sources based on anecdotal observations of the 1852 Banda Sea tsunami, using Bayesian inference and scientific computing. After collecting over 100,000 samples (simulating 100,000 landslide induced tsunamis), we conclude that a landslide event provides a reasonable match to the tsunami reported in the anecdotal accounts. However, the most viable landslides may push the boundaries of geological plausibility. Future work creating a joint landslide-earthquake model may compensate for the weaknesses associated with an individual landslide or earthquake source event.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT relation, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Stark operator restricted to a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the semiclassical limit, a three-term asymptotic expansion for its individual eigenvalues has been established, with coefficients dependent on the curvature of $\Omega$. We analyse the accumulation of eigenvalues beneath the leading-order terms in these expansions, establishing Weyl-type asymptotics. Furthermore, we derive weak asymptotics for the density of the spectral projector onto these low-lying states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the long-term behavior of some special solutions to the Wave Kinetic Equation (WKE). This equation provides a mesoscopic description of wave systems interacting nonlinearly via the cubic NLS equation. Escobedo and Vel\'azquez showed that, starting with initial data given by countably many Dirac masses, solutions remain a linear combination of countably many Dirac masses at all times. Moreover, there is convergence to a single Dirac mass at long times. The first goal of this paper is to give quantitative rates for the speed of said convergence. In order to study the optimality of the bounds we obtain, we introduce and analyze a toy model accounting only for the leading order quadratic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic and evolution algebras arise naturally from applied probability and stochastic processes. Gibbs measures describe interacting systems commonly studied in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with applications in several fields. Here, we consider that the algebras are determined by configurations of finite spins on a countable set with their associated Gibbs distributions. The model preserves properties of the finite-dimensional Gibbs algebras found in the literature and extend their results. We introduce infertility in the genetic dynamics when the configurations differ macroscopically. It induces a decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of fertile ideals with genetic realization.
  The proposed infinite-dimensional algebras are commutative, non-associative, with uncountable basis and zero divisors. The properties of Gibbs measures allow us to deal with the difficulties arising from the algebraic structure and obtain the results presented in this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13830v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Hill's differential equation with potential expressed by elliptic functions which arises in some problems of physics and mathematics. Analytical method can be applied to study the local properties of the potential in asymptotic regions of the parameter space. The locations of the saddle points of the potential are determined, the locations of turning points can be determined too when they are close to a saddle point. Combined with the quadratic differential associated with the differential equation, these local data give a qualitative explanation for the asymptotic eigensolutions obtained recently. A relevant topic is about the generalisation of Floquet theorem for ODE with doubly-periodic elliptic function coefficient which bears some new features compared to the case of ODE with real valued singly-periodic coefficient. Beyond the local asymptotic regions, global properties of the elliptic potential are studied using numerical method.</description>

      <title>A master-slave coupling scheme for synchronization and parameter estimation in the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the constant parameters of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation from observed data has received attention from researchers in physics, applied mathematics and statistics. This is motivated by the various physical applications of the equation and, also, because it often serves as a test model for the study of space-time pattern formation. Remarkably, most existing inference techniques rely on statistical or machine learning tools, which are computationally very costly yet do not exploit the dynamical features of the system. In this paper we introduce a simple, online parameter estimation method that relies on the synchronization properties of the KS equation. In particular, we describe a master-slave setup where the slave model is driven by observations from the master system. The slave dynamics are data-driven and designed to continuously adapt the model parameters until identical synchronization with the master system is achieved. We provide a simple analysis that supports the proposed approach and also present and discuss the results of an extensive set of computer simulations. Our numerical study shows that the proposed method is computationally fast and also robust to initialization errors, observational noise and variations in the spatial resolution of the numerical scheme used to integrate the KS equation.</description>

      <title>Analysis on the cone of discrete Radon measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analysis on the cone of discrete Radon measures over a locally compact Polish space $X$. We discuss probability measures on the cone and the corresponding correlation measures and correlation functions on the sub-cone of finite discrete Radon measures over $X$. For this, we consider on the cone an analogue of the harmonic analysis on the configuration space developed in [12]. We also study elements of the difference calculus on the cone: we introduce discrete birth-and-death gradients and study the corresponding Dirichlet forms; finally, we discuss a system of polynomial functions on the cone which satisfy the binomial identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel lemma in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This lemma generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

Abstract: We consider Fokker-Planck equations that interpolate a pair of supersymmetrically related Fokker-Planck equations with constant coefficients. Based on the interesting property of shape-invariance, various one-parameter interpolations of the solutions of the supersymmetric pair of Fokker-Planck systems can be directly constructed.</description>

      <title>(Non-)unitarity of strictly and partially massless fermions on de Sitter space II: an explanation based on the group-theoretic properties of the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09851v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [Letsios 2023 J. High Energ. Phys. JHEP05(2023)015], we showed that the strictly massless spin-3/2 field, as well as the strictly and partially massless spin-5/2 fields, on $N$-dimensional ($N \geq 3 $) de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{N}$) are non-unitary unless $N=4$. The (non-)unitarity was demonstrated by simply observing that there is a (mis-)match between the representation-theoretic labels that correspond to the Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIR's) of the de Sitter (dS) algebra spin$(N,1)$ and the ones corresponding to the space of eigenmodes of the field theories. In this paper, we provide a technical representation-theoretic explanation for this fact by studying the (non-)existence of positive-definite, dS invariant scalar products for the spin-3/2 and spin-5/2 strictly/partially massless eigenmodes on $dS_{N}$ ($N \geq 3$). Our basic tool is the examination of the action of spin$(N,1)$ generators on the space of eigenmodes, leading to the following findings. For odd $N$, any dS invariant scalar product is identically zero. For even $N &gt; 4$, any dS invariant scalar product must be indefinite. This gives rise to positive-norm and negative-norm eigenmodes that mix with each other under spin$(N,1)$ boosts. In the $N=4$ case, the positive-norm sector decouples from the negative-norm sector and each sector separately forms a UIR of spin$(4,1)$. Our analysis makes extensive use of the analytic continuation of tensor-spinor spherical harmonics on the $N$-sphere ($S^{N}$) to $dS_{N}$ and also introduces representation-theoretic techniques that are absent from the mathematical physics literature on half-odd-integer-spin fields on $dS_{N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bazhanov--Stroganov (4-simplex) maps are set-theoretical solutions to the 4-simplex equation, namely the fourth member of the family of $n$-simplex equations, which are fundamental equations of mathematical physics. In this paper, we develop a method for constructing Bazhanov--Stroganov maps as extensions of tetrahedron maps which are set-theoretical solutions to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron (3-simplex) equation. We employ this method to construct birarional Bazhanov--Stroganov maps which boil down to the famous electric network and Hirota tetrahedron maps at a certain limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate stationary cKdV systems and prove that every $N$-field stationary cKdV system can be written, after a careful reparametrization of jet variables, as a classical separable St\"ackel system on $N+1$ different ways. For each of these $N+1$ parametrizations we present an explicit map between the jet variables and the separation variables of the system. Finally, we show that each pair of St\"ackel representations of the same stationary cKdV system, when considered in the phase space extended by Casimir variables, is connected by an appropriate finite-dimensional Miura map, which leads to an $(N+1)$-Hamiltonian formulation for the stationary cKdV system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ periodic with respect to a lattice. In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_4+ A_2$ where $\omega_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_6+L$ where $\omega_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L=\mathbb{Z} \times \sqrt{3} \mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</description>

      <title>Prepotential Approach: a unified approach to exactly, quasi-exactly, and rationally extended solvable quantal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of a simple and unified way, called the prepotential approach, to treat both exact and quasi-exact solvabilities of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation. It is based on the prepotential together with Bethe ansatz equations. Unlike the the supersymmetric method for the exactly-solvable systems and the Lie-algebraic approach for the quasi-exactly solvable problems, this approach does not require any knowledge of the underlying symmetry of the system. It treats both quasi-exact and exact solvabilities on the same footing. In this approach the system is completely defined by the choice of two polynomials and a set of Bethe ansatz equations. The potential, the change of variables as well as the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are determined in the same process. We illustrate the approach by several paradigmatic examples of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real energies. Hermitian systems with complex energies, called the quasinormal modes, are also presented. Extension of the approach to the newly discovered rationally extended models is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quest for the golden ratio universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using mode coupling theory the conditions for all allowed dynamical universality classes for the conserved modes in one-dimensional driven systems are presented in closed form as a function of the stationary currents and their derivatives. With a view on the search for the golden ratio universality class the existence of some families of microscopic models is ruled out a priori by using an Onsager-type macroscopic current symmetry. At equal mean densities of the conserved quantities the golden modes can only appear if the currents are antisymmetric under interchange of the conserved densities and if these densities are correlated, but not in the symmetric case where at equal densities one mode is always diffusive and the second may be either Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ), modified KPZ, 3/2-L\'evy, or also diffusive. We also show that the predictions of mode coupling theory for a noisy chain of harmonic oscillators are exact.</description>

      <title>On the space-time fluctuations of the SHE and KPZ equation in the entire $L^{2}$-regime for spatial dimensions $d \geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the mollified stochastic heat equation with flat initial data and the corresponding Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in dimension $d \geq 3$ when the mollification parameter is turned off. In addition, we assume that the strength of the space-time white noise is small enough, such that the solution of the mollified stochastic heat equation has a finite limiting second moment. In this case, with regard to the mollified KPZ equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified KPZ equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional distributions towards a Gaussian free field. On the other hand, about the mollified stochastic heat equation, we show that the fluctuation of the mollified stochastic heat equation about its stationary solution converges in the sense of finite dimensional convergence towards the product of an i.i.d random field and an independent Gaussian free field. Here the i.i.d random field is generated by the limiting partition function of the continuous directed polymer. As an application, we prove the limiting fluctuations of the partition function and the free energy of the continuous directed polymer.</description>

      <title>Signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of complex order-three random tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the signed distribution of the eigenvalues/vectors of the complex order-three random tensor by computing a partition function of a four-fermi theory, where signs are from a Hessian determinant associated to each eigenvector. The issue of the presence of a continuous degeneracy of the eigenvectors is properly treated by a gauge-fixing. The final expression is compactly represented by a generating function, which has an expansion whose powers are the dimensions of the tensor index spaces. A crosscheck is performed by Monte Carlo simulations. By taking the large-$N$ limit we obtain a critical point where the behavior of the signed distribution qualitatively changes, and also the end of the signed distribution. The expected agreement of the end of the signed distribution with that of the genuine distribution provides a few applications, such as the largest eigenvalue, the geometric measure of entanglement, and the best rank-one approximation in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the problem of studing the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky made a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. For higher moments, if one thinks of the ``overlap'' between two subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, as the size of their intersection $j$, then an ultrametric ansatz leads to rigorous lower bounds for the higher moments. For the 3rd moment, the replica symmetric ansatz leads to a complete elliptic integral for the generating function, following a method similar to the diagonal method of Furstenberg, Hautus and Klarner.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>
