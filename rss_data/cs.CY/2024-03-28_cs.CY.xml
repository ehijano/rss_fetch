      <title>Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online user-generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Women are less comfortable expressing opinions online than men and report heightened fears for safety: Surveying gender differences in experiences of online harms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online harms, such as hate speech, trolling and self-harm promotion, continue to be widespread. While some work suggests women are disproportionately affected, other studies find mixed evidence for gender differences in experiences with content of this kind. Using a nationally representative survey of UK adults (N=1992), we examine exposure to a variety of harms, fears surrounding being targeted, the psychological impact of online experiences, the use of safety tools to protect against harm, and comfort with various forms of online participation across men and women. We find that while men and women see harmful content online to a roughly similar extent, women are more at risk than men of being targeted by harms including online misogyny, cyberstalking and cyberflashing. Women are significantly more fearful of being targeted by harms overall, and report greater negative psychological impact as a result of particular experiences. Perhaps in an attempt to mitigate risk, women report higher use of a range of safety tools and less comfort with several forms of online participation, with just 23% of women comfortable expressing political views online compared to 40% of men. We also find direct associations between fears surrounding harms and comfort with online behaviours. For example, fear of being trolled significantly decreases comfort expressing opinions, and fear of being targeted by misogyny significantly decreases comfort sharing photos. Our results are important because with much public discourse happening online, we must ensure all members of society feel safe and able to participate in online spaces.</description>

      <title>Power and Play: Investigating "License to Critique" in Teams' AI Ethics Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past work has sought to design AI ethics interventions-such as checklists or toolkits-to help practitioners design more ethical AI systems. However, other work demonstrates how these interventions and the principles they're based on may serve to instead limit critique to those addressed within the intervention, while rendering broader concerns illegitimate. In this paper, drawing on work examining how standards enact discursive closure and how power relations affect whether and how people raise critique, we recruit three corporate teams, and one activist team, each with prior context working with one another, to play a game designed to trigger broad discussion around AI ethics. We use this as a point of contrast to trigger reflection on their teams' past discussions, examining factors which may affect their "license to critique" in AI ethics discussions. We then report on how particular affordances of this game may influence discussion, and find that the hypothetical context created in the game is unlikely to be a viable mechanism for real world change. We discuss how power dynamics within a group and notions of "scope" affect whether people may be willing to raise critique in AI ethics discussions, and discuss our finding that games are unlikely to enable direct changes to products or practice, but may be more likely to allow members to find critically-aligned allies for future collective action.</description>

      <title>Purposeful remixing with generative AI: Constructing designer voice in multimodal composing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voice, the discursive construction of the writer's identity, has been extensively studied and theorized in composition studies. In multimodal writing, students are able to mobilize both linguistic and non linguistic resources to express their real or imagined identities. But at the same time, when students are limited to choose from available online resources, their voices might be compromised due to the incompatibility between their authorial intentions and the existing materials. This study, therefore, investigates whether the use of generative AI tools could help student authors construct a more consistent voice in multimodal writing. In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflection, written annotation, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices, through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.</description>

      <title>GenAI Detection Tools, Adversarial Techniques and Implications for Inclusivity in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of six major Generative AI (GenAI) text detectors when confronted with machine-generated content that has been modified using techniques designed to evade detection by these tools (n=805). The results demonstrate that the detectors' already low accuracy rates (39.5%) show major reductions in accuracy (17.4%) when faced with manipulated content, with some techniques proving more effective than others in evading detection.
  The accuracy limitations and the potential for false accusations demonstrate that these tools cannot currently be recommended for determining whether violations of academic integrity have occurred, underscoring the challenges educators face in maintaining inclusive and fair assessment practices. However, they may have a role in supporting student learning and maintaining academic integrity when used in a non-punitive manner.
  These results underscore the need for a combined approach to addressing the challenges posed by GenAI in academia to promote the responsible and equitable use of these emerging technologies. The study concludes that the current limitations of AI text detectors require a critical approach for any possible implementation in HE and highlight possible alternatives to AI assessment strategies.</description>

      <title>The use of ChatGPT in higher education: The advantages and disadvantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher education scholars are interested in an artificial intelligence (AI) technology called ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI. Whether ChatGPT can improve learning is still a topic of debate among experts. This concise overview of the literature examines the application of ChatGPT in higher education to comprehend and produce high-level instruction. By examining the essential literature, this study seeks to provide a thorough assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing ChatGPT in higher education settings. But it's crucial to consider both the positive and negative elements. For this rapid review, the researcher searched Google Scholar, Scopus, and others between January 2023 and July 2023 for prior research from various publications. These studies were examined. The study found that employing ChatGPT in higher education is beneficial for a number of reasons. It can provide individualized instruction, and prompt feedback, facilitate access to learning, and promote student interaction. These benefits could improve the learning environment and make it more fun for academics and students. The cons of ChatGPT are equally present. These problems include the inability to comprehend emotions, the lack of social interaction chances, technological limitations, and the dangers of depending too much on ChatGPT for higher education. Higher education should combine ChatGPT with other teaching techniques to provide students and lecturers with a comprehensive education. However, it is crucial to consider the positives, negatives, and moral issues before adopting ChatGPT in the classroom.</description>

      <title>Developing generative AI chatbots conceptual framework for higher education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores the quickly changing field of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) chatbots in higher education, an industry that is undergoing major technological changes. AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, HuggingChat, and Google Bard, are becoming more and more common in a variety of sectors, including education. Their acceptance is still in its early phases, with a variety of prospects and obstacles. However, their potential in higher education is particularly noteworthy, providing lecturers and students with affordable, individualized support. Creating a comprehensive framework to aid the usage of generative AI chatbots in higher education institutions (HEIs) is the aim of this project. The Chukwuere Generative AI Chatbots Acceptance Model (CGAICAM) is the result of this study's synthesis of elements from well-known frameworks, including the TAM, UTAUT2, TPB, and others along with variables like optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, insecurity, and others. Using a research method that encompasses a comprehensive analysis of extant literature from databases such as IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, the study aims to comprehend the implications of AI Chatbots on higher education and pinpoint critical elements for their efficacious implementation. Peer-reviewed English-language publications published between 2020 and 2023 with a focus on the use of AI chatbots in higher education were the main focus of the search criteria. The results demonstrate how much AI chatbots can do to improve student engagement, streamline the educational process, and support administrative and research duties. But there are also clear difficulties, such as unfavorable student sentiments, doubts about the veracity of material produced by AI, and unease and nervousness with new technologies.</description>

      <title>Cycling on the Freeway: The Perilous State of Open Source Neuroscience Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020; Carver et al., 2022; Hettrick, 2014; Hettrick et al., 2014; Switters and Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain - or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years there has been a shift toward relying on free, open-source scientific software (FOSSS) for neuroscience data analysis (Poldrack et al., 2019), in line with the broader open science movement in academia (McKiernan et al., 2016) and wider industry trends (Eghbal, 2016). Importantly, FOSSS is typically developed by working scientists (not professional software developers) which sets up a precarious situation given the nature of the typical academic workplace (wherein academics, especially in their early careers, are on short and fixed term contracts). In this paper, we will argue that the existing ecosystem of neuroscientific open source software is brittle, and discuss why and how the neuroscience community needs to come together to ensure a healthy growth of our software landscape to the benefit of all.</description>

      <title>Real-time accident detection and physiological signal monitoring to enhance motorbike safety and emergency response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization and improved living standards have led to a substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the road, consequently resulting in a rise in the frequency of accidents. Among these accidents, motorbike accidents pose a particularly high risk, often resulting in serious injuries or deaths. A significant number of these fatalities occur due to delayed or inadequate medical attention. To this end, we propose a novel automatic detection and notification system specifically designed for motorbike accidents. The proposed system comprises two key components: a detection system and a physiological signal monitoring system. The detection system is integrated into the helmet and consists of a microcontroller, accelerometer, GPS, GSM, and Wi-Fi modules. The physio-monitoring system incorporates a sensor for monitoring pulse rate and SpO$_{2}$ saturation. All collected data are presented on an LCD display and wirelessly transmitted to the detection system through the microcontroller of the physiological signal monitoring system. If the accelerometer readings consistently deviate from the specified threshold decided through extensive experimentation, the system identifies the event as an accident and transmits the victim's information -- including the GPS location, pulse rate, and SpO$_{2}$ saturation rate -- to the designated emergency contacts. Preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system in accurately detecting motorbike accidents and promptly alerting emergency contacts. We firmly believe that the proposed system has the potential to significantly mitigate the risks associated with motorbike accidents and save lives.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Fair Feature Selection in Machine Learning for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the universal adoption of machine learning in healthcare, the potential for the automation of societal biases to further exacerbate health disparities poses a significant risk. We explore algorithmic fairness from the perspective of feature selection. Traditional feature selection methods identify features for better decision making by removing resource-intensive, correlated, or non-relevant features but overlook how these factors may differ across subgroups. To counter these issues, we evaluate a fair feature selection method that considers equal importance to all demographic groups. We jointly considered a fairness metric and an error metric within the feature selection process to ensure a balance between minimizing both bias and global classification error. We tested our approach on three publicly available healthcare datasets. On all three datasets, we observed improvements in fairness metrics coupled with a minimal degradation of balanced accuracy. Our approach addresses both distributive and procedural fairness within the fair machine learning context.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Ranking: Robustness through Randomization without the Protected Attribute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been great interest in fairness in machine learning, especially in relation to classification problems. In ranking-related problems, such as in online advertising, recommender systems, and HR automation, much work on fairness remains to be done. Two complications arise: first, the protected attribute may not be available in many applications. Second, there are multiple measures of fairness of rankings, and optimization-based methods utilizing a single measure of fairness of rankings may produce rankings that are unfair with respect to other measures. In this work, we propose a randomized method for post-processing rankings, which do not require the availability of the protected attribute. In an extensive numerical study, we show the robustness of our methods with respect to P-Fairness and effectiveness with respect to Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) from the baseline ranking, improving on previously proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Narratives of Collective Action in YouTube's Discourse on Veganism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narratives can be powerful tools for inspiring action on pressing societal issues such as climate change. While social science theories offer frameworks for understanding the narratives that arise within collective movements, these are rarely applied to the vast data available from social media platforms, which play a significant role in shaping public opinion and mobilizing collective action. This gap in the empirical evaluation of online narratives limits our understanding of their relationship with public response. In this study, we focus on plant-based diets as a form of pro-environmental action and employ natural language processing to operationalize a theoretical framework of moral narratives specific to the vegan movement. We apply this framework to narratives found in YouTube videos promoting environmental initiatives such as Veganuary, Meatless March, and No Meat May. Our analysis reveals that several narrative types, as defined by the theory, are empirically present in the data. To identify narratives with the potential to elicit positive public engagement, we used text processing to estimate the proportion of comments supporting collective action across narrative types. Video narratives advocating social fight, whether through protest or through efforts to convert others to the cause, are associated with a stronger sense of collective action in the respective comments. These narrative types also demonstrate increased semantic coherence and alignment between the message and public response, markers typically associated with successful collective action. Our work offers new insights into the complex factors that influence the emergence of collective action, thereby informing the development of effective communication strategies within social movements.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Communities: Exploring Academic References on Stack Overflow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stack Overflow is widely recognized by software practitioners as the go-to resource for addressing technical issues and sharing practical solutions. While not typically seen as a scholarly forum, users on Stack Overflow commonly refer to academic sources in their discussions. Yet, little is known about these referenced academic works and how they intersect the needs and interests of the Stack Overflow community. To bridge this gap, we conducted an exploratory large-scale study on the landscape of academic references in Stack Overflow. Our findings reveal that Stack Overflow communities with different domains of interest engage with academic literature at varying frequencies and speeds. The contradicting patterns suggest that some disciplines may have diverged in their interests and development trajectories from the corresponding practitioner community. Finally, we discuss the potential of Stack Overflow in gauging the real-world relevance of academic research.</description>

      <title>Trust in AI: Progress, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in our daily life through various applications, services, and products explains the significance of trust/distrust in AI from a user perspective. AI-driven systems (as opposed to other technologies) have ubiquitously diffused in our life not only as some beneficial tools to be used by human agents but also are going to be substitutive agents on our behalf, or manipulative minds that would influence human thought, decision, and agency. Trust/distrust in AI plays the role of a regulator and could significantly control the level of this diffusion, as trust can increase, and distrust may reduce the rate of adoption of AI. Recently, varieties of studies have paid attention to the variant dimension of trust/distrust in AI, and its relevant considerations. In this systematic literature review, after conceptualization of trust in the current AI literature review, we will investigate trust in different types of human-Machine interaction, and its impact on technology acceptance in different domains. In addition to that, we propose a taxonomy of technical (i.e., safety, accuracy, robustness) and non-technical axiological (i.e., ethical, legal, and mixed) trustworthiness metrics, and some trustworthy measurements. Moreover, we examine some major trust-breakers in AI (e.g., autonomy and dignity threat), and trust makers; and propose some future directions and probable solutions for the transition to a trustworthy AI.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven optimization models have the potential to significantly improve hospital capacity management, particularly during demand surges, when effective allocation of capacity is most critical and challenging. However, integrating models into existing processes in a way that provides value requires recognizing that hospital administrators are ultimately responsible for making capacity management decisions, and carefully building trustworthy and accessible tools for them. In this study, we develop an interactive, user-friendly, electronic dashboard for informing hospital capacity management decisions during surge periods. The dashboard integrates real-time hospital data, predictive analytics, and optimization models. It allows hospital administrators to interactively customize parameters, enabling them to explore a range of scenarios, and provides real-time updates on recommended optimal decisions. The dashboard was created through a participatory design process, involving hospital administrators in the development team to ensure practical utility, trustworthiness, transparency, explainability, and usability. We successfully deployed our dashboard within the Johns Hopkins Health System during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the increased need for tools to inform hospital capacity management. It was used on a daily basis, with results regularly communicated to hospital leadership. This study demonstrates the practical application of a prospective, data-driven, interactive decision-support tool for hospital system capacity management.</description>

Abstract: The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is focusing on creating automated decision-making (ADM) systems that operate as close as possible to human-like intelligence. This effort has pushed AI researchers into exploring cognitive fields like psychology. The work of Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky on biased human decision-making, including the study of the conjunction fallacy, has experienced a second revival because of this. Under the conjunction fallacy a human decision-maker will go against basic probability laws and rank as more likely a conjunction over one of its parts. It has been proven overtime through a set of experiments with the Linda Problem being the most famous one. Although this interdisciplinary effort is welcomed, we fear that AI researchers ignore the driving force behind the conjunction fallacy as captured by the Linda Problem: the fact that Linda must be stereotypically described as a woman. In this paper we revisit the Linda Problem and formulate it as a fairness problem. In doing so we introduce perception as a parameter of interest through the structural causal perception framework. Using an illustrative decision-making example, we showcase the proposed conceptual framework and its potential impact for developing fair ADM systems.</description>
