      <title>Observation and spectroscopy of proton-unbound nucleus $^{21}$Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of previously-unknown isotope $^{21}$Al, the first unbound aluminum isotope located beyond the proton dripline. The $^{21}$Al nucleus decays by one-proton (1p) emission, and its in-flight decays were detected by tracking trajectories of all decay products with micro-strip silicon detectors. The 1p-emission processes were studied by analyses of the measured angular correlations of decay products $^{20}$Mg+p. The 1p-decay energies of ground and low-lying excited states of $^{21}$Al, its mass excess and proton separation energy value $S_p$=$-1.1(1)$ MeV were determined.</description>

      <title>Proton 3D reconstruction with T-odd TMD gluon densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present studies aimed at probing the 3D gluon content of the proton through spin-dependent TMD gluon densities, computed by means of the spectator-model approach. Our formalism incorporates a fit-based modulation function for the spectator mass, designed to capture longitudinal-momentum effects across a broad kinematic range. Special emphasis is placed on the time-reversal even Boer-Mulders and the time-reversal odd Sivers functions. Accurate understanding of these functions is crucial for conducting precise 3D analyses of nucleons, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts between the LHC and EIC Communities.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Measurement of inclusive charged-particle jet production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurements of inclusive charged-particle jet production in pp and p-Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV and the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}^{\rm ch\,jet}$ are presented, using data collected with the ALICE detector at the LHC. Jets are reconstructed in the central rapidity region $|\eta_{\rm jet}| &lt; 0.5$ from charged particles using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm with resolution parameters $R = 0.2$, 0.3, and 0.4. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential inclusive production cross section of charged-particle jets, as well as the corresponding cross section ratios, are reported for pp and p-Pb collisions in the transverse momentum range $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 140$ GeV/$c$ and $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 160$ GeV/$c$, respectively, together with the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}^{\rm ch\,jet}$ in the range $10 &lt; p^{\rm ch}_{\rm T,jet} &lt; 140$ GeV/$c$. The analysis extends the $p_{\rm T}$ range of the previously-reported charged-particle jet measurements by the ALICE Collaboration. The nuclear modification factor is found to be consistent with one and independent of the jet resolution parameter with the improved precision of this study, indicating that the possible influence of cold nuclear matter effects on the production cross section of charged-particle jets in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is smaller than the current precision. The obtained results are in agreement with other minimum bias jet measurements available for RHIC and LHC energies, and are well reproduced by the NLO perturbative QCD POWHEG calculations with parton shower provided by PYTHIA8 as well as by JETSCAPE simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity-dependent production of $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production yields of the $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ resonances are measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with ALICE. The measurements are performed as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity $\langle \mathrm{d}N_\mathrm{ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta \rangle$, which is related to the energy density produced in the collision. The results include transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions, $p_{\rm T}$-integrated yields, mean transverse momenta of $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$, as well as ratios of the $p_{\rm T}$-integrated resonance yields relative to yields of other hadron species. The $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}/\pi^{\pm}$ yield ratios are consistent with the trend of the enhancement of strangeness production from low to high multiplicity pp collisions, which was previously observed for strange and multi-strange baryons. The yield ratio between the measured resonances and the long-lived baryons with the same strangeness content exhibits a hint of a mild increasing trend at low multiplicity, despite too large uncertainties to exclude the flat behaviour. The results are compared with predictions from models such as EPOS-LHC and PYTHIA 8 with Rope shoving. The latter provides the best description of the multiplicity dependence of the $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic correlations of identical charged pions and kaons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with event-shape selection</title>

Abstract: Collective behavior has been observed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions for several decades. Collectivity is driven by the high particle multiplicities that are produced in these collisions. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), features of collectivity have also been seen in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions that can attain particle multiplicities comparable to peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. One of the possible signatures of collective behavior is the decrease of femtoscopic radii extracted from pion and kaon pairs emitted from high-multiplicity collisions with increasing pair transverse momentum. This decrease can be described in terms of an approximate transverse mass scaling. In the present work, femtoscopic analyses are carried out by the ALICE Collaboration on charged pion and kaon pairs produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV from the LHC to study possible collectivity in pp collisions. The event-shape analysis method based on transverse sphericity is used to select for spherical versus jet-like events, and the effects of this selection on the femtoscopic radii for both charged pion and kaon pairs are studied. This is the first time this selection method has been applied to charged kaon pairs. An approximate transverse-mass scaling of the radii is found in all multiplicity ranges studied when the difference in the Lorentz boost for pions and kaons is taken into account. This observation does not support the hypothesis of collective expansion of hot and dense matter that should only occur in high-multiplicity events. A possible alternate explanation of the present results is based on a scenario of common emission conditions for pions and kaons in pp collisions for the multiplicity ranges studied.</description>

      <title>Observation of abnormal suppression of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production on the final-state charged-particle multiplicity in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV is reported. The production of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured with the ALICE detector via the $\mathrm{f}_0 (980) \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel in a midrapidity region of $-0.5&lt;y&lt;0$. Particle yield ratios of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) to $\pi$ and $\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ are found to be decreasing with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. The magnitude of the suppression of the $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980)/$\pi$ and $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980)/$\mathrm{K}^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ yield ratios is found to be dependent on the transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, suggesting different mechanisms responsible for the measured effects. Furthermore, the nuclear modification factor $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) is measured in various multiplicity ranges. The $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ shows a strong suppression of the $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) production in the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ region up to about 4 GeV/$c$. The results on the particle yield ratios and $Q_{\mathrm{pPb}}$ for $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) may help to understand the late hadronic phase in p$-$Pb collisions and the nature of the internal structure of $\mathrm{f}_{0}$(980) particle.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs in ultra-peripheral collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs may be produced in photonuclear collisions, either from the decays of photoproduced $\phi (1020)$ mesons, or directly as non-resonant K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs. Measurements of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction probe the couplings between the $\phi (1020)$ and charged kaons with photons and nuclear targets. The kaon$-$proton scattering occurs at energies far above those available elsewhere. We present the first measurement of coherent photoproduction of K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ pairs on lead ions in ultra-peripheral collisions using the ALICE detector, including the first investigation of direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ production. There is significant K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ production at low transverse momentum, consistent with coherent photoproduction on lead targets. In the mass range $1.1 &lt; M_{\rm{KK}} &lt; 1.4$ GeV/$c^2$ above the $\phi (1020)$ resonance, for rapidity $|y_{\rm{KK}}|&lt;0.8$ and $p_{\rm T,KK} &lt; 0.1$ GeV/$c$, the measured coherent photoproduction cross section is $\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}y$ = 3.37 $\pm\ 0.61$ (stat.) $\pm\ 0.15 $ (syst.) mb. The center-of-mass energy per nucleon of the photon-nucleus (Pb) system $W_{\gamma \mathrm{Pb, n}}$ ranges from 33 to 188 GeV, far higher than previous measurements on heavy-nucleus targets. The cross section is larger than expected for $\phi (1020)$ photoproduction alone. The mass spectrum is fit to a cocktail consisting of $\phi (1020)$ decays, direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction, and interference between the two. The confidence regions for the amplitude and relative phase angle for direct K$^{+}$K$^{-}$ photoproduction are presented.</description>

      <title>Emergence of long-range angular correlations in low-multiplicity proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents the measurement of near-side associated per-trigger yields, denoted ridge yields, from the analysis of angular correlations of charged hadrons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Long-range ridge yields are extracted for pairs of charged particles with a pseudorapidity difference of $1.4 &lt; |\Delta\eta| &lt; 1.8$ and a transverse momentum of $1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 2$ GeV/$c$, as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity measured at midrapidity. This study extends the measurements of the ridge yield to the low multiplicity region, where in hadronic collisions it is typically conjectured that a strongly-interacting medium is unlikely to be formed. The precision of the new low multiplicity results allows for the first direct quantitative comparison with the results obtained in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 91 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 183$-$209 GeV, where initial-state effects such as pre-equilibrium dynamics and collision geometry are not expected to play a role. In the multiplicity range $8\lesssim\langle N_\mathrm{ch}\rangle\lesssim 24$ where the $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ results have good precision, the measured ridge yields in pp collisions are substantially larger than the limits set in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ annihilations. Consequently, the findings presented in this Letter suggest that the processes involved in $\mathrm {e^{+}e^{-}}$ annihilations do not contribute significantly to the emergence of long-range correlations in pp collisions.</description>

Abstract: A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) has been conceived and constructed as a heavy-ion experiment at the LHC. During LHC Runs 1 and 2, it has produced a wide range of physics results using all collision systems available at the LHC. In order to best exploit new physics opportunities opening up with the upgraded LHC and new detector technologies, the experiment has undergone a major upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (2019-2022). This comprises the move to continuous readout, the complete overhaul of core detectors, as well as a new online event processing farm with a redesigned online-offline software framework. These improvements will allow to record Pb-Pb collisions at rates up to 50 kHz, while ensuring sensitivity for signals without a triggerable signature.</description>

      <title>Search for jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV via di-jet acoplanarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration reports a search for jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity (HM) proton$-$proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, using the semi-inclusive azimuthal-difference distribution $\Delta\varphi$ of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum (high-$p_{\mathrm{T,trig}}$) trigger hadron. Jet quenching may broaden the $\Delta\varphi$ distribution measured in HM events compared to that in minimum bias (MB) events. The measurement employs a $p_{\mathrm{T,trig}}$-differential observable for data-driven suppression of the contribution of multiple partonic interactions, which is the dominant background. While azimuthal broadening is indeed observed in HM compared to MB events, similar broadening for HM events is observed for simulations based on the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo generator, which does not incorporate jet quenching. Detailed analysis of these data and simulations show that the azimuthal broadening is due to bias of the HM selection towards events with multiple jets in the final state. The identification of this bias has implications for all jet quenching searches where selection is made on the event activity.</description>

      <title>Light-flavor particle production in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}} = 13}$ TeV as a function of transverse spherocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Results on the transverse spherocity dependence of light-flavor particle production ($\pi$, K, p, $\phi$, ${\rm K^{*0}}$, ${\rm K}^{0}_{\rm{S}}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$) at midrapidity in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV were obtained with the ALICE apparatus. The transverse spherocity estimator ($S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$) categorizes events by their azimuthal topology. Utilizing narrow selections on $S_{\text{O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$, it is possible to contrast particle production in collisions dominated by many soft initial interactions with that observed in collisions dominated by one or more hard scatterings. Results are reported for two multiplicity estimators covering different pseudorapidity regions. The $S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$ estimator is found to effectively constrain the hardness of the events when the midrapidity ($\left | \eta \right |&lt; 0.8$) estimator is used. The production rates of strange particles are found to be slightly higher for soft isotropic topologies, and severely suppressed in hard jet-like topologies. These effects are more pronounced for hadrons with larger mass and strangeness content, and observed when the topological selection is done within a narrow multiplicity interval. This demonstrates that an important aspect of the universal scaling of strangeness enhancement with final-state multiplicity is that high-multiplicity collisions are dominated by soft, isotropic processes. On the contrary, strangeness production in events with jet-like processes is significantly reduced. The results presented in this article are compared with several QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators. Models that incorporate a two-component phenomenology, either through mechanisms accounting for string density, or thermal production, are able to describe the observed strangeness enhancement as a function of $S_{{\rm O}}^{{\it p}_{\rm T}=1}$.</description>

Abstract: The proton-induced deuteron knockout reaction, ($p$,$pd$), is one of the interests in the studies for probing the deuteron-like $p$-$n$ correlation in nuclei. According to a recent study of the inclusive deuteron-induced reaction, $(d,d'x)$, the refraction effect of the deuteron has a significant effect on the elementary process, nucleon-deuteron ($N$-$d$) binary scattering inside a nucleus, of the reaction. In the paper, it is shown that proper treatment of the local $N$-$d$ relative momentum in the elementary process is crucial in $(d,d'x)$ reactions at $100$ MeV and below. In the present work, we investigate the deuteron refraction effect in the exclusive ($p$,$pd$) reactions. We also discuss the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. The refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process is taken into account by the local semiclassical approximation to the distorted waves. The results are compared with those obtained with the asymptotic momentum approximation, which is standardly applied to the distorted wave impulse approximation framework. It is shown that the refraction effect drastically changes the energy sharing distribution of the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and gives a better agreement with experimental data. In contrast, it is confirmed that the effect is negligibly small at 250 MeV. We have clarified that the deuteron refraction effect is significant in the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and the experimental data are well reproduced. The refraction effect plays a significant role in both the shape and magnitude of the ($p$,$pd$) cross section, while the effect is negligible at 250 MeV.</description>
