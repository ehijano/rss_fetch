      <title>Bridging the Digital Divide: Mapping Internet Connectivity Evolution, Inequalities, and Resilience in six Brazilian Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of Internet speed and its implications for access to key digital services, as well as the resilience of the network during crises, focusing on six major Brazilian cities: Belo Horizonte, Bras\'ilia, Fortaleza, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, and S\~ao Paulo. Leveraging a unique dataset of Internet Speedtest results provided by Ookla, we analyze Internet speed trends from 2017 to 2023. Our findings reveal significant improvements in Internet speed across all cities. However, we find that prosperous areas generally exhibit better Internet access, and that the dependence of Internet quality on wealth have increased over time. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Internet quality on access to critical online services, focusing on e-learning. Our analysis shows that nearly 13% of catchment areas around educational facilities have Internet speeds below the threshold required for e-learning, with less rich areas experiencing more significant challenges. Moreover, we investigate the network's resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, finding a sharp decline in network quality following the declaration of national emergency. We also find that less wealthy areas experience larger drops in network quality during crises. Overall, this study underscores the importance of addressing disparities in Internet access to ensure equitable access to digital services and enhance network resilience during crises</description>

      <title>Structural prediction of super-diffusion in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion dynamics in multiplex networks can model a diverse number of real-world processes. In some specific configurations of these systems, the super-diffusion phenomenon arises, in which the diffusion is faster in the multiplex network than in any of its layers. Many studies attempt to characterize this phenomenon by examining its dependency on structural properties of the network, such as overlap, average degree, network dissimilarity, and others. While certain properties show a correlation with super-diffusion in specific networks, a broader characterization is still missing. Here, we introduce a structural parameter based on the minimum node strength that effectively predicts the occurrence of super-diffusion in multiplex networks. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for deriving analytical bounds for several multiplex networks structures. Finally, we analyze and justify why certain arrangements of the inter-layer connections induce super-diffusion. These findings provide novel insights into the super-diffusion phenomenon and the interplay between network structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Election Polls on Social Media: Prevalence, Biases, and Voter Fraud Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11146v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms allow users to create polls to gather public opinion on diverse topics. However, we know little about what such polls are used for and how reliable they are, especially in significant contexts like elections. Focusing on the 2020 presidential elections in the U.S., this study shows that outcomes of election polls on Twitter deviate from election results despite their prevalence. Leveraging demographic inference and statistical analysis, we find that Twitter polls are disproportionately authored by older males and exhibit a large bias towards candidate Donald Trump relative to representative mainstream polls. We investigate potential sources of biased outcomes from the point of view of inauthentic, automated, and counter-normative behavior. Using social media experiments and interviews with poll authors, we identify inconsistencies between public vote counts and those privately visible to poll authors, with the gap potentially attributable to purchased votes. We also find that Twitter accounts participating in election polls are more likely to be bots, and election poll outcomes tend to be more biased, before the election day than after. Finally, we identify instances of polls spreading voter fraud conspiracy theories and estimate that a couple thousand of such polls were posted in 2020. The study discusses the implications of biased election polls in the context of transparency and accountability of social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of General Impulsive VS-EIAR Epidemic Models with Application to Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in a VS-EIAR epidemiological model considering vaccinated individuals ${V_i: i=1,\ldots,n}$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}^{*}$. The dynamic of the VS-EIAR model involves several ordinary differential equations that describe the changes in the vaccinated, susceptible, infected, exposed, asymptomatic, and deceased population groups. Our aim is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, infected, and asymptomatic individuals by administering vaccination doses to susceptible individuals and treatment to infected population. To achieve this, we utilize optimal control theory to regulate the dynamic of our considered epidemic model within a terminal optimal time $\tau^{*}$. Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) will be employed to establish the existence of an optimal control time $(v^{*}(t), u^{*}(t))$. We also incorporate an impulsive VS-EIAR epidemic model, with special attention given to immigration or the travel of certain population groups. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation to demonstrate the practical implementation of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Random hyperbolic graphs in $d+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.12303v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random hyperbolic graphs in hyperbolic spaces of any dimension $d+1\geq 2$. We present a rescaling of model parameters that casts the random hyperbolic graph model of any dimension to a unified mathematical framework, leaving the degree distribution invariant with respect to the dimension. Unlike the degree distribution, clustering does depend on the dimension, decreasing to 0 at $d \rightarrow \infty$. We analyze all of the other limiting regimes of the model, and we release a software package that generates random hyperbolic graphs and their limits in hyperbolic spaces of any dimension.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Crowd Egress with Environmental Stressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01393v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a modeling framework to characterize evacuee response to environmental stimuli during emergency egress. The model is developed in consistency with stress theory, which explains how an organism reacts to environmental stressors. We integrate the theory into the well-known social-force model, and develop a framework to simulate crowd evacuation behavior in multi-compartment buildings. Our method serves as a theoretical basis to study crowd movement at bottlenecks, and simulate their herding and way-finding behavior in normal and hazardous conditions. The pre-movement behavior is also briefly investigated by using opinion dynamics with social group model. The algorithms have been partly tested in FDS+EVAC as well as our simulation platform crowdEgress.</description>

      <title>Correlation distances in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore degree assortativity in complex networks, and extend its usual definition beyond that of nearest neighbours. We apply this definition to model networks, and describe a rewiring algorithm that induces assortativity. We compare these results to real networks. Social networks in particular tend to be assortatively mixed by degree in contrast to many other types of complex networks. However, we show here that these positive correlations diminish after one step and in most of the empirical networks analysed. Properties besides degree support this, such as the number of papers in scientific coauthorship networks, with no correlations beyond nearest neighbours. Beyond next-nearest neighbours we also observe a diasassortative tendency for nodes three steps away indicating that nodes at that distance are more likely different than similar.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Benefit of Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has the potential to change almost every line of work. As AI capabilities continue to improve in accuracy, robustness, and reach, AI may outperform and even replace human experts across many valuable tasks. Despite enormous effort devoted to understanding the impact of AI on labor and the economy and AI's recent successes in accelerating scientific discovery and progress, we lack a systematic understanding of how AI advances may benefit scientific research across disciplines and fields. Here, drawing from the literature on the future of work and the science of science, we develop a measurement framework to estimate both the direct use of AI and the potential benefit of AI in scientific research, applying natural language processing techniques to 74.6 million publications and 7.1 million patents. We find that the use of AI in research is widespread throughout the sciences, growing especially rapidly since 2015, and papers that use AI exhibit a citation premium, more likely to be highly cited both within and outside their disciplines. Moreover, our analysis reveals considerable potential for AI to benefit numerous scientific fields, yet a notable disconnect exists between AI education and its research applications, highlighting a mismatch between the supply of AI expertise and its demand in research. Lastly, we examine demographic disparities in AI's benefits across scientific disciplines and find that disciplines with a higher proportion of women or Black scientists tend to be associated with less benefit, suggesting that AI's growing impact on research may further exacerbate existing inequalities in science. As the connection between AI and scientific research deepens, our findings may become increasingly important, with implications for the equity and sustainability of the research enterprise.</description>
