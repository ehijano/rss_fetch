      <title>A Case Study on Modeling Adequacy of a Grid with Subsynchronous Oscillations Involving IBRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A case study on modeling adequacy of a grid in presence of renewable resources based on grid-forming converters (GFCs) is the subject matter of this paper. For this purpose, a 4-machine 11-bus IEEE benchmark model is modified by considering GFCs replacing synchronous generators that led to unstable subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs). We aim to: (a) understand if transmission network dynamics should be considered in such cases, (b) revisit the space-phasor-calculus (SPC) in d-q frame under balanced condition that captures such phenomena and lends itself to eigenvalue analysis, and (c) emphasize limitations of such models while underscoring their importance for large-scale power system simulations. Time-domain and frequency-domain results from SPC and quasistationary phasor calculus (QPC) models are compared with electromagnetic transient (EMT)-based simulations. It is shown that models with transmission line dynamics in SPC framework can capture the SSO mode while QPC models that neglect these dynamics fail to do so.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature has proposed approaches that learn control policies with high performance while maintaining safety guarantees. Synthesizing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachable sets has become an effective tool for verifying safety and supervising the training of reinforcement learning-based control policies for complex, high-dimensional systems. Previously, HJ reachability was limited to verifying low-dimensional dynamical systems -- this is because the computational complexity of the dynamic programming approach it relied on grows exponentially with the number of system states. To address this limitation, in recent years, there have been methods that compute the reachability value function simultaneously with learning control policies to scale HJ reachability analysis while still maintaining a reliable estimate of the true reachable set. These HJ reachability approximations are used to improve the safety, and even reward performance, of learned control policies and can solve challenging tasks such as those with dynamic obstacles and/or with lidar-based or vision-based observations. In this survey paper, we review the recent developments in the field of HJ reachability estimation in reinforcement learning that would provide a foundational basis for further research into reliability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Provider Resource Scheduling in Massive MIMO Radio Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect of 5G networks is the development of Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing, a concept wherein the virtualized infrastructure of wireless networks is subdivided into slices (or enterprises), tailored to fulfill specific use-cases. A key focus in this context is the efficient radio resource allocation to meet various enterprises' service-level agreements (SLAs). In this work, we introduce a channel-aware and SLA-aware RAN slicing framework for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) networks where resource allocation extends to incorporate the spatial dimension available through beamforming. Essentially, the same time-frequency resource block (RB) can be shared across multiple users through multiple antennas. Notably, certain enterprises, particularly those operating critical infrastructure, necessitate dedicated RB allocation, denoted as private networks, to ensure security. Conversely, some enterprises would allow resource sharing with others in the public network to maintain network performance while minimizing capital expenditure. Building upon this understanding, the proposed scheduler comprises scheduling schemes under both scenarios: where different slices share the same set of RBs, and where they require exclusivity of allocated RBs. We validate the efficacy of our proposed schedulers through simulation by utilizing a channel data set collected from a real-world massive MIMO testbed. Our assessments demonstrate that resource sharing across slices using our approach can lead up to 60.9% reduction in RB usage compared to other approaches. Moreover, our proposed schedulers exhibit significantly enhanced operational efficiency, with significantly faster running time compared to exhaustive greedy approaches while meeting the stringent 5G sub-millisecond-level latency requirement.</description>

      <title>Temperature Secret in Bathtub A Model of Temperature Distribution of Bathtub Based on Heat Conduction Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the multidimensional heat conduction and heat transfer equations to model the temperature distribution of water in a bathtub by solving partial differential equations. We address optimal water addition and bathtub design. First, we establish a water surface cooling model using Newton's law of cooling to simulate heat exchange between air and water. Without new heat sources, the water temperature reaches a minimum in 40 minutes. We then simulate adding hot water with a one-dimensional heat conduction model, including air cooling effects. We determine that the optimal heat input is 80 Joules and the optimal water velocity is 0.042 m/s to maintain temperature and save water. The ideal bathtub dimensions are 1.5m length, 0.6m width, 0.42m depth, with rounded corners. Using finite difference methods and MATLAB's Pdetool, we solve the heat conduction equation and verify numerical stability, discussing the model's pros and cons and suggesting improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a gravity balanced arm exoskeleton design for basketball shooting training. The potential energy equation of the mechanism is derived. A simulation of the arm going through the basketball shooting motion is done on the mechanism. Throughout the motion the total potential energy is constant. Thus, the proposed arm exoskeleton is indeed gravity balanced with the use of two springs.</description>

      <title>Power System Architecture and Control for Green Hydrogen Production via Power Converter-less Photovoltaic-Electrolyser Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a power system architecture and control for efficient and low-cost green hydrogen production. The proposed system integrates photovoltaic (PV) sources directly with an electrolyser stack, thereby eliminating the need for traditional power converters. With the removal of traditional power converters, maximum power point tracking is achieved through dynamic switching of electrolyser cells in the stack, enabling load variation to maintain optimal voltage for maximum power output. The demonstration methodology involves comprehensive MATLAB Simulink analysis of the integrated system performance through controlled PV-electrolyser interactions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Benchmarking of Energy-saving Sub-Optimal Sliding Mode Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced energy-saving extension of the sub-optimal sliding mode control allows for the control-off phases during convergence to the second-order equilibrium. It enables, this way, a lower energy consumption comparing to the original sub-optimal sliding mode (SM) algorithm, for the commutating discontinuous control signal. In this paper, the energy-saving sub-optimal SM control is experimentally benchmarked against a standard second-order SM controller which has also discontinuous control action. Here the so-called terminal second-order SM algorithm is used. The system plant is affected by the matched bounded disturbances which are unknown, and the output is subject to the sensing noise. Also, a first-order actuator dynamics can lead to an additional chattering in SM applications. For a fair comparison, the same (quadratic) terminal surface is designed when benchmarking both SM controllers. Moreover, the experimentally compared SM algorithms share the same amplitude and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented State Information Compression for Linear Dynamical System Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider controlled linear dynamical systems in which the controller has only access to a compressed version of the system state. The technical problem we investigate is that of allocating compression resources over time such that the control performance degradation induced by compression is minimized. This can be formulated as an optimization problem to find the optimal resource allocation policy. Under mild assumptions, this optimization problem can be proved to have the same well-known structure as in [1], allowing the optimal resource allocation policy to be determined in closed-form. The obtained insights behind the optimal policy provide clear guidelines on the issue of "when to communicate" and "how to communicate" in dynamical systems with restricted communication resources. The obtained simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed allocation policy and illustrate the gain over the widely used uniform rate allocation policy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Two-Track Model of a Semitrailer with Experimental Validation of Lateral and Vertical Tire Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the automation of commercial vehicles, the number of assistance systems in this field is continuously increasing. The semitrailer plays an important role for the vehicles driving dynamics due to its highly varying loads and the large proportion to the total mass of the truck-semitrailer, especially when it is fully loaded. To create a basis for further development of assistance systems for the semitrailer, this paper presents a two-track model which includes the lateral and roll dynamics of the semitrailer. This enables the future development of observer and filter-based estimation of vehicle states and parameters, which are impossible or very difficult to measure. For offline identification of the unknown model parameters, a Particle-Swarm-Optimization (PSO) algorithm will be used. The validation of the model is based on measurements from a test vehicle. The focus is on the lateral and vertical tire forces of the semitrailer, which are measured at the test vehicle using strain gauges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of energy deficiencies and high impact low probability (HILP) events in modern electrical grids by developing resilient microgrid energy management strategies. It introduces a sliding Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology integrated with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), emphasizing extending battery life and prioritizing critical loads during HILP events. This approach focuses on extending the sustainability of battery operation by linearizing the battery lifecycle within the optimization framework. Furthermore, this research proposed a straightforward method to mitigate communication disruptions during HILP events, thereby ensuring operational integrity. This focused approach enhances isolated microgrid resilience and sustainability, offering a strategic response to contemporary environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Distributed Charging Coordination for Electric Trucks under Limited Facilities and Travel Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks' nontrivial charging times and the stations' limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks' waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks' operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for $1,000$ trucks traversing the Swedish road network for $40$ days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by $46.1\%$ compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by $33.8\%$ compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Continuous-Time Transmission-Distribution-Interface Active and Reactive Flexibility for Flexible Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of power electronic devices, modern distribution networks are turning into flexible distribution networks (FDNs), which have enhanced active and reactive power flexibility at the transmission-distribution-interface (TDI). However, owing to the stochastics and volatility of distributed generation, the flexibility can change in real time and can hardly be accurately captured using conventional discrete-time (DT) assessment methods. This paper first proposes the notion of continuous-time (CT) TDI active and reactive flexibility and establishes its mathematical model. This model comprehensively considers the flexible devices in the FDN and the impact of uncertainty of photovoltaic power generation and load. In particular, a novel direction-factor-based metric is proposed to model CT-TDI PQ flexibility. Moreover, an efficient solution method is designed to address the difficulties in handling the infinite dimension of CT model and the complexity of bi-objectivity from assessing both active and reactive flexibility to be assessed. The solution successfully transforms the infinite dimensional optimization into a finite dimensional problem and effectively explores the PQ plane in a parallel pattern. Case studies show that the method can more effectively assess the real-time TDI flexibility of an FDN relative to conventional DT counterparts, and also reveals the impact of the relevant factors, such as penetrations of flexible devices and levels of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quantifying distribution system resilience from utility data: large event risk and benefits of investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on large blackouts in electric distribution systems caused by extreme winds. Such events have a large cost and impact on customers. To quantify resilience to these events, we formulate large event risk and show how to calculate it from the historical outage data routinely collected by utilities' outage management systems. Risk is defined using an event cost exceedance curve. The tail of this curve and the large event risk is described by the probability of a large cost event and the slope magnitude of the tail on a log-log plot. Resilience can be improved by planned investments to upgrade system components or speed up restoration. The benefits that these investments would have had if they had been made in the past can be quantified by "rerunning history" with the effects of the investment included, and then recalculating the large event risk to find the improvement in resilience. An example using utility data shows a 12% and 22% reduction in the probability of a large cost event due to 10% wind hardening and 10% faster restoration respectively. This new data-driven approach to quantify resilience and resilience investments is realistic and much easier to apply than complicated approaches based on modeling all the phases of resilience. Moreover, an appeal to improvements to past lived experience may well be persuasive to customers and regulators in making the case for resilience investments.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in 3D Spaces under Motion Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a three-dimensional nonlinear trajectory tracking control strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of spatial constraints. As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: In this report, we lay the foundation for amplitude noise and phase noise analysis in nonlinear devices. We build a theoretical framework that helps us to analyze extremely difficult problems which include both nonlinearity and noise of semiconductors. Using our proposed framework, we analytically calculate the amplitude noise and phase noise of nonlinear RC circuits in the presence of nonlinear capacitance and conductance. As a more practical example, we analyze the amplitude noise and phase noise of a common-emitter stage bipolar transistor.</description>

      <title>Aligning Models with Their Realization through Model-based Systems Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for aligning models with their realization through the application of model-based systems engineering. Our approach is divided into three steps. (1) Firstly, we leverage domain expertise and the Unified Architecture Framework to establish a reference model that fundamentally describes some domain. (2) Subsequently, we instantiate the reference model as specific models tailored to different scenarios within the domain. (3) Finally, we incorporate corresponding run logic directly into both the reference model and the specific models. In total, we thus provide a practical means to ensure that every implementation result is justified by business demand. We demonstrate our approach using the example of maritime object detection as a specific application (specific model / implementation element) of automatic target recognition as a service reoccurring in various forms (reference model element). Our approach facilitates a more seamless integration of models and implementation, fostering enhanced Business-IT alignment.</description>

      <title>Managing O-RAN Networks: xApp Development from Zero to Hero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance proposes an open architecture that disaggregates the RAN and supports executing custom control logic in near-real time from third-party applications, the xApps. Despite O-RAN's efforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor, aggravated by the fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and industry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive guide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem, from theory to practice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN architecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and detail its configuration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and manage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We dive deep into the xApps' interfaces and capabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We also provide comprehensive details on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and good practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we review the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.</description>

      <title>Impedance Measurement of Rolling Bearings Using an unbalanced AC Wheatstone Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industry 4.0 drives the demand for cost-efficient and reliable process data and condition monitoring. Therefore, visualizing the state of tribological contacts becomes important, as they are regularly found in the center of many applications. Utilizing rolling element bearings as sensors and monitoring their health by the electrical impedance method are promising approaches as it allows e.g. load sensing and detection of bearing failures. The impedance cannot be measured directly, but there are various methods available. This work discusses advantages and disadvantages and suggests the AC Wheatstone bridge as a reliable way of measuring impedances with low phase angles at sampling rates in the kHz range. The corresponding equations are introduced, a simulation built, an uncertainty mode and effects analysis carried out and sample measurement results of real rolling elements shown. It can be demonstrated that the AC Wheatstone bridge meets the proposed requirements for sensory utilization and condition monitoring when the bearing is operated in the hydrodynamic regime.</description>

      <title>Model-free Distortion Canceling and Control of Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum devices need precise control to achieve their full capability. In this work, we address the problem of controlling closed quantum systems, tackling two main issues. First, in practice the control signals are usually subject to unknown classical distortions that could arise from the device fabrication, material properties and/or instruments generating those signals. Second, in most cases modeling the system is very difficult or not even viable due to uncertainties in the relations between some variables and inaccessibility to some measurements inside the system. In this paper, we introduce a general model-free control approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), that can work for any closed quantum system. We train a deep neural network (NN), using the REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm to control the state probability distribution of a closed quantum system as it evolves, and drive it to different target distributions. We present a novel controller architecture that comprises multiple NNs. This enables accommodating as many different target state distributions as desired, without increasing the complexity of the NN or its training process. The used DRL algorithm works whether the control problem can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) or a partially observed MDP. Our method is valid whether the control signals are discrete- or continuous-valued. We verified our method through numerical simulations based on a photonic waveguide array chip. We trained a controller to generate sequences of different target output distributions of the chip with fidelity higher than 99%, where the controller showed superior performance in canceling the classical signal distortions.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization on Successive RIS-assisted Multi-hop Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an emerging wireless communication technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a basic choice for providing signal coverage services in scenarios with dense obstacles or long tunnels through multi-hop configurations. Conventional works of literature mainly focus on alternating optimization or single-beam calculation in RIS phase configuration, which is limited in considering energy efficiency, and often suffers from inaccurate channel state information (CSI), poor convergence, and high computational complexity. This paper addresses the design and optimization challenges for successive RIS-assisted multi-hop systems. Specifically, we establish a general model for multi-hop communication based on the relationship between the input and output electric fields within each RIS. Meanwhile, we derive the half-power beamwidth of the RIS-reflected beams, considering the beam direction. Leveraging these models and derivations, we propose deployment optimization and beam optimization strategies for multi-hop systems, which feature high aperture efficiency and significant gains in signal power. Simulation and prototype experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed systems and methods.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Hybrid Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a two-player zero-sum game under dynamic constraints defined by hybrid dynamical equations. The game consists of a min-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and resulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time and, hence, can flow or jump. We present sufficient conditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to guarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players select the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without computing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show that the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically stable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of this problem, as presented here, include a disturbance rejection scenario for which the effect of the perturbation is upper bounded, and a security scenario in which we formulate an optimal control problem under the presence of the maximizing adversarial action.</description>

      <title>ODD: Omni Differential Drive for Simultaneous Reconfiguration and Omnidirectional Mobility of Wheeled Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wheeled robots are highly efficient in human living environments. However, conventional wheeled designs, with their limited degrees of freedom and constraints in robot configuration, struggle to simultaneously achieve stability, passability, and agility due to varying footprint needs. This paper proposes a novel robot drive model inspired by human movements, termed as the Omni Differential Drive (ODD). The ODD model innovatively utilizes a lateral differential drive to adjust wheel spacing without adding additional actuators to the existing omnidirectional drive. This approach enables wheeled robots to achieve both simultaneous reconfiguration and omnidirectional mobility. To validate the feasibility of the ODD model, a functional prototype was developed, followed by comprehensive kinematic analyses. Control systems for self-balancing and motion control were designed and implemented. Experimental validations confirmed the feasibility of the ODD mechanism and the effectiveness of the control strategies. The results underline the potential of this innovative drive system to enhance the mobility and adaptability of robotic platforms.</description>

Abstract: For networked systems, Persistent Excitation and Integral Scrambling Condition are conditions ensuring that communication failures between agents can occur, but a minimal level of service is ensured. We consider cooperative multi-agent systems satisfying either of such conditions. For first-order systems, we prove that consensus is attained. For second-order systems, flocking is attained under a standard condition of nonintegrability of the interaction function. In both cases and under both conditions, the original goal is reached under no additional hypotheses on the system with respect to the case of no communication failures.</description>

      <title>Impact of Different Infrastructures and Traffic Scenarios on Behavioral and Physiological Responses of E-scooter Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As micromobility devices such as e-scooters gain global popularity, emergency departments around the world have observed a rising trend in related injuries. However, the majority of current research on e-scooter safety relies heavily on surveys, news reports, and data from vendors, with a noticeable scarcity of naturalistic studies examining the effects of riders' behaviors and physiological responses. Therefore, this paper aims to study the responses of e-scooter users under different infrastructures and scenarios through naturalistic riding experiments. The findings indicate that different speed profiles, infrastructural elements, and traffic scenarios significantly influence riding dynamics. The experimental results also reveal that e-scooters face amplified safety challenges when navigating through areas with speed variations and without dedicated riding spaces. The study underscores the importance of considering infrastructure design and its influence on e-scooter safety, providing insights that could inform future urban planning and policy-making to enhance the safety of these increasingly popular vehicles.</description>

      <title>3D Foundation Models Enable Simultaneous Geometry and Pose Estimation of Grasped Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans have the remarkable ability to use held objects as tools to interact with their environment. For this to occur, humans internally estimate how hand movements affect the object's movement. We wish to endow robots with this capability. We contribute methodology to jointly estimate the geometry and pose of objects grasped by a robot, from RGB images captured by an external camera. Notably, our method transforms the estimated geometry into the robot's coordinate frame, while not requiring the extrinsic parameters of the external camera to be calibrated. Our approach leverages 3D foundation models, large models pre-trained on huge datasets for 3D vision tasks, to produce initial estimates of the in-hand object. These initial estimations do not have physically correct scales and are in the camera's frame. Then, we formulate, and efficiently solve, a coordinate-alignment problem to recover accurate scales, along with a transformation of the objects to the coordinate frame of the robot. Forward kinematics mappings can subsequently be defined from the manipulator's joint angles to specified points on the object. These mappings enable the estimation of points on the held object at arbitrary configurations, enabling robot motion to be designed with respect to coordinates on the grasped objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a robot manipulator holding a diverse set of real-world objects.</description>

      <title>Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Decision-Making in Multi-Robot Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a distributed coordination paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal joint motion planning among multiple robots. Our coordination paradigm contrasts with current paradigms that are either near-optimal but impractical for replanning times or real-time but offer no near-optimality guarantees. We are motivated by the future of collaborative mobile autonomy, where distributed teams of robots will coordinate via vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) communication to execute information-heavy tasks like mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. To enable rapid distributed coordination, we must curtail the explosion of information-sharing across the network, thus limiting robot coordination. However, this can lead to suboptimal plans, causing overlapping trajectories instead of complementary ones. We make theoretical and algorithmic contributions to balance the trade-off between decision speed and optimality. We introduce tools for distributed submodular optimization, a diminishing returns property in information-gathering tasks. Theoretically, we analyze how local network topology affects near-optimality at the global level. Algorithmically, we provide a communication- and computation-efficient coordination algorithm for agents to balance the trade-off. Our algorithm is up to two orders faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms. In simulations of surveillance tasks with up to 45 robots, it enables real-time planning at the order of 1 Hz with superior coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we provide a high-fidelity simulator that extends AirSim by integrating a collaborative autonomy pipeline and simulating v2v communication delays.</description>

Abstract: A Dyson ring is a hypothetical megastructure, that a very advanced civilization would build around a star to harness more of its energy. Satellite propagation is of high priority in such a vast world where distances could very well be measured in astronomical units. We analyze the ring's parameters and stability and propose a stable helical orbit around the Dyson ring influenced by the gravity of the Dyson ring and the Sun. Taking theoretically explainable values for all parameters, we describe our approach to finding this orbit and present the successful simulation of a satellite's flight in this path.</description>

      <title>A Convex Method of Generalized State Estimation using Circuit-theoretic Node-breaker Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14742v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date topology is critical for situational awareness of a power grid; however, wrong switch statuses due to physical damage, communication error, or cyber-attack, can often result in topology errors. To maintain situation awareness under the possible topology errors and bad data, this paper develops ckt-GSE, a circuit-theoretic generalized state estimation method using node-breaker (NB) model. Ckt- GSE is a convex and scalable model that jointly estimates AC state variables and network topology, with robustness against different data errors. The method first constructs an equivalent circuit representation of the AC power grid by developing and aggregating linear circuit models of SCADA meters, phasor measurement units(PMUs), and switching devices. Then based on this circuit, ckt-GSE defines a constrained optimization problem using weighted least absolute value (WLAV) objective to form a robust estimator. The problem is a Linear Programming (LP) problem whose solution includes accurate AC states and a sparse vector of noise terms to identify topology errors and bad data.This paper is the first to explore a circuit-theoretic approach for an AC-network constrained GSE algorithm that is: 1) applicable to the real-world data setting, 2) convex without relaxation, scalable with our circuit-based solver; and 3) robust with the ability to identify and reject different data errors</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic relays and solenoid actuators are commonly used for their bistable behavior, which allows for switching between two states in electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic circuits, among other applications. Although there has been extensive research on modeling, estimation, and control of these electromechanical systems, a gap remains in the analysis area. This paper addresses this gap by presenting an equilibrium and stability analysis to gain deeper insight into their bistability. This analysis leverages a hybrid dynamical model to obtain analytical expressions that relate the physical parameters to the switching conditions. These expressions are useful, e.g., for fundamental understanding, quick analyses, or design optimization. The results are discussed in depth and potential practical applications are explored. Finally, the analysis is validated with experimental results from a real device.</description>

Abstract: How to determine the vector of power supplies of a stochastic power system for the next short horizon, such that the probability is less than a prespecified value that any phase-angle difference of a power line of the power network exits from a safe set? The power system is modelled such that the differential equation of each frequency is affected by a Brownian motion process. A safe set can be selected to be any subset of the interval $(-\pi/2, ~ +\pi/2)$, which is a sufficient condition for not losing synchronization. That the controlled system has an improved performance is shown by numerical results of three academic examples including a particular eight-node academic network, a twelve-node ring network, and a Manhattan-grid network.</description>

The method, which solves for the unknown parameter by directly inverting the dynamics using regularized linear regression, is based on new design and analysis ideas for differentiation filtering and regularized least squares. Combined in series, they yield a novel finite-sample bound on mean absolute error of estimation.</description>

Abstract: A key challenge that is currently hindering the widespread use of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries for second-life (SL) applications is the ability to accurately estimate and monitor their state of health (SOH). Second-life battery systems can be sourced from different battery packs with lack of knowledge of their historical usage. To tackle the in-the-field use of SL batteries, this paper introduces an online adaptive health estimation approach with guaranteed bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability. This method relies exclusively on operational data that can be accessed in real time from SL batteries. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on a laboratory aged experimental data set of retired EV batteries. The estimator gains are dynamically adapted to accommodate the distinct characteristics of each individual cell, making it a promising candidate for future SL battery management systems (BMS2).</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment with Herd Behaviour Using Rational Decision Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal investment problem considering the herd behaviour between two agents, including one leading expert and one following agent whose decisions are influenced by those of the leading expert. In the objective functional of the optimal investment problem, we introduce the average deviation term to measure the distance between the two agents' decisions and use the variational method to find its analytical solution. To theoretically analyze the impact of the following agent's herd behaviour on his/her decision, we decompose his/her optimal decision into a convex linear combination of the two agents' rational decisions, which we call the rational decision decomposition. Furthermore, we define the weight function in the rational decision decomposition as the following agent's investment opinion to measure the preference of his/her own rational decision over that of the leading expert. We use the investment opinion to quantitatively analyze the impact of the herd behaviour, the following agent's initial wealth, the excess return, and the volatility of the risky asset on the optimal decision. We validate our analyses through numerical experiments on real stock data. This study is crucial to understanding investors' herd behaviour in decision-making and designing effective mechanisms to guide their decisions.</description>

      <title>Improving a Proportional Integral Controller with Reinforcement Learning on a Throttle Valve Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based control strategy for non-linear throttle valves with an asymmetric hysteresis, leading to a near-optimal controller without requiring any prior knowledge about the environment. We start with a carefully tuned Proportional Integrator (PI) controller and exploit the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Guides to improve the closed-loop behavior by learning from the additional interactions with the valve. We test the proposed control method in various scenarios on three different valves, all highlighting the benefits of combining both PI and RL frameworks to improve control performance in non-linear stochastic systems. In all the experimental test cases, the resulting agent has a better sample efficiency than traditional RL agents and outperforms the PI controller.</description>

      <title>Set-membership target search and tracking within an unknown cluttered area using cooperating UAVs equipped with vision systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of target search and tracking using a fleet of cooperating UAVs evolving in some unknown region of interest containing an a priori unknown number of moving ground targets. Each drone is equipped with an embedded Computer Vision System (CVS), providing an image with labeled pixels and a depth map of the observed part of its environment. Moreover, a box containing the corresponding pixels in the image frame is available when a UAV identifies a target. Hypotheses regarding information provided by the pixel classification, depth map construction, and target identification algorithms are proposed to allow its exploitation by set-membership approaches. A set-membership target location estimator is developed using the information provided by the CVS. Each UAV evaluates sets guaranteed to contain the location of the identified targets and a set possibly containing the locations of targets still to be identified. Then, each UAV uses these sets to search and track targets cooperatively.</description>

      <title>Efficient Economic Model Predictive Control of Water Treatment Process with Learning-based Koopman Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Used water treatment plays a pivotal role in advancing environmental sustainability. Economic model predictive control holds the promise of enhancing the overall operational performance of the water treatment facilities. In this study, we propose a data-driven economic predictive control approach within the Koopman modeling framework. First, we propose a deep learning-enabled input-output Koopman modeling approach, which predicts the overall economic operational cost of the wastewater treatment process based on input data and available output measurements that are directly linked to the operational costs. Subsequently, by leveraging this learned input-output Koopman model, a convex economic predictive control scheme is developed. The resulting predictive control problem can be efficiently solved by leveraging quadratic programming solvers, and complex non-convex optimization problems are bypassed. The proposed method is applied to a benchmark wastewater treatment process. The proposed method significantly improves the overall economic operational performance of the water treatment process. Additionally, the computational efficiency of the proposed method is significantly enhanced as compared to benchmark control solutions.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, CoNSAL directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply CoNSAL to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions. Code examples are available at https://github.com/HaohanZou/CoNSAL.</description>

      <title>Learning operando impedance function for battery health with aging-aware equivalent circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wide usage of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) requires a deep understanding about battery health. Estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH) is a crucial but yet still challenging task. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and instability of parameter estimations in lifelong aging. While pure data-driven methods rely heavily on quality and quantity of training set, causing lack of generality when extrapolating into unseen cases. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware equivalent circuit model (ECM), which combines model-based and data-driven techniques for SOH estimation. Gaussian process (GP) regression is incorporated in ECM to modelling parameters dependency on operating condition and aging time. The state space formulation of GP is used to enable a computationally efficient co-estimation framework of both parameters and states. Samples from two Open datasets are used to validate model performance, which gives accurate estimation for capacity and impedance. The learnt impedance function can be lined to the shape change of open circuit voltage (OCV) versus SOC curve and thus providing a way to further estimate changes of differential voltage (dV/dQ) curves.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Backstepping and Non-singular Sliding Mode Control for Quadrotor UAVs with Unknown Time-varying Uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quaternion-based nonsingular control system for underactuated vertical-take-off and landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Position and attitude tracking is challenging regarding singularity and accuracy. Quaternion-based Adaptive Backstepping Control (QABC) is developed to tackle the underactuated issues of UAV control systems in a cascaded way. Leveraging the virtual control (auxiliary control) developed in the QABC, desired attitude components and required thrust are produced. Afterwards, we propose Quaternion-based Sliding Mode Control (QASMC) to enhance the stability and mitigate chattering issues. The sliding surface is modified to avoid singularity compared to conventional SMC. To improve the robustness of controllers, the control parameters are updated using adaptation laws. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of translational and rotational dynamics is guaranteed by utilizing Lyapunov stability and Barbalet Lemma. Finally, the comprehensive comparison results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers in the presence of unknown time-varying parameter uncertainties and significant initial errors.

      <description>arXiv:2201.02395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feedback optimization is a control paradigm that enables physical systems to autonomously reach efficient operating points. Its central idea is to interconnect optimization iterations in closed-loop with the physical plant. Since iterative gradient-based methods are extensively used to achieve optimality, feedback optimization controllers typically require the knowledge of the steady-state sensitivity of the plant, which may not be easily accessible in some applications. In contrast, in this paper, we develop a model-free feedback controller for efficient steady-state operation of general dynamical systems. The proposed design consists of updating control inputs via gradient estimates constructed from evaluations of the nonconvex objective at the current input and at the measured output. We study the dynamic interconnection of the proposed iterative controller with a stable nonlinear discrete-time plant. For this setup, we characterize the optimality and stability of the closed-loop behavior as functions of the problem dimension, the number of iterations, and the rate of convergence of the physical plant. To handle general constraints that affect multiple inputs, we enhance the controller with Frank-Wolfe-type updates.</description>

Abstract: We extend discrete-time explicit model predictive control (MPC) rigorously to linear distributed parameter systems. After formulating an MPC framework and giving a relevant KKT theorem, we realize fast regionless explicit MPC by using the dual active set method QPKWIK.

      <description>arXiv:2206.09963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the sample average approximation (SAA) approach for non-convex stochastic programming. We show that applying the SAA approach to problems with expected value equality constraints does not necessarily result in asymptotic optimality guarantees as the sample size increases. To address this issue, we relax the equality constraints. Then, we prove the asymptotic optimality of the modified SAA approach under mild smoothness and boundedness conditions on the equality constraint functions. Our analysis uses random set theory and concentration inequalities to characterize the approximation error from the sampling procedure. We apply our approach and analysis to the problem of stochastic optimal control for nonlinear dynamical systems under external disturbances modeled by a Wiener process. Numerical results on relevant stochastic programs show the reliability of the proposed approach. Results on a rocket-powered descent problem show that our computed solutions allow for significant uncertainty reduction compared to a deterministic baseline.</description>

      <title>Constrained Reinforcement Learning using Distributional Representation for Trustworthy Quadrotor UAV Tracking Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously accurate and reliable tracking control for quadrotors in complex dynamic environments is challenging. As aerodynamics derived from drag forces and moment variations are chaotic and difficult to precisely identify, most current quadrotor tracking systems treat them as simple `disturbances' in conventional control approaches. We propose a novel, interpretable trajectory tracker integrating a Distributional Reinforcement Learning disturbance estimator for unknown aerodynamic effects with a Stochastic Model Predictive Controller (SMPC). The proposed estimator `Constrained Distributional Reinforced disturbance estimator' (ConsDRED) accurately identifies uncertainties between true and estimated values of aerodynamic effects. Simplified Affine Disturbance Feedback is used for control parameterization to guarantee convexity, which we then integrate with a SMPC. We theoretically guarantee that ConsDRED achieves at least an optimal global convergence rate and a certain sublinear rate if constraints are violated with an error decreases as the width and the layer of neural network increase. To demonstrate practicality, we show convergent training in simulation and real-world experiments, and empirically verify that ConsDRED is less sensitive to hyperparameter settings compared with canonical constrained RL approaches. We demonstrate our system improves accumulative tracking errors by at least 70% compared with the recent art. Importantly, the proposed framework, ConsDRED-SMPC, balances the tradeoff between pursuing high performance and obeying conservative constraints for practical implementations.</description>

Abstract: Many new methodologies for the control of large-scale multi-agent systems are based on macroscopic representations of the emerging system dynamics, in the form of continuum approximations of large ensembles. These techniques, that are developed in the limit case of an infinite number of agents, are usually validated only through numerical simulations. In this paper, we introduce a mixed reality set-up for testing swarm robotics techniques, focusing on the macroscopic collective motion of robotic swarms. This hybrid apparatus combines both real differential drive robots and virtual agents to create a heterogeneous swarm of tunable size. We also extend continuification-based control methods for swarms to higher dimensions, and assess experimentally their validity in the new platform. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the platform for conducting large-scale swarm robotics experiments, and it contributes new theoretical insights into control algorithms exploiting continuification approaches.</description>

Abstract: As modern systems become ever more connected with complex dynamic coupling relationships, developing safe control methods becomes paramount. In this paper, we discuss the relationship of node-level safety definitions for individual agents with local neighborhood dynamics. We define a collaborative control barrier function (CCBF) and provide conditions under which sets defined by these functions will be forward invariant. We use collaborative node-level control barrier functions to construct a novel \edit{decentralized} algorithm for the safe control of collaborating network agents and provide conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a viable set of safe control actions for all agents. We illustrate these results on a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating and updating the obstacle avoidance velocity for an autonomous robot in real-time ensures robustness against noise and disturbances. A passive damping controller can obtain the desired motion with a torque-controlled robot, which remains compliant and ensures a safe response to external perturbations. Here, we propose a novel approach for designing the passive control policy. Our algorithm complies with obstacle-free zones while transitioning to increased damping near obstacles to ensure collision avoidance. This approach ensures stability across diverse scenarios, effectively mitigating disturbances. Validation on a 7DoF robot arm demonstrates superior collision rejection capabilities compared to the baseline, underlining its practicality for real-world applications. Our obstacle-aware damping controller represents a substantial advancement in secure robot control within complex and uncertain environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing UAS Traffic Management (UTM) frameworks designate preplanned flight paths to uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), enabling the UAS to deliver payloads. However, with increasing delivery demand between the source-destination pairs in the urban airspace, UAS will likely experience considerable congestion on the nominal paths. We propose a rule-based congestion mitigation strategy that improves UAS safety and airspace utilization in congested traffic streams. The strategy relies on nominal path information from the UTM and positional information of other UAS in the vicinity. Following the strategy, UAS opts for alternative local paths in the unoccupied airspace surrounding the nominal path and avoids congested regions. The strategy results in UAS traffic exploring and spreading to alternative adjacent routes on encountering congestion. The paper presents queuing models to estimate the expected traffic spread for varying stochastic delivery demand at the source, thus helping to reserve the airspace around the nominal path beforehand to accommodate any foreseen congestion. Simulations are presented to validate the queuing results in the presence of static obstacles and intersecting UAS streams.</description>

      <title>Auto-Multilift: Distributed Learning and Control for Cooperative Load Transportation With Quadrotors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing motion control and planning algorithms for multilift systems remains challenging due to the complexities of dynamics, collision avoidance, actuator limits, and scalability. Existing methods that use optimization and distributed techniques effectively address these constraints and scalability issues. However, they often require substantial manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes Auto-Multilift, a novel framework that automates the tuning of model predictive controllers (MPCs) for multilift systems. We model the MPC cost functions with deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling fast online adaptation to various scenarios. We develop a distributed policy gradient algorithm to train these DNNs efficiently in a closed-loop manner. Central to our algorithm is distributed sensitivity propagation, which is built on fully exploiting the unique dynamic couplings within the multilift system. It parallelizes gradient computation across quadrotors and focuses on actual system state sensitivities relative to key MPC parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate favorable scalability to a large number of quadrotors. Our method outperforms a state-of-the-art open-loop MPC tuning approach by effectively learning adaptive MPCs from trajectory tracking errors. It also excels in learning an adaptive reference for reconfiguring the system when traversing multiple narrow slots.</description>

Abstract: The explosive surge in Human-AI interactions, fused with a soaring fascination in wearable technology, has ignited a frenzy of innovation and the emergence of a myriad of Wearable AI devices, each wielding diverse form factors, tackling tasks from health surveillance to turbocharging productivity. This paper delves into the vision for wearable AI technology, addressing the technical bottlenecks that stand in the way of its promised advancements.
  Embracing a paradigm shift, we introduce a Human-Inspired Distributed Network for Wearable AI, enabled by high-speed ultra-low-power secure connectivity via the emerging 'Body as a Wire' (Wi-R) technology. This breakthrough acts as the missing link: the artificial nervous system, seamlessly interconnecting all wearables and implantables, ushering in a new era of interconnected intelligence, where featherweight, perpetually operating wearable AI nodes redefine the boundaries of possibility.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Physics-Informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimate of long-term risk is critical for safe decision-making, but sampling from rare risk events and long-term trajectories can be prohibitively costly. Risk gradient can be used in many first-order techniques for learning and control methods, but gradient estimate is difficult to obtain using Monte Carlo (MC) methods because the infinitesimal divisor may significantly amplify sampling noise. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that the proposed technique has improved sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and adapts to changing system parameters.</description>
