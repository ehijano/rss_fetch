      <title>AtomDisc: An Atom-level Tokenizer that Boosts Molecular LLMs and Reveals Structure--Property Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are accelerating discovery in molecular science. However, adapting molecular information to the serialized, token-based processing of LLMs remains a key challenge. Compared to other representations, molecular graphs explicitly encode atomic connectivity and local topological environments, which are key determinants of atomic behavior and molecular properties. Despite recent efforts to tokenize overall molecular topology, there still lacks effective fine-grained tokenization of local atomic environments, which are critical for determining sophisticated chemical properties and reactivity. To address these issues, we introduce AtomDisc, a novel framework that quantizes atom-level local environments into structure-aware tokens embedded directly in LLM's token space. Our experiments show that AtomDisc, in a data-driven way, can distinguish chemically meaningful structural features that reveal structure-property associations. Equipping LLMs with AtomDisc tokens injects an interpretable inductive bias that delivers state-of-the-art performance on property prediction and molecular generation. Our methodology and findings can pave the way for constructing more powerful molecular LLMs aimed at mechanistic insight and complex chemical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Digital Surfactant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants play an important role in determining the cleaning performance and stability of detergents. However, the design of new surfactants using traditional methods is often time-consuming, complex, and largely based on trial and error. Recent studies have incorporated data-driven and computational approaches to generate new surfactants and predict properties of surfactants, but most of these approaches either optimize on a single property or train on a small number of surfactants. In this work, we investigate the generative capabilities of an existing graph diffusion based inverse design model and a transformer based molecule optimization model, for non-ionic surfactants. We train both models to generate non-ionic surfactants based on single- and multi-property values, predict the same properties o using trained property predictor models for generated molecules, and validate a few them using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the inverse design model is better at generating a diverse set of molecules, while the transformer is better at generating molecules which satisfy input property constraints better. We also observe that molecules generated using single property condition, on average, satisfy the input property condition better when compared to molecules generated using multiple property conditions. From molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that the predicted properties of the selected molecules are close to the simulated results concluding that both methods are capable of generating surfactants that actually satisfy input property condtions.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Cavity-Molecular Dynamics of Vibrational Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) approach with a light-matter Hamiltonian beyond the long-wavelength approximation to propagate the dynamics of vibrational polaritons formed by coupling molecular vibrations to confined radiation inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity. Here, we develop a parallelized propagation scheme with lightweight inter-CPU communication by exploiting the sparse nature of the light-matter interactions in the real space representation. We find that the computationally expensive Born charges required for our propagation can be replaced with the computationally inexpensive Mulliken charges to obtain qualitatively accurate linear spectra especially when the nonlinearity (arising from molecular vibrations) of the light-matter interaction term is not substantial. However, the same approach may not be suitable to be used for studying cavity modification of energy transport or chemical dynamics as this approximation leads to spurious heating of the light-matter hybrid system. We demonstrate the utility of this on-the-fly approach to compute angle resolved polaritonic spectra of water. We implement our approach as an open-source computational package, CavOTF, which is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. Despite the pronounced growth of ionic clusters, their percolation transition does not appear to be directly coupled to the onset of these crossovers. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.</description>

      <title>Zero-Waste Biorefinery: Pyrolysis of Fermentation Residues into Catalytic Biochar for Circular Biohydrogen Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a closed-loop biorefinery strategy that thermochemically upcycles fermentation residues (FRs) from photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) into functional biochar catalysts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the initial PFHP process. Four FRs derived from hydrothermal and ethylene glycol-pretreated corn stover were pyrolyzed at 700{\deg}C. Multi-model kinetic analyses revealed diffusion-controlled mechanisms with activation energies ranging from 157 to 278 kJ/mol, while thermodynamic profiling highlighted the influence of feedstock composition on reaction spontaneity and entropy. Pyrolysis effectively restored porosity compromised during fermentation, yielding biochar with tailored properties: microporous BC3 (185 m2/g) from oxygen-rich precursors and mesoporous BC4 (76.58 m2/g) from graphitized residues. When reintroduced into PFHP, BC3 maximized cumulative hydrogen yield (570 mL) via pH buffering, and BC4 achieved the highest production rate (14.91 mL/h) through electron shuttle mechanisms. The integrated process concurrently generated syngas, bio-oil, and catalytic biochar, enabling waste valorization, renewable energy output, and process enhancement within a circular bioeconomy framework.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics of Chemical Bond Formation: Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.</description>

      <title>Atomic Diffusion Models for Small Molecule Structure Elucidation from NMR Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a cornerstone technique for determining the structures of small molecules and is especially critical in the discovery of novel natural products and clinical therapeutics. Yet, interpreting NMR spectra remains a time-consuming, manual process requiring extensive domain expertise. We introduce ChefNMR (CHemical Elucidation From NMR), an end-to-end framework that directly predicts an unknown molecule's structure solely from its 1D NMR spectra and chemical formula. We frame structure elucidation as conditional generation from an atomic diffusion model built on a non-equivariant transformer architecture. To model the complex chemical groups found in natural products, we generated a dataset of simulated 1D NMR spectra for over 111,000 natural products. ChefNMR predicts the structures of challenging natural product compounds with an unsurpassed accuracy of over 65%. This work takes a significant step toward solving the grand challenge of automating small-molecule structure elucidation and highlights the potential of deep learning in accelerating molecular discovery.

      <title>Computer Simulation of the Growth of a Metal-Organic Framework Proto-crystal at Constant Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) synthesis protocols is currently largely driven by trial-and-error, since we lack fundamental understanding of the molecular level mechanisms that underlie their self-assembly processes. Previous works have studied the nucleation of MOFs, but their growth has never been studied by means of computer simulations, which provide molecular level detail. In this work, we combine constant chemical potential simulations with a particle insertion method to model the growth of the ZIF-8 MOF at varying synthesis temperatures and concentrations of the reactants. Non-classical growth mechanisms triggered by oligomer attachments were detected, with a higher predominance in the most concentrated setups. The newly formed layers preserve the pore-like density profile of the seed crystal but contain defective sites characterized by the presence of 3, 5 and 7 membered rings, typical of amorphous phases. Compared to the amorphous intermediate species obtained at the nucleation part of the self-assembly process previously investigated in our group [Chem. Mater., doi: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5c02028, 2025], larger-sized rings are more common in the grown layer. Moreover, these are favored by increasing reactant concentration and temperature, as is the degree of deviation with respect to the original crystal structure. We computed growth rates for the steady-state regime, and the non-linear tendency with respect to concentration leads us to hypothesize that in these conditions the growth is controlled by the adsorption rather than by the diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanoscale Molecular Organization in Liquid Crystals via Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.</description>

Abstract: The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Tin perovskites are the most promising environmentally friendly alternative to lead perovskites. Among tin perovskites, FASnI3 (CH4N2SnI3) shows optimum band gap, and easy processability. However, the performance of FASnI3 based solar cells is incomparable to lead perovskites for several reasons, including energy band mismatch between the perovskite absorber film and the charge transporting layers (CTLs) for both types of carriers, i.e., for electrons (ETLs) and holes (HTLs). However, the band diagrams in the literature are inconsistent, and the charge extraction dynamics are poorly understood. In this paper, we study the energy band positions of FASnI3 based perovskites using Kelvin probe (KP) and photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) to provide a precise band diagram of the most used device stack. In addition, we analyze the defects within the current energetic landscape of tin perovskites. We uncover the role of bathocuproine (BCP) in enhancing the electron extraction at the fullerene C60/BCP interface. Furthermore, we used transient surface photovoltage (tr-SPV) for the first time for tin perovskites to understand the charge extraction dynamics of the most reported HTLs such as NiOx and PEDOT, and ETLs such as C60, ICBA, and PCBM. Finally, we used Hall effect, KP, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) to estimate an accurate value of the p-doping concentration in FASnI3 and showed a consistent result of 1.5 * 1017 cm-3. Our findings prove that the energetic system of tin halide perovskites is deformed and should be redesigned independently from lead perovskites to unlock the full potential of tin perovskites.</description>

Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.</description>

      <title>Coherent X-rays reveal anomalous molecular diffusion and cage effects in crowded protein solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein motion within the cell is crucial for predicting reaction rates and macromolecular transport in the cytoplasm. A key question is how crowded environments affect protein dynamics through hydrodynamic and direct interactions at molecular length scales. Using megahertz X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EuXFEL), we investigate ferritin diffusion at microsecond time scales. Our results reveal anomalous diffusion, indicated by the non-exponential decay of the intensity autocorrelation function $g_2(q,t)$ at high concentrations. This behavior is consistent with the presence of cage-trapping in between the short- and long-time protein diffusion regimes. Modeling with the $\delta\gamma$-theory of hydrodynamically interacting colloidal spheres successfully reproduces the experimental data by including a scaling factor linked to the protein direct interactions. These findings offer new insights into the complex molecular motion in crowded protein solutions, with potential applications for optimizing ferritin-based drug delivery, where protein diffusion is the rate-limiting step.</description>

Abstract: Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed-phase and interface systems with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface test cases, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer effects from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. The framework introduced in this work is simple and general, offering a practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and ad hoc fitting.</description>
