      <title>Mitigating Dynamic Tip-Over during Mobile Crane Slewing using Input Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Payload swing during rapid slewing of mobile cranes poses a safety risk, as it generates overturning moments that can lead to tip-over accidents of mobile cranes. Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

      <title>Model Reduction of Multicellular Communication Systems via Singular Perturbation: Sender Receiver Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multicellular sender receiver systems embedded in hydrogel beads, where diffusible signals mediate interactions among heterogeneous cells. Such systems are modeled by PDE ODE couplings that combine three dimensional diffusion with nonlinear intracellular dynamics, making analysis and simulation challenging. We show that the diffusion dynamics converges exponentially to a quasi steady spatial profile and use singular perturbation theory to reduce the model to a finite dimensional multiagent network. A closed form communication matrix derived from the spherical Green's function captures the effective sender receiver coupling. Numerical results show the reduced model closely matches the full dynamics while enabling scalable simulation of large cell populations.</description>

      <title>Gig-work Management System with Chance-Constraints Verification Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes the framework of an efficient gig-work management system. A gig-work management system recommends one-off tasks with information about task hours and wages to gig-workers. To enable effective management, this paper develops a model of gig-workers' decision-making. Then, based on the model, we formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal task hours and wages. The formulated problem belongs to the class of chance-constrained model predictive control (CC-MPC) problems. To efficiently solve the CC-MPC problem, we develop an approximate solution algorithm with guaranteed confidence levels. Finally, we develop gig-worker models based on data collected through crowdsourcing.</description>

      <title>Controlled Evolution-Based Day-Ahead Robust Dispatch Considering Frequency Security with Frequency Regulation Loads and Curtailable Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the extensive integration of volatile and uncertain renewable energy, power systems face significant challenges in primary frequency regulation due to instantaneous power fluctuations. However, the maximum frequency deviation constraint is inherently non-convex, and commonly used two-stage dispatch methods overlook causality, potentially resulting in infeasible day-ahead decisions. This paper presents a controlled evolution-based day-ahead robust dispatch method to address these issues. First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability. Additionally, a novel controlled evolution-based algorithm is developed to solve this framework efficiently. Case studies on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in enhancing frequency security and system reliability.</description>

      <title>An Input-Output Data-Driven Dissipativity Approach for Compositional Stability Certification of Interconnected LTI MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11468v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an input-output data-driven framework for certifying the stability of interconnected multiple-input-multiple-output linear time-invariant discrete-time systems via QSR-dissipativity. That is, by using measured input-output trajectories of each subsystem, we verify dissipative properties and extract local passivity indices without requiring an explicit model identification. These passivity indices are then used to derive conditions under which the equilibrium of the interconnected system is stable. In particular, the framework identifies how the lack of passivity in some subsystems can be compensated by surpluses in others. The proposed approach enables a compositional stability analysis by combining subsystem-level conditions into a criterion valid for the overall interconnected system. We illustrate via a numerical case study, how to compute channel-wise passivity indices and infer stability guarantees directly from data with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Robust Model Predictive Control Method for Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustly compensating network constraints such as delays and packet dropouts in networked control systems is crucial for remotely controlling dynamical systems. This work proposes a novel prediction consistent method to cope with delays and packet losses as encountered in UDP-type communication systems. The augmented control system preserves all properties of the original model predictive control method under the network constraints. Furthermore, we propose to use linear tube MPC with the novel method and show that the system converges robustly to the origin under mild conditions. We illustrate this with simulation examples of a cart pole and a continuous stirred tank reactor.</description>

      <title>Optimal Delay Compensation in Networked Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked Predictive Control is widely used to mitigate the effect of delays and dropouts in Networked Control Systems, particularly when these exceed the sampling time. A key design choice of these methods is the delay bound, which determines the prediction horizon and the robustness to information loss. This work develops a systematic method to select the optimal bound by quantifying the trade-off between prediction errors and open-loop operation caused by communication losses. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance gains achieved with the optimal bound.</description>

      <title>Shared Situational Awareness Using Hybrid Zonotopes with Confidence Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Situational awareness for connected and automated vehicles describes the ability to perceive and predict the behavior of other road-users in the near surroundings. However, pedestrians can become occluded by vehicles or infrastructure, creating significant safety risks due to limited visibility. Vehicle-to-everything communication enables the sharing of perception data between connected road-users, allowing for a more comprehensive awareness. The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in both simulation and real experiments.</description>

      <title>Data-driven control-oriented modelling for MPC-based control of urban drainage systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a data-driven, control-oriented modelling methodology for urban drainage systems (UDS). The proposed framework requires three main key components: input-output data from the element to be modelled, expert knowledge to define the model structure, and data-fitting techniques to obtain optimal parameters. The methodology is evaluated using a realistic benchmark from an UDS in Madrid, Spain. The results show high model accuracy and improved performance within a MPC scheme, reducing discharge and increasing treatment facilities utilization.</description>

      <title>A Modeling and Optimization Framework for Fostering Modal Shift through the Integration of Tradable Credits and Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tradable Credit Schemes (TCS) promote the use of public and shared transport by capping private car usage while maintaining fair welfare outcomes by allowing credit trading. However, most existing studies assume unlimited public transit capacity or a fixed occupancy of shared modes, often neglecting waiting time and oversimplifying time-based costs by depending solely on in-vehicle travel time. These assumptions can overstate the system's performance with TCS regulation, especially when there are insufficient public or shared transport supplies.
  To address this, we develop a dynamic multimodal equilibrium model to capture operation constraints and induced waiting times under TCS regulation. The model integrates travelers' mode choices, credit trading, traffic dynamics, and waiting time, which depend on key operational features of service vehicles such as fleet size and capacity.
  Besides, most TCS studies assume fixed transport supply, overlooking supply-side responses triggered by demand shifts. Therefore, we further propose integrating adaptive supply management through the deployment of Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles (DRAS) and developing a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates the equilibrium model to jointly optimize TCS design and operational strategies for the DRAS.
  We apply the framework to a section of the A10 highway near Paris, France, to examine demand-supply interactions and assess the potential benefits of jointly implementing TCS and DRAS. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of modeling operational features within multimodal equilibrium and incorporating flexible supply in TCS policies for mitigating overall generalized cost.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Decompositions of High-dimensional Configurations for Efficient Multi-vehicle Coordination at Intelligent Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For multi-vehicle complex traffic scenarios in shared spaces such as intelligent intersections, safe coordination and trajectory planning is challenging due to computational complexity. To meet this challenge, we introduce a computationally efficient method for generating collision-free trajectories along predefined vehicle paths. We reformulate a constrained minimum-time trajectory planning problem as a problem in a high-dimensional configuration space, where conflict zones are modeled by high-dimensional polyhedra constructed from two-dimensional rectangles. Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems. The resulting trajectories are then incorporated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework to ensure safe and smooth vehicle motion. We furthermore show in numerical evaluation that this approach significantly outperforms existing MILP-based time-scheduling; both in terms of objective-value and computational time.</description>

      <title>Model Error Resonance: The Geometric Nature of Error Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric theory of model error, treating true and model dynamics as geodesic flows generated by distinct affine connections on a smooth manifold. When these connections differ, the resulting trajectory discrepancy--termed the Latent Error Dynamic Response (LEDR)--acquires an intrinsic dynamical structure governed by curvature. We show that the LEDR satisfies a Jacobi-type equation, where curvature mismatch acts as an explicit forcing term. In the important case of a flat model connection, the LEDR reduces to a classical Jacobi field on the true manifold, causing Model Error Resonance (MER) to emerge under positive sectional curvature. The theory is extended to a discrete-time analogue, establishing that this geometric structure and its resonant behavior persist in sampled systems. A closed-form analysis of a sphere--plane example demonstrates that curvature can be inferred directly from the LEDR evolution. This framework provides a unified geometric interpretation of structured error dynamics and offers foundational tools for curvature-informed model validation.</description>

      <title>LUCID: Learning-Enabled Uncertainty-Aware Certification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of AI-enabled systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare, has become increasingly critical. Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Toward a Decision Support System for Energy-Efficient Ferry Operation on Lake Constance based on Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by three main factors: autonomy, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

      <title>RMSup: Physics-Informed Radio Map Super-Resolution for Compute-Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) provide a spatially continuous description of wireless propagation, enabling cross-layer optimization and unifying communication and sensing for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, constructing high-fidelity RMs at operational scales is difficult, since physics-based solvers are time-consuming and require precise scene models, while learning methods degrade under incomplete priors and sparse measurements, often smoothing away critical discontinuities. We present RMSup, a physics-informed super-resolution framework that functions with uniform sparse sampling and imperfect environment priors. RMSup extracts Helmholtz equation-informed boundary and singularity prompts from the measurements, fuses them with base-station side information and coarse scene descriptors as conditional inputs, and employs a boundary-aware dual-head network to reconstruct a high-fidelity RM and recover environmental contours jointly. Experimental results show the proposed RMsup achieves state-of-the-art performance both in RM construction and ISAC-related environment sensing.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Dynamical Modeling of Extrusion Based 3D Printing Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade off between model fidelity and computational cost remains a central challenge in the computational modeling of extrusion based 3D printing, particularly for real time optimization and control. Although high fidelity simulations have advanced considerably for offline analysis, dynamical modeling tailored for online, control oriented applications is still significantly underdeveloped. In this study, we propose a reduced order dynamical flow model that captures the transient behavior of extrusion based 3D printing. The model is grounded in physics based principles derived from the Navier Stokes equations and further simplified through spatial averaging and input dependent parameterization. To assess its performance, the model is identified via a nonlinear least squares approach using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data spanning a range of printing conditions and subsequently validated across multiple combinations of training and testing scenarios. The results demonstrate strong agreement with the CFD data within the nozzle, the nozzle substrate gap, and the deposited layer regions. Overall, the proposed reduced order model successfully captures the dominant flow dynamics of the process while maintaining a level of simplicity compatible with real time control and optimization.</description>

      <title>Linear quadratic control for discrete-time systems with stochastic and bounded noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the linear quadratic control (LQC) design of systems corrupted by both stochastic noise and bounded noise simultaneously. When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Validation of Closed-Form CBF-Based Safe Control for Stewart Platform Under Multiple Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a closed-form solution of Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework for enforcing safety constraints on a Stewart robotic platform. The proposed method simultaneously handles multiple position and velocity constraints through an explicit closed-form control law, eliminating the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) at every control step and enabling efficient real-time implementation. This letter derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closed-form expression remains non-singular, thereby ensuring well-posedness of the CBF solution to multi-constraint problem. The controller is validated in both simulation and hardware experiments on a custom-built Stewart platform prototype, demonstrating safetyguaranteed performance that is comparable to the QP-based formulation, while reducing computation time by more than an order of magnitude. The results confirm that the proposed approach provides a reliable and computationally lightweight framework for real-time safe control of parallel robotic systems. The experimental videos are available on the project website. (https://nail-uh.github.io/StewartPlatformSafeControl.github.io/)</description>

      <title>CORL: Reinforcement Learning of MILP Policies Solved via Branch and Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&amp;B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&amp;B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.</description>

      <title>Incremental Validation of Automated Driving Functions using Generic Volumes in Micro- Operational Design Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The validation of highly automated, perception-based driving systems must ensure that they function correctly under the full range of real-world conditions. Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics. These findings support the development of a standardised framework for safety argumentation and offer a practical step towards the validation and authorisation of automated driving functions.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides global attractivity results for the interior equilibrium point of a general Lotka-Volterra system with no restriction on the dimension of the system and with no special structure or properties of the interaction matrix. The main result contains as special cases all known general results, including the Volterra-Lyapunov theorem and the recently proposed eigenvector conditions. Moreover, global attractivity of the interior equilibrium point is shown for a three-dimensional example, where none of the existing general results can be applied.</description>

      <title>Safe Bayesian optimization across noise models via scenario programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes is an effective tool for tuning control policies in safety-critical real-world systems, specifically due to its sample efficiency and safety guarantees. However, most safe BO algorithms assume homoscedastic sub-Gaussian measurement noise, an assumption that does not hold in many relevant applications. In this article, we propose a straightforward yet rigorous approach for safe BO across noise models, including homoscedastic sub-Gaussian and heteroscedastic heavy-tailed distributions. We provide a high-probability bound on the measurement noise via the scenario approach, integrate these bounds into high probability confidence intervals, and prove safety and optimality for our proposed safe BO algorithm. We deploy our algorithm in synthetic examples and in tuning a controller for the Franka Emika manipulator in simulation.</description>

      <title>Architecting Large Action Models for Human-in-the-Loop Intelligent Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of intelligent robots, operating autonomously and interacting with other intelligent agents, human or artificial, requires the integration of environment perception, reasoning, and action. Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations. These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed light on the ongoing challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety in the field.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Surrogate Modeling for Closed-Loop Learning of Neural-Network-Parameterized Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning controller parameters from closed-loop data has been shown to improve closed-loop performance. Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Meta Distribution Reliability Analysis of Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication reliability, as defined by 3GPP, is the probability of achieving a desired quality of service (QoS). Traditionally, this metric is evaluated by averaging the QoS success indicator over spatiotemporal random variables. Recently, the meta distribution (MD) has emerged as a two-level analysis tool that characterizes system-level reliability as a function of link-level reliability thresholds. However, existing MD studies have two limitations. First, they focus exclusively on spatial and temporal randomness corresponding to node distribution and fading channels, respectively, leaving stochastic behaviors in other domains largely unexplored. Second, they are restricted to first-order MDs with two randomness levels, restricting applicability to scenarios requiring higher-order MD characterization. To address these gaps, we propose a hierarchical framework for higher-order MD reliability in wireless networks, where each layer's success probability is formulated and fed into the next layer, yielding overall MD reliability at the highest level. We apply this framework to wireless networks by capturing three levels of temporal dynamics representing fast, slow, and static random elements, and provide a comprehensive second-order MD reliability analysis for two application scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via these representative scenarios, supported by detailed analytical and numerical evaluations. Our results highlight the value of hierarchical MD representations across multiple domains and reveal the significant influence of inner-layer target reliabilities on overall performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of the Region of Attraction (RoA) for unknown autonomous dynamical systems. A data-driven approach based on the moment-Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is proposed, enabling novel RoA outer approximations despite the reduced information on the dynamics. The main contribution consists of bypassing the system model and, hence, the recurring constraint on its polynomial structure. Numerical experiments showcase the influence of data on learned approximating sets, highlighting the potential of this method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipativity is an input-output (IO) characterization of nonlinear systems that enables compositional robust control through Vidyasagar's Network Dissipativity Theorem (VDNT). However, determining the dissipativity of a system is an involved and, often, model-specific process. We present a general method to determine the local dissipativity properties of smooth, nonlinear, control affine systems. We simultaneously search for the optimal IO characterization of a system and synthesize a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) storage function via a convex optimization problem. To do so, we reformulate the dissipation inequality as a matrix inequality (MI) and develop novel linear matrix inequality (LMI) bounds for a triangulation to impose the dissipativity conditions on the CPA storage function Further, we develop a method to synthesize a combined quadratic and CPA storage function to expand the systems the optimization problem is applicable to. Finally, we establish that our method will always find a feasible IO characterization and storage function given that the system is sufficiently strictly locally dissipative and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in determining the conic bounds and gain of various nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A Highly Configurable Framework for Large-Scale Thermal Building Data Generation to drive Machine Learning Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of building thermal dynamics is emerging as an increasingly important field of research for large-scale intelligent building control. However, research in data-driven modeling using machine learning (ML) techniques requires massive amounts of thermal building data, which is not easily available. Neither empirical public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of ML research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building simulation. To fill this gap, we present a thermal building data generation framework which we call BuilDa. BuilDa is designed to produce synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for ML research. The framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for a transfer learning study involving the fine-tuning of 486 data-driven models.</description>

Abstract: Robots require full-body, high-resolution tactile sensing to operate safely in unstructured environments, enabling reflexive responses and closed-loop control. However, the pixel counts needed for dense, large-area coverage limit readout rates of most tactile arrays to &lt;100 Hz, hindering their use in high-speed tasks. We present Adaptive Compressive Tactile Subsampling (ACTS), a scalable and data-driven method that greatly enhances traditional tactile matrices by leveraging adaptive sensor sampling and sparse recovery. By adaptively allocating measurements to informative regions, ACTS is especially effective for spatially sparse signals common in real-world interactions. Tested on a 1024-pixel tactile sensor array (32x32), ACTS achieved frame rates up to 1,000 Hz, an 18X improvement over conventional raster scanning, with minimal reconstruction error. For the first time, ACTS enables wearable, large-area, high-density tactile sensing systems that can deliver high-speed results. We demonstrate rapid object classification within 20 ms of contact, high-speed projectile detection, ricochet angle estimation, and soft deformation tracking, in tactile and robotics applications, all using flexible, high-density tactile arrays. These include high-resolution tactile gloves, pressure insoles, and full-body configurations covering robotic arms and human-sized mannequins. We further showcase tactile-based closed-loop control by guiding a metallic ball to trace letters using tactile feedback and by executing tactile-only whole-hand reflexes on a fully sensorized LEAP hand to stabilize grasps, prevent slip, and avoid sharp objects, validating ACTS for real-time interaction and motion control. ACTS transforms standard, low-cost, and robust tactile sensors into high-speed systems enabling scalable, responsive, and adaptive tactile perception for robots and wearables operating in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair.
  A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies.
  By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</description>

      <title>Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES) for AI-assisted RFIC and Microwave Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21274</link>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel analytical framework, termed the Multiport Analytical Pixel Electromagnetic Simulator (MAPES). MAPES enables efficient and accurate prediction of the electromagnetic (EM) performance of arbitrary pixel-based microwave (MW) and RFIC structures. Inspired by the Integrated Internal Multiport Method (IMPM), MAPES extends the concept to the pixel presence/absence domain used in AI-assisted EM design. By introducing virtual pixels and diagonal virtual pixels and inserting virtual ports at critical positions, MAPES captures all horizontal, vertical, and diagonal electromagnetic couplings within a single multiport impedance matrix. Only a small set of full-wave simulations (typically about 1% of the datasets required by AI-assisted EM simulators) is needed to construct this matrix. Subsequently, any arbitrary pixel configuration can be evaluated analytically using a closed-form multiport relation without additional full-wave calculations. The proposed approach eliminates data-driven overfitting and ensures accurate results across all design variations. Comprehensive examples for single- and double-layer CMOS processes (180 nm and 65 nm) and PCBs confirm that MAPES achieves high prediction accuracy with 600- 2000x speed improvement compared to CST simulations. Owing to its efficiency, scalability and reliability, MAPES provides a practical and versatile tool for AI-assisted MW circuit and RFIC design across diverse fabrication technologies.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Rate of Stochastic Control Systems</title>

Abstract: This paper develops a quantitative framework for analyzing the mean-square exponential stabilization of stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise, focusing specifically on the optimal stabilizing rate, which characterizes the fastest exponential stabilization achievable under admissible control policies. Our contributions are twofold. First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise.</description>

      <title>Linear Quadratic Regulators: A New Look</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear time-invariant control systems can be considered as finitely generated modules over the commutative principal ideal ring $\mathbb{R}[\frac{d}{dt}]$ of linear differential operators with respect to the time derivative. The Kalman controllability in this algebraic language is translated as the freeness of the system module. Linear quadratic regulators rely on quadratic Lagrangians, or cost functions. Any flat output, i.e., any basis of the corresponding free module leads to an open-loop control strategy via an Euler-Lagrange equation, which becomes here a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which is known to exhibit excellent performance concerning model mismatches and disturbances.</description>
