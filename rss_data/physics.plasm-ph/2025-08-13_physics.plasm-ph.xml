      <title>A High-Order Low-Order extended moment method for the Vlasov-Darwin particle-in-cell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop an extended implicit moment method, namely, a coupled high-order low-order (HOLO) method and apply it to the electromagnetic Vlasov-Darwin model. The high-order (HO) system evolves particles in a manner that conserves charge, energy, and canonical momentum, while the low-order (LO) system solves the fluid moment and Darwin equations, acting as an algorithmic convergence accelerator to the HO system. We demonstrate the HOLO method's ability to take timesteps far larger than the explicit limit, and accurately recover the system's evolution so long as its dynamical timescale is respected. Also, we find that the choice of LO fluid moment equations has a strong impact on the nonlinear convergence of the coupled particle-field system. The HOLO algorithm is benchmarked against electrostatic Landau damping and the electromagnetic electron and ion Weibel instabilities.</description>

      <title>Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\sigma \gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\sigma &lt; 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of monotonic sheaths near a wall with grazing magnetic incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a magnetised plasma in contact with an absorbing planar wall, where the angle $\alpha$ between the magnetic field and the wall is small, $\alpha \ll 1$ (in radians) and the system is symmetric tangential to the wall. The finite ratio $\gamma$ of the characteristic electron gyroradius $\rho_{\rm e}$ to the Debye length $\lambda_{\rm D}$, $\gamma = \rho_{\rm e} / \lambda_{\rm D}$, is retained via a grazing-incidence ($\alpha \ll 1$) gyrokinetic treatment [1,2]. Building on a previously developed iterative scheme [2,3] to solve for the steady-state electrostatic potential in the quasineutral magnetic presheath of width $\sim \rho_{\rm S}$, we developed a scheme that simultaneously solves for both the presheath and the non-neutral Debye sheath of width $\sim \lambda_{\rm D}$ in the limit $\lambda_{\rm D} / \rho_{\rm S} \rightarrow 0$. The code, called GYRAZE, thus provides the energy-angle distribution of ions at the wall and the velocity distributions of electrons reflected by the wall for different values of wall potential. A monotonic electrostatic potential profile, assumed in this work, can only exist for magnetic field angles larger than a critical value [3]. While the critical angle is shown here to significantly increase with $\gamma$, it is still typically smaller than the magnetic field angle at divertor targets of a fusion device.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Electron Heating in Electron-Only Reconnection in a Laboratory Mini-Magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09086v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of electron heating in electron-only magnetic reconnection in laser-driven laboratory mini-magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.</description>

      <title>Universal power-law distribution functions in an electromagnetic kinetic plasma: implications for the inverted temperature profile in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory for the relaxation of electromagnetic kinetic plasmas, and demonstrate that the mean distribution functions of both electrons and ions tend to relax to a universal $v^{-5}$ tail. Large-scale electromagnetic (EM) fields efficiently accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. This non-thermal tail may arise in the solar corona from EM turbulence despite collisions, allowing suprathermal particles to escape the sun's gravity (velocity filtration) and inverting the temperature $(T)$ profile with $T$ rising to $10^6$ K.</description>

      <title>Developing a Linear Fluid Plasma Model with Accurate Kinetic Bernstein Waves: A First Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic models provide highly accurate descriptions of plasma waves but involve complex integrals that are computationally expensive to solve. To facilitate a fluid-like treatment of the system, we propose rational approximations for both the plasma dispersion function in the parallel integral and the Bessel function in the perpendicular integral, ensuring that the system remains rational with respect to all three variables: wave frequency $\omega$, parallel wavevector $k_\parallel$, and perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$. By accurately approximating the Bessel function over a wide range of Larmor radius $\rho_{cs}$ values, from $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to 0$ to $k_\perp\rho_{cs} \to \infty$, we present an initial attempt to incorporate kinetic Bernstein waves into a fluid model. As an application, we employ this model to analyze { electromagnetic plasma} wave propagation conditions (i.e., accessibility) by solving for the complex perpendicular wavevector $k_\perp$ using a matrix eigenvalue method with given input parameters. This work may contribute to studies of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating in magnetized confinement plasmas.</description>

      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

      <title>A low-cost plasma source aimed for medical applications using Ar as the working gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to advances in equipment and intense research on plasma biomedical applications over the past few years, plasma devices are now suitable for clinical use. It has been demonstrated that plasma sources can be designed in a way that ensures their safe operation and application whilst preserving the relevant clinical results. However, the manufacturing and operating costs of such plasma devices remain high, which can be decisive for their adoption in medical procedures. In this work, a simple modification of a low-cost plasma jet configuration is proposed in order to evaluate the device's viability for medical applications using argon as working gas. Typically, plasma jets operating with argon (Ar) generate high electrical currents, which makes them unsuitable for medical applications. With the proposed device modification, the treatment is no longer carried out using the plasma jet directly, but rather with the post-discharge effluent enriched with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. As a result, the electrical current reaching the target remains below the safety threshold established for plasma applications in humans. Tests on water activation by plasma jets with and without the proposed modification indicate that both devices can yield comparable outcomes.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
