      <title>Berkeley Cardinals and Vop\v{e}nka's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "$n$-choiceless" supercompact and extendible cardinals in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice. We prove relations between these cardinals and Vop\v{e}nka's Principle similar to those of Bagaria's work in his papers "$C^{(n)}$-Cardinals" and "More on the Preservation of Large Cardinals Under Class Forcing." We use these relations to characterize Berkeley cardinals in terms of a restricted form of Vop\v{e}nka's Principle. Finally, we establish the equiconsistency of the "$n$-choiceless" extendible cardinals with their original counterparts, and study the consistency strength of other relevant theories.</description>

      <title>On forcing axioms and weakenings of the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove forcing axiom equivalents of two families of weakenings of the axiom of choice: a trichotomy principle for cardinals isolated by L\'evy, ${\rm H\hskip0.05pt}_\kappa$, and ${\rm DC}_\kappa$, the principle of dependent choices generalized to cardinals $\kappa$, for regular cardinals $\kappa$. Using these equivalents we obtain new forcing axiom formulations of the axiom of choice.
  A point of interest is that we use a new template for forcing axioms. For the class of forcings to which we asks that the axioms apply, we do not ask that they apply to all collections of dense sets of a certain cardinality, but rather only for each particular forcing to a specific family of dense sets of the cardinality in question.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued o-minimal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{R}_{\textrm{an},\exp}$-definable functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ that take integer values at all sufficiently large positive integers. If $|f(x)|= O\big(2^{(1+10^{-5})x}\big)$, then we find polynomials $P_1, P_2$ such that $f(x)=P_1(x)+P_2(x)2^x$ for all sufficiently large $x$. Our result parallels classical theorems of P\'olya and Selberg for entire functions and generalizes Wilkie's classification for the case of $|f(x)|= O(C^x)$, for some $C&lt;2$.
  Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\gamma_k=\sum_{j=1}^{k} 1/j$. Extending Wilkie's theorem in a separate direction, we show that if $f$ is $k$-$\textit{concordant}$ and $|f(x)|= O(C^{x})$, for some $C&lt;e^{\gamma_k}+1$, then $f$ must eventually be given by a polynomial. This is an analog of a result by Pila for entire functions.</description>

      <title>Benign approximations and non-speedability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A left-computable number $x$ is called regainingly approximable if there is a computable increasing sequence $(x_n)_n$ of rational numbers converging to $x$ such that $x - x_n &lt; 2^{-n}$ for infinitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$; and it is called nearly computable if there is such an $(x_n)_n$ such that for every computable increasing function $s \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ the sequence ${(x_{s(n+1)} - x_{s(n)})_n}$ converges computably to 0. In this article we study the relationship between both concepts by constructing on the one hand a non-computable number that is both regainingly approximable and nearly computable, and on the other hand a left-computable number that is nearly computable but not regainingly approximable; it then easily follows that the two notions are incomparable with non-trivial intersection. With this relationship clarified, we then hold the keys to answering an open question of Merkle and Titov: they studied speedable numbers, that is, left-computable numbers whose approximations can be sped up in a certain sense, and asked whether, among the left-computable numbers, being Martin-L\"of random is equivalent to being non-speedable. As we show that the concepts of speedable and regainingly approximable numbers are equivalent within the nearly computable numbers, our second construction provides a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Positive indiscernibles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalise various theorems for finding indiscernible trees and arrays to positive logic: based on an existing modelling theorem for s-trees, we prove modelling theorems for str-trees, str$_0$-trees (the reduct of str-trees that forgets the length comparison relation) and arrays. In doing so, we prove stronger versions for basing -- rather than locally basing or EM-basing -- str-trees on s-trees and str$_0$-trees on str-trees. As an application we show that a thick positive theory has $k$-TP$_2$ iff it has $2$-TP$_2$.</description>

      <title>Almost real closed fields with real analytic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cluckers and Lipshitz have shown that real closed fields equipped with real analytic structure are o-minimal. This generalizes the well-known subanalytic structure $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{an}}$ on the real numbers. We extend this line of research by investigating ordered fields with real analytic structure that are not necessarily real closed. When considered in a language with a symbol for a convex valuation ring, these structures turn out to be tame as valued fields: we prove that they are $\omega$-h-minimal. Additionally, our approach gives a precise description of the induced structure on the residue field and the value group, and naturally leads to an Ax--Kochen--Ersov-theorem for fields with real analytic structure.</description>

      <title>The Nikodym property and filters on $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a free filter $F$ on $\omega$, let $N_F=\omega\cup\{p_F\}$, where $p_F\not\in\omega$, be equipped with the following topology: every element of $\omega$ is isolated whereas all open neighborhoods of $p_F$ are of the form $A\cup\{p_F\}$ for $A\in F$. The aim of this paper is to study spaces of the form $N_F$ in the context of the Nikodym property of Boolean algebras. By $\mathcal{AN}$ we denote the class of all those ideals $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ such that for the dual filter $\mathcal{I}^*$ the space $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ carries a sequence $\langle\mu_n\colon n\in\omega\rangle$ of finitely supported signed measures such that $\|\mu_n\|\rightarrow\infty$ and $\mu_n(A)\rightarrow 0$ for every clopen subset $A\subseteq N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$. We prove that $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if there exists a density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $\mathcal{I}$ is contained in the exhaustive ideal $\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$. Consequently, we get that if $\mathcal{I}\subseteq\mbox{Exh}(\varphi)$ for some density submeasure $\varphi$ on $\omega$ such that $\varphi(\omega)=\infty$ and $N_{\mathcal{I}^*}$ is homeomorphic to a subspace of the Stone space $St(\mathcal{A})$ of a given Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ does not have the Nikodym property.
  We observe that each $\mathcal{I}\in\mathcal{AN}$ is Kat\v{e}tov below the asymptotic density zero ideal $\mathcal{Z}$, and prove that the class $\mathcal{AN}$ has a subset of size $\mathfrak{d}$ which is dominating with respect to the Kat\v{e}tov order $\leq_K$, but $\mathcal{AN}$ has no $\leq_K$-maximal element. We show that for a density ideal $\mathcal{I}$ it holds $\mathcal{I}\not\in\mathcal{AN}$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is totally bounded if and only if the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\omega)/\mathcal{I}$ contains a countable splitting family.</description>

      <title>Logic in Mathematics and Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logic has pride of place in mathematics and its 20th century offshoot, computer science. Modern symbolic logic was developed, in part, as a way to provide a formal framework for mathematics: Frege, Peano, Whitehead and Russell, as well as Hilbert developed systems of logic to formalize mathematics. These systems were meant to serve either as themselves foundational, or at least as formal analogs of mathematical reasoning amenable to mathematical study, e.g., in Hilbert's consistency program. Similar efforts continue, but have been expanded by the development of sophisticated methods to study the properties of such systems using proof and model theory. In parallel with this evolution of logical formalisms as tools for articulating mathematical theories (broadly speaking), much progress has been made in the quest for a mechanization of logical inference and the investigation of its theoretical limits, culminating recently in the development of new foundational frameworks for mathematics with sophisticated computer-assisted proof systems. In addition, logical formalisms developed by logicians in mathematical and philosophical contexts have proved immensely useful in describing theories and systems of interest to computer scientists, and to some degree, vice versa. Three examples of the influence of logic in computer science are automated reasoning, computer verification, and type systems for programming languages.</description>

      <title>Preservation Theorems Through the Lens of Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of topological spaces that captures the existence of preservation theorems. The structure of those spaces allows us to study the relativisation of preservation theorems under suitable definitions of surjective morphisms, subclasses, sums, products, topological closures, and projective limits. Throughout the paper, we also integrate already known results into this new framework and show how it captures th essence of their proofs.</description>
