      <title>Black Hole Solutions in Non-Minimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole solutions are found in the context of a non-minimal matter-curvature coupling with the Weyl connection, both in vacuum and in the presence of a cosmological constant-like matter content. This special case of non-metricity leads to black hole solutions with non-vanishing scalar curvature. Moreover, vacuum Schwarzschild solutions differ from the ones from a constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories with the appearance of a coefficient in the term linear in r and a corrected "cosmological constant". Non-vacuum Shwarzschild solutions have formally the same solutions as in the previous case with the exception being the physical interpretation of a cosmological constant as the source of the matter Lagrangian as not a simple reparametrization of the $f(R)$ description. Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions cannot be found in vacuum, but only in the presence of matter fields, such that the solutions also differ from the constant curvature scenario in $f(R)$ theories by the term linear in r and corrected/dressed charge and cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Comparison of $f(R,T)$ Gravity with Type Ia Supernovae Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of the universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity is studied. By focusing on functions of the form $f(R,T)=f_1(R)+f_2(T)$, we assert that present day acceleration can be achieved if the functional form of $f_2(T)$ either grows slowly or falls as a function of $T$. In particular, we demonstrate that when $f_2(T) \propto T^{-1}$, the universe transitions to exponential growth at late times, just as it does in the standard cosmological model. A comparison of predictions of this model, with Type Ia supernovae shows that this model fits the data as well or even slightly better than the standard cosmological model without increasing the number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Generalization of on-shell construction of Ricci-flat axisymmetric black holes from Schwazschild black holes via Newman-Janis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a specific issue of the Newman-Janis algorithm: determining the general form of the complex transformation for the Schwarzschild metric and ensuring that the resulting axisymmetric metric satisfies the Ricci-flat condition. We address a specific issue of the Newman-Janis algorithm: determining the general form of the complex transformation for the Schwarzschild metric and ensuring that the resulting axisymmetric metric satisfies the Ricci-flat condition. In this context, the Ricci-flat condition acts as the equation of motion, indicating that our discussion of the Newman-Janis algorithm operates "on-shell." Owing to the Ricci-flat condition, we refer to the class of black holes derived from the Schwarzschild metric through this algorithm as the "on-shell Newman-Janis class of Schwarzschild black holes" in order to emphasize Newman-Janis algorithm's potential as a classification tool for axisymmetric black holes. The general complex transformation we derive not only generates the Kerr, Taub-NUT, and Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes under specific choices of parameters but also suggests the existence of additional axisymmetric black holes. Our findings open an alternative avenue using the Newman-Janis algorithm for the on-shell construction of new axisymmetric black holes.</description>

      <title>Constructing Viable Interacting Dark Matter and Dark Energy Models: A Dynamical Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of $k=-1$ FLRW cosmological models for two interacting Dark Matter-Dark Energy Models using dynamical system analysis. Since we are interested in late time evolution, the sign of the interaction term is chosen such that it facilitates the transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. We also explore the $k=0$ invariant subspace of these models. We find that both these models have sectors which have a stable fixed point where we can recover an accelerating universe with a negative equation of state. This indicates these can be viable models for our universe. We also rule out certain sectors of these models because they do not give the correct late time observational features. We observe that although we start with a dust-like Dark Matter, its effective equation of state evolves due to its interaction with Dark Energy. As a result, the Dark Matter can display features of stiff matter and exotic matter in the course of evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Kiselev-AdS Black Holes within f (R, T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological charge and the conditions for the existence of the photon sphere (PS) in Kiselev-AdS black holes within \(f(R, T)\) gravity. We employ two different methods based on Duan's topological current \(\phi\)-mapping theory viz analize of temperature and the generalized Helmholtz free energy methods to study the topological classes of our black hole. By considering the mentioned black hole, we discuss the critical and zero points (topological charges and topological numbers) for different parameters. Our findings reveal that the Kiselev parameter \(\omega\) and the \(f(R, T)\) gravity parameter \(\gamma\) influence the number of topological charges of black holes, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. We observe that for given values of the free parameters, there exist total topological charges (\(Q_{total} = -1\)) for T-method and total topological numbers (\(W = +1\)) for the generalized Helmholtz free energy method. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario where \(\omega = 1/3\), in other cases, increasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of total topological charges for the black hole. Interestingly, for the phantom field (\(\omega = -4/3\)), we observed that decreasing the parameter \(\gamma\) increases the number of topological charges. Additionally, we study the results for the photon sphere. The studied models clearly reveal that the simultaneous presence of \(\gamma\) and \(\omega\) effectively expands the permissible range for \(\gamma\). In other words, the model can exhibit black hole behavior over a larger domain. Additionally, it is evident that with the stepwise reduction of \(\omega\), the region covered by singularity also diminishes and becomes more restricted. However, An interesting point about all three ranges is the elimination of the forbidden region in this model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of non-minimally coupled f(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experience some challenges in general gravitational theory owing to Einstein to explain late time acceleration of universe. To address this issue, geometric components of gravity have been modified in quite a few occasions to have a more general structure with some freedom. One such approach is to change the geometric components of gravity where gravitational interaction is denoted by Q,Q being the non-metricity. In our work, we have considered symmetric teleparallel gravity i.e, modified the geometry with the help of non-metricity Q or f(Q) gravity. We have considered a specific form of f(Q) which is nothing but the linear combination of Q and \alpha Q^{n}, n\neq 1, where Q is coupled with Lagrangian matter. Forming the autonomous system from governing equations and then solving it, we have tried to analyze the nature of universe using dynamical system analysis. We have studied the behavior of the universe under several circumstances. Then, we have studied the stability around critical points and considering the recent observational data available for some cosmological parameters, feasible solutions are noted which depict late time acceleration. We can see that f(Q) gravity model can be considered as an alternative model to \lambda CDM model.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on cosmological parameters in the Bianchi type III Universe with f(R,T) gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bianchi type III (BIII) metric is an interesting anisotropic model for studying cosmic anisotropy as it has an additional exponential term multiplied to a directional scale factor. Thus, the cosmological parameters obtained for this BIII metric with the conventional energy-momentum tensor within the framework of a modified gravity theory and the estimation of their values with the help of Hubble, Pantheon plus and other observational data may provide some new information in cosmic evolution. In this work, we have studied the BIII metric under the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity theory and estimated the values of the cosmological parameters for three different models of this gravity theory by using the Bayesian technique. In our study, we found that all the models show consistent results with the current observations but show deviations in the early stage of the Universe. In one model we have found a sharp discontinuity in the matter-dominated phase of the Universe. Hence through this study, we have found that all the $f(R,T)$ gravity models may not be suitable for studying evolutions and early stages of the Universe in the BIII metric even though they show consistent results with the current observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing of Euler-Heisenberg Black Hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitating lensing Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. This kind of black hole solution enables us to investigate the nontrivial interplay between the dark matter effects and nonlinear electrodynamics effects (or quantum electrodynamics effects). The important observable in gravitational lensing observations are calculated and discussed, including the gravitational deflection angle of light, time delay of light, precession angle of massive orbit's bound orbits, and black hole shadow radius. The results indicates that the Euler-Heisenberg black hole with a negative perfect fluid dark matter parameter ($\lambda_{\text{DM}} &lt; 0$) could greatly intensify the gravitational deflection angle of light, time delay of light and precession angle of massive object's bound orbit, while the nonlinear electrodynamics effects do not have large influences on these gravitational lensing observables.

      <title>Tidal response beyond vacuum General Relativity with a canonical definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal effects on compact objects provide profound theoretical insights into the structure of the field equations, and are wonderful probes of the equation of state of matter, the nature of black holes and of the underlying theory of gravity. The natural framework for understanding tides is a perturbative scheme. Here, we point out ambiguities in determining tidal response functions within such a framework, which may lead to bias in constraining physical parameters with gravitational-wave observations if the computed quantities are not properly linked to observables. We propose a Canonical Tidal Response Function (CTRF) definition to compare values of tides in theories beyond vacuum General Relativity in a unified manner. As an example, we provide black hole tidal response functions, including both conservative and dissipative pieces, in various theories of gravity. Tidal dissipation Love numbers for black holes are derived here for the first time in most of the non-Einsteinian theories considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>A Tetrad-First Approach to Robust Numerical Algorithms in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>Analyzing black-hole ringdowns II: data conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics using high precision absorption spectroscopy; continuum placement uncertainties and the fine structure constant in strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>Towards a new generation of reflection models for precision measurements of accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blurred reflection features are commonly observed in the X-ray spectra of accreting black holes. In the presence of high-quality data and with the correct astrophysical model, X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the strong gravity region of black holes, study the morphology of the accreting matter, measure black hole spins, and test Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In the past 10-15 years, there has been significant progress in the development of the analysis of these reflection features, thanks to both more sophisticated theoretical models and new observational data. However, the next generation of X-ray missions (e.g. eXTP, Athena, HEX-P) promises to provide unprecedented high-quality data, which will necessarily require more accurate synthetic reflection spectra than those available today. In this talk, I will review the state-of-the-art in reflection modeling and I will present current efforts to develop a new generation of reflection models with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative (NC) models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent $\kappa$ and $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformations in space-time and fourmomenta sectors. The first quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and fourmomenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining one of nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$ deformations. The second model is provided by the non-linear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$ describing the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term.</description>

      <title>Energy-Morawetz estimates for the wave equation in perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove energy and Morawetz estimates for solutions to the scalar wave equation in spacetimes with metrics that are perturbations, compatible with nonlinear applications, of Kerr metrics in the full subextremal range. Central to our approach is the proof of a global in time energy-Morawetz estimate conditional on a low frequency control of the solution using microlocal multipliers adapted to the $r$-foliation of the spacetime. This result constitutes a first step towards extending the current proof of Kerr stability in \cite{GCM1} \cite{GCM2} \cite{KS:Kerr} \cite{GKS} \cite{Shen}, valid in the slowly rotating case, to a complete resolution of the black hole stability conjecture, i.e., the statement that the Kerr family of spacetimes is nonlinearly stable for all subextremal angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of charged quantum de-Sitter$_{3}$ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct charged, static black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS$_{3}$) space that exactly account for semi-classical backreaction effects due to quantum conformal matter. This is accomplished using braneworld holography, where an accelerating, electrically charged anti-de Sitter$_{4}$ black hole localizes on a Randall-Sundrum end-of-the-world brane. Absent of backreaction, the black hole disappears, leaving a chemical conical defect. The "quantum" black hole has a physical parameter space characterized by a shark-fin diagram, with extremal, Nariai, and ultracold limits. We give a detailed analysis of the horizon thermodynamics, where we find the heat capacity of charged and neutral dS$_{3}$ black holes features Schottky peaks. In particular, for a specific temperature range, charged quantum black holes behave as thermal systems with a finite number of energy levels available to their underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, beyond which many energy levels become available. Finally, we compute the probability of nucleating quantum dS black holes. Our work gives a first step to study quantum matter backreaction effects on dS black hole decay.</description>

      <title>Long-term Monte Carlo based neutrino-radiation viscous-hydrodynamics simulations for a merger remnant black hole-torus system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our new general relativistic Monte Carlo (MC)-based neutrino radiation hydrodynamics code designed to solve axisymmetric systems with several improvements. The main improvements are as follows: (i) the development of an extended version of the implicit MC method for multi-species radiation fields; (ii) modeling of neutrino pair process rates based on a new numerically efficient and asymptotically correct fitting function for the kernel function; (iii) the implementation of new numerical limiters on the radiation-matter interaction to ensure a stable and physically correct evolution of the system. We apply our code to a black hole (BH)-torus system with a BH mass of $3\,M_\odot$, BH dimmensionless spin of 0.8, and a torus mass of $0.1\,M_\odot$, which mimics a post-merger remnant of a binary neutron star merger in the case that the massive neutron star collapses to a BH within a short time scale ($\sim10\,{\rm ms}$). We follow the evolution of the BH-torus system up to more than $1\,{\rm s}$ with our MC-based radiation viscous-hydrodynamics code that dynamically takes into account non-thermal pair process. We find that the system evolution and the various key quantities, such as neutrino luminosity, ejecta mass, torus $Y_e$, and pair annihilation luminosity, are broadly in agreement with the results of the previous studies. We also find that the $\nu_e{\bar \nu}_e$ pair annihilation can launch a relativistic outflow for a time scale of $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$, and it can be energetic enough to explain some of short-hard gamma-ray bursts and the precursors. Finally, we calculate the indicators of the fast flavor instability directly from the obtained neutrino distribution functions, which indicate that the instability can occur particularly near the equatorial region of the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use digital quantum computing to simulate the creation of particles in a dynamic spacetime. We consider a system consisting of a minimally coupled massive quantum scalar field in a spacetime undergoing homogeneous and isotropic expansion, transitioning from one stationary state to another through a brief inflationary period. We simulate two vibration modes, positive and negative for a given field momentum, by devising a quantum circuit that implements the time evolution. With this circuit, we study the number of particles created after the universe expands at a given rate, both by simulating the circuit and by actual experimental implementation on IBM quantum computers, consisting of hundreds of quantum gates. We find that state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques are useful to improve the estimation of the number of particles and the fidelity of the state.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the missing mass of galaxy clusters in MOND: the view from gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) has long been known to fail in galaxy clusters, implying a residual missing mass problem for clusters in this context. Here, using mass profiles derived from strong- and weak-lensing shear, as well as magnification data, for a sample of clusters from the CLASH survey, we characterize the density profile of this residual MOND missing mass in the central Mpc of galaxy clusters. In line with results obtained in the literature from the hydrostatic equilibrium of hot gas, we find that an inner constant density core and an outer power-law slope between $-4$ and $-6$ provides a good description within $\sim 1$ Mpc. We also show that the data in the central parts of clusters can be even better represented by a `dark mass-follows-gas' profile with an exponential cut-off. Clusters with X-ray emitting gas masses $M_\text{gas} \geq 10^{14}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ display a remarkable uniformity for the missing-to-hot-gas density ratio in the inner parts, of order $\sim$10, and for the exponential cut-off radius, of order $\sim 450$ kpc. Clusters with lower observed gas mass display larger and more scattered values for both the density ratio and cut-off radius. These lensing results can in principle serve as a crucible for relativistic theories of MOND in galaxy clusters, or for any other tentative hypothesis regarding the nature of the clusters residual missing mass in the MOND context.</description>

      <title>Adaptive asymptotic solutions of inflationary models in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism: Application to T-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05650v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute the slow-roll expansion for the Hubble parameter in inflationary models in a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime that is applicable to a wide class of potentials including monomial, polynomial, or rational functions of the inflaton, as well as polynomial or rational functions of the exponential of the inflaton. The method, formulated within the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, adapts the form of the slow-roll expansion to the analytic form of the inflationary potential, thus allowing a consistent order-by-order computation amenable to Pad\'e summation. Using T-models as an example, we show that Pad\'e summation extends the domain of validity of this adapted slow-roll expansion to the end of inflation. Likewise, Pad\'e summation extends the domain of validity of kinetic-dominance asymptotic expansions of the Hubble parameter into the fast-roll regime, where they can be matched to the aforesaid Pad\'e-summed slow-roll expansions. This matching in turn determines the relation between the expansions for the number $N$ of e-folds and allows us to compute the total amount of inflation as a function of the initial data or, conversely, to select initial data that correspond to a fixed total amount of inflation. Using the slow-roll stage expansions, we also derive expansions for the corresponding spectral index $n_s$ accurate to order $1/N^2$, and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ accurate to order $1/N^3$ for these T-models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study covariant models for vacuum spherical gravity within a canonical setting. Starting from a general ansatz, we derive the most general family of Hamiltonian constraints that are quadratic in first-order and linear in second-order spatial derivatives of the triad variables, and obey certain specific covariance conditions. These conditions ensure that the dynamics generated by such family univocally defines a spacetime geometry, independently of gauge or coordinates choices. This analysis generalizes the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity, though keeping intact the covariance of the theory, and leads to a rich variety of new geometries. We find that the resulting geometries depend on seven free functions of one scalar variable, and we study their generic features. By construction, there are no propagating degrees of freedom in the theory. However, we also show that it is possible to add matter to the system by simply following the usual minimal-coupling prescription, which leads to novel models to describe dynamical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Based on the recent work [1,2], we formulate the first law and the second law of stochastic thermodynamics in the framework of general relativity. These laws are established for a charged Brownian particle moving in a heat reservoir and subjecting to an external electromagnetic field in generic stationary spacetime background, and in order to maintain general covariance, they are presented respectively in terms of the divergences of the energy current and the entropy density current. The stability of the equilibrium state is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>NEC violation in $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity in the context of a non-canonical theory via modified Raychaudhuri equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop the Raychaudhuri equation in $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity in the setting of a non-canonical theory, namely K-essence theory. We solve the modified Raychaudhuri equation for the additive form of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$, which is $f_{1}(\bar{R})+f_{2}(\bar{T})$. For this solution, we employ two different scale factors to give two types of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ solutions. The ongoing debate between Fisher et. al. and Harko et. al. in 2020 regarding the additive form of $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ may provide a resolution within the modified $f(\bar{R},\bar{T})$ gravity theory. By conducting a viability test and analyzing energy conditions, we have determined that in the first scenario, the null energy condition (NEC) is violated between two regions where the NEC is satisfied. Additionally, we have observed that this violation of the NEC exhibits a symmetric property during the phase transition. These observations indicate that bouncing events may occur as a result of the symmetrical violation of the NEC during the expansion of the universe. Moreover, this model indicates that resonant-type quantum tunneling may take place during the period when the NEC is violated. The findings of NEC violation through the power law of scale factor may have empirical relevance in contemporary observations. In the second scenario, our model indicates that the strong energy condition is violated, but the NEC and weak energy conditions are satisfied. The effective energy density decreases and is positive, while the effective pressure and equation of state parameters are negative. This suggests that the universe is expanding with acceleration and is dominated by dark energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Big-Bounce as a phenomenology of RQM in the Mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a quantum Big-Bounce in the context of an isotropic Universe, filled by a self-interacting scalar field, which plays the role of a physical clock. The bouncing cosmology is the result of a scattering process, driven by the scalar field potential, which presence breaks down the frequency separation of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, treated in strict analogy to a relativistic quantum system. Differently from previous analyses, we consider a really perturbative self-interaction potential, affecting the dynamics in a finite range of the time labeled by the scalar clock (and in particular we remove the divergent character previously allowed). The main result of the present analysis is that, when the Relativistic Quantum Mechanics formalism is properly implemented in the Mini-superspace analogy, the probability amplitude for the bounce is, both in the standard and polymerized case, characterized by a maximum in correspondence of the quasi-classical condition of a Universe minimum volume.</description>

      <title>Free-falling motion of an elastic rigid rod towards a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the motion of an elastic rigid rod which is radially free-falling towards a Schwarzschild black hole. This is accomplished by reducing the corresponding free-boundary PDE problem to a sequence of ODEs, which we integrate numerically. Starting with a rod at rest, we show that it is possible to choose its initial compression profile so that its midpoint falls substantially faster, or slower, than a free-falling particle with the same initial conditions. This seems to be a purely kinematic effect, since on average there is no net transfer of elastic to mechanical energy.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes, thermodynamics and shadow of black holes in Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity theory</title>

Abstract: We derive novel black hole solutions in a modified gravity theory, namely the Hu-Sawicki model of $f(R)$ gravity. After obtaining the black hole solution, we study the horizon radius of the black hole from the metric and then analyse the dependence of the model parameters on the horizon. We then use the 6th-order WKB method to study the quasinormal modes of oscillations (QNMs) of the black hole perturbed by a scalar field. The dependence of the amplitude and damping part of the QNMs are analysed with respect to variations in model parameters and the errors associated with the QNMs are also computed. After that, we study some thermodynamic properties associated with the black hole such as its thermodynamic temperature as well as greybody factors. It is found that the black hole has the possibility of showcasing negative temperatures. We also analyse the geodesics and derive the photon sphere radius as well as the shadow radius of the black hole. The photon radius is independent of the model parameters while the shadow radius showed a fair amount of dependence on the model parameters. We tried to constrain the parameters with the help of Keck and VLTI observational data and obtained some bounds on $m$ and $c_{2}$ parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bonanno et al. (2024) presented an explicit metric describing the exterior of a collapsing dust ball within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. Based on this metric, we investigate in detail the properties of the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra for test massless scalar, vector, and Dirac fields. We find accurate values for the fundamental QNM frequency and the first overtones, demonstrating the appearance of a peculiar spiral-like behavior of the overtones compared to the fundamental modes. Additionally, we study black hole shadows and show that they align with EHT observations. Finally, we study the grey-body factors and provide explicit lower bound estimates.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars: The massive scalar field scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze numerically the dynamical transition to spontaneous scalarization in neutron stars in the framework of a scalar-tensor theory of gravity where the scalar field is free but massive, and it is coupled nonminimally to gravity in the Jordan frame. We show that the quasistatic configuration of the star that settles after the transition can avoid the observational constraints imposed on the amount of scalarization by several observations in binary systems due to the presence of the mass term, which suppresses the range of the scalar field. We also study the impact of the scalar field mass on the total mass of the star relative to the massless scenario.</description>

Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in Modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ Gravity: A Late Time Cosmic Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method for numerically solving the Friedmann equations of modified $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity in the presence of pressureless matter. This method enables us to predict the redshift behavior of the Hubble expansion rate. To evaluate the credibility of the model, we applied a Bayesian MCMC technique using late-time cosmic observations to impose limitations on the free parameters of the Gauss-Bonnet model. Our results suggest that the $f(\mathcal{G})$ model can reproduce the low-redshift behavior of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but there are significant differences at high redshifts, leading to the absence of a standard matter-dominated epoch. We also examined the profiles of cosmographic parameters using the model parameter values from the standard range to verify the intermediate epochs. Our analysis shows that the highly promising $f(\mathcal{G})$ model is a feasible candidate for explaining the current epochs. We presented a dynamical system analysis framework to examine the stability of the model. Our study identified critical points depicting various phases of the Universe and explained the evolutionary epochs. We demonstrated that the model effectively captures the evolution of energy components over cosmic time, supporting its validity as an alternate explanation for the observed acceleration of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting scalar dark matter around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves can provide crucial insights about the environments in which black holes live. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations to study the behaviour of self-interacting scalar (wave-like) dark matter clouds accreting onto isolated and binary black holes. We find that repulsive self-interactions smoothen the ``spike'' of an isolated black hole and saturate the density. Attractive self-interactions enhance the growth and result in more cuspy profiles, but can become unstable and undergo explosions akin to the superradiant bosenova that reduce the local cloud density. We quantify the impact of self-interactions on an equal-mass black hole merger by computing the dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal for a range of couplings. We find that repulsive self-interactions saturate the density of the cloud, thereby reducing the dephasing. For attractive self-interactions, the dephasing may be larger, but if these interactions dominate prior to the merger, the dark matter can undergo bosenova during the inspiral phase, disrupting the cloud and subsequently reducing the dephasing.</description>

      <title>Generating cosmological perturbations in non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a concrete model of Horndeski bounce with strong gravity in the past. Within this model we show that the correct spectra of cosmological perturbations may be generated at early contracting epoch, with mild fine-tuning ensuring that the scalar spectral tilt $n_S$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with observations. The smallness of $r$ is governed by the smallness of the scalar sound speed. Arbitrarily small values of $r$ are forbidden in our setup because of the strong coupling in the past. Nevertheless, we show that it is possible to generate perturbations in a controllable way, i.e. in the regime where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory.</description>

      <title>K-inflation: the legitimacy of classical treatment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a general theory of k-inlation and find out, that it may be in strong coupling regime. We derive accurate conditions of classical description validity using unitarity bounds for this model. Next, we choose simple toy model of k-inflation and obtain the explicit condition, which guarantees that the generation of perturbations is performed in a controllable way, i.e the exit from the effective horizon occurs in the weak coupling regime. However, for the same toy model the corresponding experimental bounds on a non-linear parameter $f^{\text{equil}}_{\text{NL}}$ associated with non-Gaussianities of the curvature perturbation provide much stronger constraint than strong coupling absence condition. Nevertheless, for other known models of inflation this may not be the case. Generally, one should always check if classical description is legitimate for chosen models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Weaving the (AdS) spaces with partial entanglement entropy threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we propose a general scheme for reconstructing bulk geometric quantities in a static pure AdS background using the partial entanglement entropy (PEE), a measure of the entanglement structure on the boundary CFT. The PEE between any two points $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ serves as the fundamental building block of the PEE structure. Following \cite{Lin:2023rbd}, we geometrize any two-point PEE $\mathcal{I}(\vec{x}, \vec{y})$ by the bulk geodesic connecting two boundary points $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$, which we call the PEE thread, with the density of the threads determined by the boundary PEE structure. In the AdS bulk, the set of all the PEE threads forms a continuous ``network'', which we call the PEE network.
  In this paper, we show that the density of the PEE threads passing through any bulk point is exactly $1/(4G)$. Based on this observation we give a complete reformulation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for a generic boundary region in general dimensional Poincar\'e AdS space. More explicitly, for any static boundary region $A$, the homologous surface $\Sigma_{A}$ that has the minimal number of intersections with the bulk PEE network is exactly the RT surface of $A$, and the minimal number of intersections reproduces the holographic entanglement entropy. The reconstruction for the area of bulk geometric quantities by counting the number of intersections with the bulk PEE network applies to generic bulk geometric quantities. Interestingly, this reconstruction indicates a pure geometric statement, which is exactly the so-called \emph{Crofton formula} in Poincar\'e AdS.</description>

      <title>Decoherence by warm horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Danielson, Satishchandran, and Wald (DSW) have shown that quantum superpositions held outside of Killing horizons will decohere at a steady rate. This occurs because of the inevitable radiation of soft photons (gravitons), which imprint a electromagnetic (gravitational) ``which-path'' memory onto the horizon. Rather than appealing to this global description, an experimenter ought to also have a local description for the cause of decoherence. One might intuitively guess that this is just the bombardment of Hawking/Unruh radiation on the system, however simple calculations challenge this idea -- the same superposition held in a finite temperature inertial laboratory does not decohere at the DSW rate. In this work we provide a local description of the decoherence by mapping the DSW set-up onto a worldline-localized model resembling an Unruh-DeWitt particle detector. We present an interpretation in terms of random local forces which do not sufficiently self-average over long times. Using the Rindler horizon as a concrete example we clarify the crucial role of temperature, and show that the Unruh effect is the only quantum mechanical effect underlying these random forces. A general lesson is that for an environment which induces Ohmic friction on the central system (as one gets from the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force, in an accelerating frame) the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies that when this environment is at finite temperature it will cause steady decoherence on the central system. Our results agree with DSW and provide the complementary local perspective.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering and Beyond from Extreme Mass Ratio Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.</description>
