      <title>Electrically Poled Vapor-Deposited Organic Glasses for Integrated Electro-Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce electrically-poled small molecule assemblies that can serve as the active electro-optic material in nano-scale guided-wave circuits such as those of the silicon photonics platform. These monolithic organic materials can be vacuum-deposited to homogeneously fill nanometer-size integrated-optics structures, and electrically poled at higher temperatures to impart an orientational non-centrosymmetric order that remains stable at room temperature. An initial demonstration using the DDMEBT molecule and corona poling delivered a material with the required high optical quality, an effective glass transition temperature of the order of $\sim 80$ $^\circ$C, and an electro-optic coefficient of $20$~pm/V.</description>

      <title>Imaging Local Effects of Voltage and Boron Doping on Spin Reversal in Antiferromagnetic Magnetoelectric Cr2O3 Thin Films and Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromia (Cr2O3) is a magnetoelectric oxide which permits voltage-control of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, but it suffers technological constraints due to its low Neel Temperature (TN ~307 K) and the need of a symmetry breaking applied magnetic field to achieve reversal of the Neel vector. Recently, boron (B) doping of Cr2O3 films led to an increase TN &gt; 400 K and allowed the realization of voltage magnetic-field free controlled N\'eel vector rotation. Here, we directly image the impact of B doping on the formation of AFM domains in Cr2O3 thin films and elucidate the mechanism of voltage-controlled manipulation of the spin structure using nitrogen vacancy (NV) scanning probe magnetometry. We find a stark reduction and thickness dependence of domain size in B-doped Cr2O3 (B:Cr2O3) films, explained by the increased germ density, likely associated with the B doping. By reconstructing the surface magnetization from the NV stray-field maps, we find a qualitative distinction between the undoped and B-doped Cr2O3 films, manifested by the histogram distribution of the AFM ordering, i.e., 180 degree domains for pure films, and 90 degree domains for B:Cr2O3 films. Additionally, NV imaging of voltage-controlled B-doped Cr2O3 devices corroborate the 90 degeree rotation of the AFM domains observed in magnetotransport measurement.</description>

      <title>Impact of Polymeric precursor and Auto-combustion on the Structural, Microstructural, Magnetic, and Magnetocaloric Properties of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSMO) nanopowders are synthesized using two different methods: Pechini (LSMO-PC) and auto-combustion (LSMO-AC). Nanoparticle sizes, structural, magnetic, and magnetocaloric properties were determined and compared. The X-ray diffraction confirms the coexistence of two phases; rhombohedral symmetry with space group R-3c and orthorhombic symmetry with space group Pbnm, with the rhombohedral phase dominating. The scanning electron microscope images show that LSMO-PC has larger nanoparticle sizes (~495 nm) than LSMO-AC (~195 nm). The samples exhibit ferromagnetic properties with distinct hysteresis loops and Curie temperatures 340 K and 290 K for LSMO-PC and LSMO-AC respectively. The variation of the magnetic entropy was measured indirectly using the Maxwell approach with increasing magnetic field. For LSMO-PC it reaches a maximum -dSM=1.69 J/kg.K at 340 K and dH= 5 T. The associated adiabatic temperature change dTM is 1.04 K. While LSMO-PC demonstrates superior magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, LSMO-AC displays significant magnetocaloric thermal stability. The obtained values make LSMO-PC and LSMO-AC promising candidates for eco-friendly room-temperature magnetocaloric applications.</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic landscape in kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and competition with family of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (Ln: Tb-Lu) shurikagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, the smallest rare-earth containing member of the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ family. We previously reported on the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ (Ln: La-Gd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{2+}$, Yb$^{2+}$) kagome metals. This structure type represents a magnetically diverse and exfoliable family of kagome metals. Detailed characterization of the magnetic and electronic transport properties of TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ reveals a highly complex landscape of magnetic phases arising from an antiferromagnetic ground state. A series of metamagnetic transitions creates at least 5 unique phase pockets, including a 1/3 and 2/3 magnetization plateau. Further, the system exhibits an intimate connection between the magnetism and magnetotransport, exhibiting sharp switching from positive (+40%) to negative magnetoresistance (-50%) near a metamagnetic transition. Unlike the Lu-Gd analogs, TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$ cannot be synthesized by the methodology presented previously due to phase competition with another, unreported class of materials, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ (x$\sim$1.7-1.2) (Ln: Tb--Lu) shurikagome metals. Like the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ kagome metals, the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family exhibits quasi-2D networks of titanium and chains of rare-earth. We present the structures and some select basic properties of the Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ family alongside the newly discovered TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. A discussion regarding the phase competition between the LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$ families helps frame the difficulty in synthesizing LnTi$_3$Bi$_4$ compounds with small \textit{Ln} species and provides a strategy to circumvent formation of Ln$_{2-x}$Ti$_{6+x}$Bi$_9$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-guided data-driven discovery of native quantum defects in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on their atomically thin structure, two-dimensional (2D) materials present a groundbreaking avenue for the precision fabrication and systematic manipulation of quantum defects. Through a method grounded in site-symmetry principles, we devise a comprehensive workflow to pinpoint potential native quantum defects across the entire spectrum of known binary 2D materials. Leveraging both symmetry principles and data-driven approaches markedly enhances the identification of spin defects exhibiting triplet ground states. This advancement is pivotal in discovering NV-like quantum defects in 2D materials, which are instrumental in facilitating a set of quantum functionalities. For discerning the multifaceted functionalities of these quantum defect candidates, their magneto-optical properties are comprehensively estimated using high-throughput computations. Our findings underscore that antisite defects in diverse hosts emerge as prospective quantum defects of significance. Crucially, based on our research, we advocate that the 16 antisites present in post-transition metal monochalcogenides (PTMCs) stand out as a prominent 2D-material-based quantum defect platforms, by their precise defect levels, optimal magneto-optical attributes, and the readily accessible nature of their host materials. This work substantially broadens the repertoire of quantum defects within the 2D material landscape, presenting profound implications for the advancement of quantum information science and technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical materials discovery and design with federated databases and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial and guided screening of materials space with density-functional theory and related approaches has provided a wealth of hypothetical inorganic materials, which are increasingly tabulated in open databases. The OPTIMADE API is a standardised format for representing crystal structures, their measured and computed properties, and the methods for querying and filtering them from remote resources. Currently, the OPTIMADE federation spans over 20 data providers, rendering over 30 million structures accessible in this way, many of which are novel and have only recently been suggested by machine learning-based approaches. In this work, we outline our approach to non-exhaustively screen this dynamic trove of structures for the next-generation of optical materials. By applying MODNet, a neural network-based model for property prediction, within a combined active learning and high-throughput computation framework, we isolate particular structures and chemistries that should be most fruitful for further theoretical calculations and for experimental study as high-refractive-index materials. By making explicit use of automated calculations, federated dataset curation and machine learning, and by releasing these publicly, the workflows presented here can be periodically re-assessed as new databases implement OPTIMADE, and new hypothetical materials are suggested.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in Dilute Hydrides of Ammonia under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been great progress in predicting and synthesizing polyhydrides that exhibit superconductivity when squeezed. Dopants allow these compounds to become metals at pressures lower than those required to metallize elemental hydrogen. Here, we show that by combining the fundamental planetary building blocks of molecular hydrogen and ammonia, conventional superconducting compounds can be formed at high pressure. Through extensive theoretical calculations we predict metallic metastable structures with NH$_n$ ($n=10,11,24$) stoichiometries that are based on NH$_4^+$ superalkali cations and complex hydrogenic lattices. The hydrogen atoms in the molecular cation contribute to the superconducting mechanism, and the estimated superconducting critical temperatures, $T_\text{c}$s, are comparable to the highest values computed for the alkali metal polyhydrides. The largest calculated (isotropic Eliashberg) $T_\text{c}$ is 179~K for $Pnma$-NH$_{10}$ at 300~GPa. Our results suggest that other molecular cations can be mixed with hydrogen under pressure yielding superconducting compounds.</description>

      <title>Structural properties, dielectric relaxation and impedance spectroscopy of NASICON type Na$_{3+x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Pr$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric and impedance spectroscopic investigation of Pr-doped NASICON type Na$_{3+x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Pr$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.05--0.2) samples as a function of temperature and frequency. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray diffraction patterns confirms the monoclinic phase having C2/c space groups for all the samples. The scanning electron microscopy shows the granular-like structure and energy dispersive x-ray analysis confirms the desired compositions. The temperature (90--400~K) and frequency (20 Hz-2 MHz) dependence of electric permittivity are explained using Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization and space charge polarization mechanisms. The dielectric relaxation shows nearly equal activation energy for all the samples with a non-Debye type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The complex impedance analysis shows the presence of broad grain and grain boundary relaxation peaks. The stretched exponent analysis of electric modulus using the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) function further confirms the non-Debye type of relaxation. Moreover, scaling analysis of the electric modulus shows a similar type of relaxation for all the samples. The {\it a.c.} conductivity data are fitted using modified power law, where the temperature dependence of exponent ($s$) confirms the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) type conduction for all the samples. Our results indicate that the Pr doped NASICON samples are potential candidates for charge storage devices due to their large electric permittivity.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multiferroicity in Single-Layer CuCrSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic materials, which simultaneously exhibit ferroelectricity and magnetism, have attracted substantial attention due to their fascinating physical properties and potential technological applications. With the trends towards device miniaturization, there is an increasing demand for the persistence of multiferroicity in single-layer materials at elevated temperatures. Here, we report high-temperature multiferroicity in single-layer CuCrSe$_2$, which hosts room-temperature ferroelectricity and 120 K ferromagnetism. Notably, the ferromagnetic coupling in single-layer CuCrSe$_2$ is enhanced by the ferroelectricity-induced orbital shift of Cr atoms, which is distinct from both types I and II multiferroicity. These findings are supported by a combination of second-harmonic generation, piezo-response force microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, magnetic, and Hall measurements. Our research provides not only an exemplary platform for delving into intrinsic magnetoelectric interactions at the single-layer limit but also sheds light on potential development of electronic and spintronic devices utilizing two-dimensional multiferroics.</description>

      <title>CTGNN: Crystal Transformer Graph Neural Network for Crystal Material Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of deep learning algorithm and materials science has made significant progress in predicting novel materials and understanding various behaviours of materials. Here, we introduced a new model called as the Crystal Transformer Graph Neural Network (CTGNN), which combines the advantages of Transformer model and graph neural networks to address the complexity of structure-properties relation of material data. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, CTGNN incorporates the graph network structure for capturing local atomic interactions and the dual-Transformer structures to model intra-crystal and inter-atomic relationships comprehensively. The benchmark carried on by the proposed CTGNN indicates that CTGNN significantly outperforms existing models like CGCNN and MEGNET in the prediction of formation energy and bandgap properties. Our work highlights the potential of CTGNN to enhance the performance of properties prediction and accelerates the discovery of new materials, particularly for perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into the Thermoelectric Characteristics of Silver-based Chalcopyrites Utilizing a Non-empirical Range-separated Dielectric-dependent Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our investigation explores the intricate domain of thermoelectric phenomena within silver (Ag)-infused chalcopyrites, focusing on compositions such as AgXTe$_2$ (where X=Ga, In) and the complex quaternary system Ag$_2$ZnSn/GeY$_2$ (with Y=S, Se). Using a sophisticated combination of methodologies, we integrate a non-empirical screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH) functional with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. This approach allows us to conduct a detailed analysis of critical thermoelectric properties, including electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factor. Our methodology goes beyond superficial assessments, delving into the intricate interplay of material properties to reveal their true thermoelectric potential. Additionally, we investigate the often-overlooked phenomena of phonon scattering by leveraging both the elastic constant tensor and the deformation potential method. This enables a rigorous examination of electron relaxation time and lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing the robustness of our predictions and demonstrating our commitment to thorough exploration.Through our rigorous investigation, we identify materials with a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT = $\sigma S^{2}T/ \kappa$) exceeding the critical threshold of unity. This significant achievement signals the discovery of materials capable of revolutionizing efficient thermoelectric systems. Our findings delineate a promising trajectory, laying the groundwork for the emergence of a new class of Ag-based chalcopyrites distinguished by their exceptional thermoelectric characteristics. This research not only contributes to the understanding of materials science principles but also catalyzes transformative advancements in thermoelectric technology.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic and analytical description on the quantitative phase-field model with enhanced interface diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the idea of maintaining physical diffuse interface kinetics, enhancing interfacial diffusivity has recently provided a new direction for quantitative phase-field simulation at microstructural length and time scale. Establishing a general relationship between interface diffusivity and width is vital to facilitate the practical application. However, it is still limited by time-consuming numerical corrections, and its relationship with non-dilute thermodynamic properties still needs to be revealed. In this study, we present a new thermodynamic and analytical method for determining interfacial diffusivity enhancement. Unlike previous numerical corrections of partition coefficients and interface temperature, this new method aims to keep several thermodynamic quantities unchanged after enlarging the interface width. These essential quantities are theoretically proven to be diffusion potential jump across the diffuse interface and free energy dissipation by trans-interface diffusion. Since no dilute approximation has been employed in model derivation, the present method is available for binary alloys with arbitrary thermodynamic properties and can be easily extended to describe multicomponent systems. Therefore, the present method is expected to advance the recent quantitative phase-field framework and facilitate its practical applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice matched heterogeneous nucleation eliminate defective buried interface in halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite-based semi-conducting hetero-structures have emerged as promising electronics for solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors, and photo-catalysts. Perovskites' efficiency, electronic properties and their long-term stability directly depend on their morphology [1-24]. Therefore, to manufacture stable and higher efficiency perovskite solar cells and electronics, it is now crucial to understand their micro-structure evolution. In this study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the formation of cesium lead bromide perovskite on interfaces. Our simulations reveal that perovskite crystallizes in a heteroepitaxial manner on widely employed oxide interfaces. This could introduce the formation of dislocations, voids and defects in the buried interface, and grain boundaries in the bulk crystal. From simulations, we find that lattice-matched interfaces could enable epitaxial ordered growth of perovskites and may prevent defect formation in the buried interface.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermal properties of a bulk Ni55Fe19Ga26 Heusler alloy in a conduction calorimeter. At slow heating and cooling rates (1K/h), we compare as-cast and annealed samples. We report a smaller thermal hysteresis after the thermal treatment due to the stabilization of the 14M modulated structure in the martensite phase. In ultraslow experiments (40mK/h), we detect and analyze the calorimetric avalanches associated with the direct and reverse martensitic transformation from cubic to 14M phase. This reveals a distribution of events characterized by a power law with exponential cutoff $p(u) \propto u^{-\varepsilon}\exp(-u/\xi)$ where $\varepsilon\sim 2$ and damping energies $\xi=370$uJ (direct) and $\xi=27$uJ (reverse) that characterize the asymmetry of the transformation.</description>

      <title>Microstructure and Stress Mapping in 3D at Industrially Relevant Degrees of Plastic Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strength, ductility, and failure properties of metals are tailored by plastic deformation routes. Predicting these properties requires modeling of the structural dynamics and stress evolution taking place on several length scales. Progress has been hampered by a lack of representative 3D experimental data at industrially relevant degrees of deformation. We present an X-ray imaging based 3D mapping of an aluminum polycrystal deformed to the ultimate tensile strength (32% elongation). The extensive dataset reveals significant intra-grain stress variations (36 MPa) up to at least half of the inter-grain variations (76 MPa), which are dominated by grain orientation effects. Local intra-grain stress concentrations are candidates for damage nucleation. Such data are important for models of structure-property relations and damage.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of asymmetric interfaces and electrostatic potentials inside a hafnia-zirconia ferroelectric nanocapacitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hafnia-based thin-film ferroelectric devices, chemical phenomena during growth and processing such as oxygen vacancy formation and interfacial reactions appear to strongly affect device performance. However, the nanoscale structure, chemistry, and electrical potentials in these devices are not fully known, making it difficult to understand their influence on device properties. Here, we directly image the composition and electrostatic potential with nanometer resolution in the cross section of a nanocrystalline W / Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2-\delta}$ (HZO) / W ferroelectric capacitor using multimodal electron microscopy. This reveals a 1.4 nm wide tungsten sub-oxide interfacial layer formed at the bottom interface during fabrication which introduces a potential dip and leads to asymmetric switching fields. Additionally, the measured inner potential in HZO is consistent with the presence of about 20% oxygen vacancies and a negative built-in potential in HZO. These chemical and electrostatic details are important to characterize and tune to achieve high performance ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal contribution to current-driven antiferromagnetic-order switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In information technology devices, current-driven state switching is crucial in various disciplines including spintronics, where the contribution of heating to the switching mechanism plays an inevitable role. Recently, current-driven antiferromagnetic order switching has attracted considerable attention due to its implications for next-generation spintronic devices. Although the switching mechanisms can be explained by spin dynamics induced by spin torques, some reports have claimed that demagnetization above the Neel temperature due to Joule heating is critical for switching. Here we present a systematic method and an analytical model to quantify the thermal contribution due to Joule heating in micro-electronic devices, focusing on current-driven octupole switching in the non-collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn. The results consistently show that the critical temperature for switching remains relatively constant above the Neel temperature, while the threshold current density depends on the choice of substrate and the base temperature. In addition, we provide an analytical model to calculate the Joule-heating temperature which quantitatively explains our experimental results. From numerical calculations, we illustrate the reconfiguration of magnetic orders during cooling from a demagnetized state of polycrystalline Mn3Sn. This work not only provides deeper insights into magnetization switching in antiferromagnets, but also a general guideline for evaluating the Joule-heating temperature excursions in micro-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous strain in quasi-two-dimensional Janus CdSe nanoplatelets and its microscopic mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous strain and spontaneous folding of thin nanoplatelets are known phenomena whose microscopic mechanisms are still debating. In this work, first-principles calculations are used to study the mechanical stresses that arise in Janus CdSe nanoplatelets and result in their spontaneous strain. Calculations reveal the existence of three microscopic mechanisms of this phenomenon. Two bulk mechanisms are associated with the inverse piezoelectric effect in an electric field created by the difference in electronegativities of ligands and by the depolarizing field resulting from the difference in the potential jumps in electrical double layers on the surfaces of nanoplatelets. These mechanisms account for 5-25% of the observed effect. The third mechanism is associated with the surface strain of nanoplatelets by bridging bonds, and its influence is predominant. It is shown that the latter mechanism cause spontaneous folding of thin CdSe nanoplatelets and, depending on the values of surface stresses and lateral orientation of nanoplatelets, can result in formation of their experimentally observed structures such as scrolls, spirals, and twisted ribbons.</description>

      <title>High-Mobility Carriers in Epitaxial IrO2 Films Grown using Hybrid Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary rutile oxides of 5d metals such as IrO2, stand out as a paradox due to limited experimental studies despite the rich predicted quantum phenomena. Here, we investigate the electrical transport properties of IrO2 by engineering epitaxial thin films grown via hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. Our findings reveal phonon-limited carrier transport and thickness-dependent anisotropic in-plane resistance in IrO2 (110) films, the latter suggesting a complex relationship between strain relaxation and orbital hybridization. Magneto-transport measurements reveal a previously unobserved non-linear Hall effect. A two-carrier analysis of this effect shows the presence of minority carriers with mobility exceeding 3000 cm2/Vs at 1.8 K. These results point towards emergent properties in 5d metal oxides that can be controlled using dimensionality and epitaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium carrier and phonon dynamics in the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast carrier and phonon dynamics in the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ using time-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Our results reveal that the electron-phonon thermalization process with a subpicosecond timescale is prolonged by the hot-phonon bottleneck effect. We identify the subsequent relaxation processes associated with two non-radiative recombination mechanisms, i.e., phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination and defect-related Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Temperature-dependent measurements indicate that all three relaxation components show large variation around 175 and 78 K, which is related to the initiation of spin fluctuation and ferrimagnetic order in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. In addition, two pronounced coherent optical phonons are observed, in which the phonon with a frequency of 3.7 THz is attributed to the $A_{1g}$ mode of Te precipitates. Applying the strain pulse propagation model to the coherent acoustic phonons yields a penetration depth of 506 nm and a sound speed of 2.42 km/s in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. Our results develop understanding of the nonequilibrium properties of the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and also shed light on its potential applications in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Formation of Iron-Helium Compounds under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While helium is a representative noble gas element characterized by its chemical inertness at ambient conditions, recent experiments and calculations argued that a minor amount of helium is incorporated into molten iron from silicate under high pressures. Here we examined the reaction between iron and helium at 8-42 GPa and ~1000-2820 K and found remarkable volume expansion of the Fe lattice, which is attributed to the formations of fcc and distorted hcp iron-helium compounds with x in FeHex up to 0.13 and 0.42, respectively. Upon releasing pressure under room temperature, these fcc and distorted hcp FeHex were still observed while the former lost some helium. In addition, our first-principles calculations indicate that fcc FeHe0.25, with He atoms in the tetrahedral interstitial sites, is dynamically stable in different magnetic states throughout 0-50 GPa. These results support that the Earth's core can be a large reservoir of primordial 3He.</description>

      <title>Fe2+ partitioning in Al-free pyrolite: consequences for seismic velocities and heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron partitioning among the main lower mantle phases, bridgmanite (Bm) and ferropericlase (Fp), has non-monotonic behavior owing to the high-spin to low-spin crossover in ferrous iron (Fe2+) in Fp. Results of previous studies of the iron partitioning coefficient between these phases, $K_D$, still have considerable uncertainty. Here, we investigate the Fe2+ partitioning behavior using well-documented ab initio free energy results plus new updates. Although we focus on Fe2+ only, we describe the effect of this iron spin crossover (ISC) on $K_D$ and of the latter on compositions and seismic velocities in a pyrolitic aggregate. Our results suggest that its velocities are mainly affected by the ISC and less so by the Fe2+ partitioning. In contrast, iron partitioning manifests in thermally induced velocity heterogeneity ratios. Prediction of the seismological parameter $R_{S/P}$ ($\partial \ln V_S/\partial \ln V_P$) including iron partitioning effects resembles quantitatively $R_{S/P}$'s inferred from several tomographic studies down to 2,400 km depth.</description>

      <title>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids using Density Functional theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix whose eigenstates also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that for the basis of each step of the iteration we use the previous eigenstate basis in the interstitial region but augmented inside the MT sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of that eigenstate. To reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, for practical applications on the order of 10 to 100 windows. This method combines the energy dependence of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment of basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of two spinodal decomposition criteria with a case study of Fe${}_{15}$Co${}_{15}$Ni${}_{35}$Cu${}_{35}$ multicomponent alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys has attracted increasing attention due to its beneficial effect on their mechanical and functional properties and potential applications. Both based on the Cahn-Hillard equation, the reference element method (REM) and the projection matrix method (PMM) are the two main methods to predict the occurrence of spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys. In this work, it is mathematically proven that the two methods are equivalent, and therefore the advanced results based on one method can be applied to the other. Based on these methods, the $Fe{}_{15}$Co${}_{15}$Ni${}_{35}$Cu${}_{35}$ multicomponent alloy is designed as a case study. Experimental results confirm the spinodal decomposition in the heat-treated alloy, and its strength and ductility are simultaneously enhanced. This work can be the pavement for further theoretical and experimental studies on the spinodal decomposition in multicomponent alloys.</description>

      <title>Self-induced spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect in single FePt thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.</description>

      <title>Alkaline earth metal mediated inter-molecular magnetism in perfluorocubane dimers and chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfluorocubane ($C_8F_8$) was successfully synthesized and found to accept and store electrons in its internal cubic cavity to form magnetic moments. However their inter-molecule spin-exchange coupling mechanism is yet to be revealed. In this study, we found the inter-molecule magnetic groundstates of $C_8F_8$ dimer and one-dimensional (1D) chain are tunable from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) by stacking orders and alkaline earth metals intercalation using first-principle calculations. The inter-molecule couplings are dominated by noncovalent halogen $C-F...C_4$ interactions. Stacking orders of dimers can regulate the relative position of the lone pairs and $\sigma-holes$ at the molecular interface and thus the magnetic groundstates. Alkaline earth metals M (M = Na, Mg) intercalations could form $C_4-M-C_4$ bonds and lead to FM direct exchange at the inter-molecule region. An unpaired electron donated by the intercalated atoms or electron doping can result in a local magnetic moment in dimers, exhibiting an on-off switching by the odd-even number of electron filling. Novel electronic properties such as spin gapless semiconductor and charge density wave (CDW) states emerge when $C_8F_8$ molecules self-assemble with intercalated atoms to form 1D chains. These findings manifest the roles of stacking and intercalation in modifying intermolecular magnetism and the revealed halogen bond-dominated exchange mechanisms are paramount additions to those previously established non-covalent couplings.</description>

      <title>Real topological phonons in 3D carbon allotropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a significant focus on real topological systems that enjoy space-time inversion symmetry (PT ) and lack spin-orbit coupling. While the theoretical classification of the real topology has been established, more progress has yet to be made in the materials realization of such real topological systems in three dimensions (3D). To address this crucial issue, by selecting the carbon-based material candidates as targets, we perform high-throughput computing to inspect the real topology in the phonon spectrums of the 3D carbon allotropes in the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA). Among 1192 kinds of 3D carbon allotropes, we find 65 real topological systems with a phononic real Chern insulating (PRCI) state, 2 real topological systems with a phononic real nodal line (PRNL) state, 10 real topological systems with a phononic real Dirac point (PRDP) state, and 8 real topological systems with a phononic real triple-point pair (PRTPP) state. This extremely expands the material candidates with real topology, especially for the gapless topological phonons. We exhibit the PRCI, PRNL, PRTPP, and PRDP states of 27-SG. 166-pcu-h, 1081-SG. 194- 4 2T13-CA, 52-SG. 141-gis, and 132-SG. 191-3,4T157 as illustrative examples, and explore the second-order boundary mode, i.e., phononic hinge mode. Among the four examples, the materials 1081-SG. 194-42T13-CA and 52-SG. 141-gis are so ideal that the PRNL and PRTPP in them are well separated from other bands, and the phononic hinge mode can be clearly observed. This study aims to broaden the understanding of 3D topological phonons, and emphasizes the potential of 3D carbon allotropes as a valuable framework for exploring the fascinating physics related to phononic hinge modes and phononic real topology.</description>

Abstract: Efficient and precise calculations of thermal transport properties and figure of merit, alongside a deep comprehension of thermal transport mechanisms, are essential for the practical utilization of advanced thermoelectric materials. In this study, we explore the microscopic processes governing thermal transport in the distinguished crystalline material Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$ by integrating a unified thermal transport theory with machine learning-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations. Leveraging machine learning potentials, we expedite the analysis of phonon energy shifts, higher-order scattering mechanisms, and thermal conductivity arising from various contributing factors like population and coherence channels. Our finding unveils an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.31 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, a result that closely correlates with experimental observations. Notably, we observe that the off-diagonal terms of heat flux operators play a significant role in shaping the overall lattice thermal conductivity of Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$, where the ultralow thermal conductivity resembles that of glass due to limited group velocities. Furthermore, we achieve a maximum $ZT$ value of 3.17 in the $c$-axis orientation for \textit{p}-type Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$ at 600 K, and an optimal $ZT$ value of 2.26 in the $a$-axis and $b$-axis direction for \textit{n}-type Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$ at 500 K. The crystalline Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$ not only showcases remarkable thermal insulation but also demonstrates impressive electrical properties owing to the dual-degeneracy phenomenon within its valence band. These results not only elucidate the underlying reasons for the exceptional thermoelectric performance of Tl$_9$SbTe$_6$ but also suggest potential avenues for further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Simulating X-ray absorption spectroscopy of battery materials on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a crucial experimental technique for elucidating the mechanisms of structural degradation in battery materials. However, extracting information from the measured spectrum is challenging without high-quality simulations. In this work, we propose simulating near-edge X-ray absorption spectra as a promising application for quantum computing. It is attractive due to the ultralocal nature of X-ray absorption that significantly reduces the sizes of problems to be simulated, and because of the classical hardness of simulating spectra. We describe three quantum algorithms to compute the X-ray absorption spectrum and provide their asymptotic cost. One of these is a Monte-Carlo based time-domain algorithm, which is cost-friendly to early fault-tolerant quantum computers. We then apply the framework to an industrially relevant example, a CAS(22e,18o) active space for an O-Mn cluster in a Li-excess battery cathode, showing that practically useful simulations could be obtained with much fewer qubits and gates than ground-state energy estimation of the same material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical polishing of diamond is known to be detrimental to the spin lifetime and strain environment of near-surface defects. By utilising a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, we demonstrate that we can achieve 13C-limited spin lifetimes of shallow implanted (&lt;34 nm) NV centres in an industrially scalable process. We compare spin lifetimes (T2) of three diamonds processed with CMP with one processed by inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE), and observe an increased median T2 of 355 microseconds in the CMP-processed samples for 15NV centres implanted and annealed under identical conditions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing moir\'e ferroelectricity to modulate semiconductor monolayer light emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity has been recently discovered in stacked or twisted van der Waals (vdW) moir\'e systems. The versatility of producing a large array of size-tunable domains and integration with diverse functional materials make them an enticing platform for developing multifunctional devices. Here, we show that ferroelectric polar domains formed in a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN) substrate can modulate light emission from an adjacent semiconductor monolayer. The abrupt change in electrostatic potential across the domains produces an in-plane electric field (E-field) and leads to a remarkably large exciton Stark shift in the adjacent MoSe$_2$ monolayer, previously only observable in \textit{p-n} junctions created by the advanced e-beam lithography tools. Both the spectrum and spatial pattern of the light emission from the monolayer are periodically modulated by the remote moir\'e potential imposed by the t-hBN substrate. We further observe a characteristic hysteresis behavior in the light emission as an electric gate erases and restores the domains. Our findings chart an exciting pathway for integrating nanometer-scale moir\'e ferroelectric domains with various optically active functional layers, paving the way for advanced nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model is presented to predict hydrogen-assisted fatigue. The model combines a phase field description of fracture and fatigue, stress-assisted hydrogen diffusion, and a toughness degradation formulation with cyclic and hydrogen contributions. Hydrogen-assisted fatigue crack growth predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with experiments over all the scenarios considered, spanning multiple load ratios, H2 pressures and loading frequencies. These are obtained without any calibration with hydrogen-assisted fatigue data, taking as input only mechanical and hydrogen transport material properties, the material's fatigue characteristics (from a single test in air), and the sensitivity of fracture toughness to hydrogen content. Furthermore, the model is used to determine: (i) what are suitable test loading frequencies to obtain conservative data, and (ii) the underestimation made when not pre-charging samples. The model can handle both laboratory specimens and large-scale engineering components, enabling the Virtual Testing paradigm in infrastructure exposed to hydrogen environments and cyclic loading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big data has ushered in a new wave of predictive power using machine learning models. In this work, we assess what {\it big} means in the context of typical materials-science machine-learning problems. This concerns not only data volume, but also data quality and veracity as much as infrastructure issues. With selected examples, we ask (i) how models generalize to similar datasets, (ii) how high-quality datasets can be gathered from heterogenous sources, (iii) how the feature set and complexity of a model can affect expressivity, and (iv) what infrastructure requirements are needed to create larger datasets and train models on them. In sum, we find that big data present unique challenges along very different aspects that should serve to motivate further work.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone.</description>

Abstract: We present a numerical simulation of the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the $L_{2,3}$ edge of Mn in altermagnetic MnF$_2$ using a combination of density functional + exact diagonlization of an atomic model. We explore how the dichroic spectra vary with the light propagation vector and the N\'eel vector. We show how XMCD in rutile structures can be employed to determine the orientation of the N\'eel vector. An exact relationship between the XMCD spectra for different orientation of the N\'eel vector valid in the absence on the valence spin-orbit coupling and core-valence multipole interaction is derived and its approximate validity demonstrated by numerical calculation for the full Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Tunable moir\'e bandgap in hBN-aligned bilayer graphene device with in-situ electrostatic gating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, great efforts have been devoted in introducing a sizable and tunable band gap in graphene for its potential application in next-generation electronic devices. The primary challenge in modulating this gap has been the absence of a direct method for observing changes of the band gap in momentum space. In this study, we employ advanced spatial- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy technique to directly visualize the gap formation in bilayer graphene, modulated by both displacement fields and moir\'e potentials. The application of displacement field via in-situ electrostatic gating introduces a sizable and tunable electronic bandgap, proportional to the field strength up to 100 meV. Meanwhile, the moir\'e potential, induced by aligning the underlying hexagonal boron nitride substrate, extends the bandgap by ~ 20 meV. Theoretical calculations, effectively capture the experimental observations. Our investigation provides a quantitative understanding of how these two mechanisms collaboratively modulate the band gap in bilayer graphene, offering valuable guidance for the design of graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncompensated non-equilibrium orbital magnetization may arise at sample edges in the presence of charge current. The value of the effect scales as the product of the current density and the electron mean free path without any additional smallness. This non-relativistic phenomenon originates in a lack of inversion symmetry of the electron wave functions in a vicinity of sample interfaces. In a conducting layer, where $z$ direction is chosen perpendicular to the surface, and the current flows in $x$ direction, the non-equilibrium orbital magnetization points in $y$ direction. In a top-bottom symmetric layer, the orbital magnetization has an opposite sign near the top and bottom interfaces thus mimicking the symmetry of the spin-Hall effect but can exceed the latter by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In pursuit of quantum advancements across disciplines, a bright and coherent electron source is expected to be a cornerstone of diverse applications including electron microscopy, laser accelerators, and free electron lasers. Current cathodes, such as cold field and photoemission, can generate high-quality electron beams with different cathode materials, geometric configurations, and laser excitation profiles, but their maintenance of both quantum coherence and high beam brightness suffers from the space-charge repulsion of many electrons. Here, we propose a new mechanism to provide collective emission of coherent electrons based on Auger photoemission. Our approach leverages a photon-induced four-level Auger process that necessitates a combination of photoemission and Auger recombination. The Auger electrons, energized through a recycling process of photoelectrons, emit collectively into the vacuum as secondary electrons. We compare coherent and incoherent Auger photoemission, identifying that the working condition of the coherent photoemission requires population inversion, akin to the four-level laser system. Our work provides insights for experimental realization and nanofabrication of Auger photocathodes, addressing a critical need in advancing quantum technologies relating to correlated coherent sources.</description>

Abstract: We show that driving polar optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where polarization or magnetization oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and is accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation for certain symmetries. We predict its signatures in time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results open the way to realizing tunable density waves in solids on the nanoscale using THz or IR light.</description>

Abstract: We report three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterointerface from a single-view data set using multislice ptychography. We identify the buried heterointerface between two twisted h-BN flakes with a lateral resolution of 0.57 {\AA} and a depth resolution of 2.5 nm. The latter is a significant improvement (~2.7 times) over the aperture-limited depth resolution of incoherent imaging modes such as annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. This is attributed to the diffraction signal extending beyond the aperture edge with the depth resolution set by the curvature of the Ewald sphere. Future advances to this approach could improve the depth resolution to the sub-nanometer level and enable the identification of individual dopants, defects and color centers in twisted heterointerfaces and other materials.</description>

      <title>Iterative Phase Retrieval Algorithms for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has been extensively used for imaging complex materials down to atomic resolution. The most commonly employed STEM modality, annular dark-field imaging, produces easily-interpretable contrast, but is dose-inefficient and produces little to no discernible contrast for light elements and weakly-scattering samples. An alternative is to use STEM phase retrieval imaging, enabled by high speed detectors able to record full images of a diffracted STEM probe over a grid of scan positions. Phase retrieval imaging in STEM is highly dose-efficient, enabling the measurement of the structure of beam-sensitive materials such as biological samples. Here, we comprehensively describe the theoretical background, algorithmic implementation details, and perform both simulated and experimental tests for three iterative phase retrieval STEM methods: focused-probe differential phase contrast, defocused-probe parallax imaging, and a generalized ptychographic gradient descent method implemented in two and three dimensions. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches by comparing the transfer of information using analytical expressions and numerical results for a white-noise model. This presentation of STEM phase retrieval methods aims to make these methods more approachable, reproducible, and more readily adoptable for many classes of samples.</description>

Abstract: We study the electronic excitation spectra in solid molecular hydrogen (phase I) at ambient temperature and 5-90 GPa pressures using Quantum Monte Carlo methods and Many-Body Perturbation Theory. In this range, the system changes from a wide gap molecular insulator to a semiconductor, altering the nature of the excitations from localized to delocalized. Computed gaps and spectra agree with experiments, proving the ability to predict accurately band gaps of many-body systems in presence of nuclear quantum and thermal effects.</description>

Abstract: An important yet challenging aspect of atomistic materials modeling is reconciling experimental and computational results. Conventional approaches involve generating numerous configurations through molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo structure optimization and selecting the one with the closest match to experiment. However, this inefficient process is not guaranteed to succeed. We introduce a general method to combine atomistic machine learning (ML) with experimental observables that produces atomistic structures compatible with experiment by design. We use this approach in combination with grand-canonical Monte Carlo within a modified Hamiltonian formalism, to generate configurations that agree with experimental data and are chemically sound (low in energy). We apply our approach to understand the atomistic structure of oxygenated amorphous carbon (a-CO$_{x}$), an intriguing carbon-based material, to answer the question of how much oxygen can be added to carbon before it fully decomposes into CO and CO$_2$. Utilizing an ML-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) model trained from $GW$ and density functional theory (DFT) data, in conjunction with an ML interatomic potential, we identify a-CO$_{x}$ structures compliant with experimental XPS predictions that are also energetically favorable with respect to DFT. Employing a network analysis, we accurately deconvolve the XPS spectrum into motif contributions, both revealing the inaccuracies inherent to experimental XPS interpretation and granting us atomistic insight into the structure of a-CO$_{x}$. This method generalizes to multiple experimental observables and allows for the elucidation of the atomistic structure of materials directly from experimental data, thereby enabling experiment-driven materials modeling with a degree of realism previously out of reach.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Model for Catalytic Methane Pyrolysis</title>

Abstract: Methane pyrolysis provides a scalable alternative to conventional hydrogen production methods, avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. However, high operating temperatures limit economic feasibility on an industrial scale. A major scientific goal is, therefore, to find a catalyst material that lowers operating temperatures, making methane pyrolysis economically viable. In this work, we derive a model that provides a qualitative comparison of possible catalyst materials. The model is based on calculations of adsorption energies using density functional theory. Thirty different elements were considered. Adsorption energies of intermediate molecules in the methane pyrolysis reaction correlate linearly with the adsorption energy of carbon. Moreover, the adsorption energy increases in magnitude with decreasing group number in the $d$-block of the periodic table. For a temperature range between 600 and 1200 K and a normalized partial pressure range for $\mathrm{H_2}$ between $10^{-1}$ and $10^{-5}$, a total of eighteen different materials were found to be optimal catalysts at least once. This indicates that catalyst selection and reactor operating conditions should be well-matched. The present work establishes the foundation for future large-scale studies of surfaces, alloy compositions, and material classes using machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Interplay between alloying and tramp element effects on temper embrittlement in bcc iron: DFT and thermodynamic insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The details of the temper embrittlement mechanism in steels caused by impurities are unknown. Especially from an atomistic point of view, there are still open questions regarding their interactions with alloying elements such as Ni, Cr, and Mo. Therefore, we used density functional theory to investigate the segregation and co-segregation behavior and the resulting influence on the cohesion of three representative tilt grain boundaries in iron. The results are implemented in a multi-site and multi-component kinetic and thermodynamic model for grain boundary segregation, to gain insights into the temporal and final grain boundary coverage. Our results show that the segregation tendency of As, Sb, and Sn is stronger than that of the alloying elements and significantly mitigates the grain boundary cohesion. Depending on the GB type, interactions between Sb and Sn vary from negligible to strongly attractive, which increases the likelihood of co-segregation. The cohesion-weakening effect is further amplified when elements such as Sb, Sn, and As co-segregate, compared to their individual segregation. In contrast, the co-segregation of Ni and Cr does not significantly increase the enrichment of impurities at grain boundaries, and their impact on cohesion is found to be negligible. The ability of Mo to mitigate reversible temper embrittlement is primarily attributed to its cohesion-enhancing effect and its capability to repel tramp elements from GBs, rather than scavenging them within the bulk, as suggested by previous literature.</description>

      <title>Circular Photocurrents in Centrosymmetric Semiconductors with Hidden Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric materials with site inversion asymmetries possess hidden spin polarization, which remains challenging to be converted into spin currents because the global inversion symmetry is still conserved. This study demonstrates the spin-polarized DC circular photocurrents (CPC) in centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) at normal incidence without applying electric bias. The global inversion symmetry is broken by using a spatially-varying circularly polarized light beam, which could generate spin gradient owing to the hidden spin polarization. The dependences of the CPC on electrode configuration, illumination position, and beam spot size indicate an emergence of circulating electric current under spatially inhomogeneous light, which is associated with the deflection of spin-polarized current through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The CPC is subsequently utilized to probe the spin polarization and ISHE under different excitation wavelengths and temperatures. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using centrosymmetric materials with hidden spin polarization and non-vanishing Berry curvature for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Towards the Quantized Anomalous Hall effect in AlO$_x$-capped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ harbors a rich interplay between magnetism and topology, holding a significant promise for low-power electronic devices and topological antiferromagnetic spintronics. In recent years, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has garnered considerable attention as the only known material to exhibit the antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, this field faces significant challenges as realizing quantized transport at zero magnetic fields depends critically on fabricating high-quality device. In this article, we address the detrimental influences of fabrication on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ by simply depositing an AlO$_x$ thin layer on the surface prior to fabrications. Optical contrast and magnetotransport measurements on over 50 samples demonstrate that AlO$_x$ can effectively preserve the pristine state of the samples and significantly enhance the anomalous Hall effect towards quantization. Scaling analysis reveals the Berry curvature dominated mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect at various magnetic configurations. By adjusting the gate voltage, we uncover a gate independent antiferromagnetism in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our experiment not only pave the way for fabricating high-quality transport devices but also advance the exploration of exotic quantum physics in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a powerful tool for probing the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of materials. Historically, $\textit{in situ}$ magnetic fields have been carefully avoided as they are detrimental to the control of photoelectron trajectory during the photoelectron detection process. However, magnetic field is an important experimental knob for both probing and tuning symmetry-breaking phases and electronic topology in quantum materials. In this paper, we introduce an easily implementable method for realizing an $\textit{in situ}$ tunable magnetic field at the sample position in an ARPES experiment and analyze magnetic field induced artifacts in ARPES data. Specifically, we identified and quantified three distinct extrinsic effects of a magnetic field: Fermi surface rotation, momentum shrinking, and momentum broadening. We examined these effects in three prototypical quantum materials, i.e., a topological insulator (Bi$_2$Se$_3$), an iron-based superconductor (LiFeAs), and a cuprate superconductor (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$), and demonstrate the feasibility of ARPES measurements in the presence of a controllable magnetic field. Our studies lay the foundation for the future development of the technique and interpretation of ARPES measurements of field-tunable quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Modeling the performance and bandwidth of single-atom adiabatic quantum memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum repeaters that will form the backbone of the future quantum internet. Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have applied a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network.</description>

      <title>Spin Space Groups: Full Classification and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we exhaust all the spin-space symmetries, which fully characterize collinear, non-collinear, commensurate, and incommensurate spiral magnetism, and investigate enriched features of electronic bands that respect these symmetries. We achieve this by systematically classifying the so-called spin space groups (SSGs) - joint symmetry groups of spatial and spin operations that leave the magnetic structure unchanged. Generally speaking, they are accurate (approximate) symmetries in systems where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is negligible (finite but weaker than the interested energy scale); but we also show that specific SSGs could remain valid even in the presence of a strong SOC. By representing the SSGs as O($N$) representations, we - for the first time - obtain the complete classifications of 1421, 9542, and 56512 distinct SSGs for collinear ($N=1$), coplanar ($N=2$), and non-coplanar ($N=3$) magnetism, respectively. SSG not only fully characterizes the symmetry of spin d.o.f., but also gives rise to exotic electronic states, which, in general, form projective representations of magnetic space groups (MSGs). Surprisingly, electronic bands in SSGs exhibit features never seen in MSGs, such as nonsymmorphic SSG Brillouin zone (BZ), where SSG operations behave as glide or screw when act on momentum and unconventional spin-momentum locking, which is completely determined by SSG, independent of Hamiltonian details. To apply our theory, we identify the SSG for each of the 1604 published magnetic structures in the MAGNDATA database on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server. Material examples exhibiting aforementioned novel features are discussed with emphasis. We also investigate new types of SSG-protected topological electronic states that are unprecedented in MSGs.</description>

      <title>Microstructural investigation of hybrid CAD/CAM restorative dental materials by micro-CT and SEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objectives: An increasing number of CAD/CAM (computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing) hybrid materials have been introduced to the dental market in recent years. In addition, CAD/CAM hybrid materials for additive manufacturing (AM) are becoming more attractive in digital dentistry. Studies on material microstructures using micro-computed tomography ($\mu$-CT) combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have only been available to a limited extent so far.
  Methods: One CAD/CAM three-dimensional- (3D-) printable hybrid material (VarseoSmile Crown plus) and two CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials (Vita Enamic; Voco Grandio), as well as one direct composite material (Ceram.x duo), were included in the present study. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 2 mm were produced from each material and investigated by means of synchrotron radiation $\mu$-CT at a voxel size of 0.65 $\mu$m. Different samples from the same materials, obtained by cutting and polishing, were investigated by SEM.
  Results: The 3D-printed hybrid material showed some agglomerations and a more irregular distribution of fillers, as well as a visible layered macrostructure and a few spherical pores due to the printing process. The CAD/CAM millable hybrid materials revealed a more homogenous distribution of ceramic particles. The direct composite material showed multiple air bubbles and microstructural irregularities based on manual processing.
  Significance: The $\mu$-CT and SEM analysis of the materials revealed different microstructures even though they belong to the same class of materials. It could be shown that $\mu$-CT and SEM imaging are valuable tools to understand microstructure and related mechanical properties of materials.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional coherent spectrum of high-spin models via a quantum computing approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key issue in the use of high-power mid-infrared (Mid-IR) laser sources for a plethora of applications is the investigation of the exciting laser driven physical phenomena taking place in materials coated with dielectric films. Here, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast processes and thermal response upon excitation of two-layered complexes consisting of fused silica thin films placed on silicon substrates with ultrashort pulsed lasers in the Mid-IR spectral regime. Through the development of a theoretical model, we demonstrate that the control of the underlying ultrafast phenomena and the damage threshold (DT) of the substrate are achieved via an appropriate modulation of the thickness of the SiO2 film. It is shown that a decrease of DT by up to 27% compared to the absence of coating is feasible emphasising the impact of coatings of a lower refractive index than the substrate. Besides this, it is demonstrated that no absorption of energy occurs within the SiO2 layer, therefore the dynamics of the reflectivity of the two-layered complex is directly associated with the electron excitation in the substrate. These remarkable predictions can be employed for the development of new optical coatings and components for nonlinear optics and photonics for a large range of Mid-IR laser-based applications.</description>

Abstract: This review presents recent breakthroughs in the realm of nonlinear Hall effects, emphasizing central theoretical foundations and recent experimental progress. We elucidate the quantum origin of the second-order Hall response, focusing on the Berry curvature dipole, which may arise in inversion symmetry broken systems. The theoretical framework also reveals the impact of disorder scattering effects on the nonlinear response. We further discuss the possibility of obtaining nonlinear Hall responses beyond the second order. We examine symmetry-based indicators essential for the manifestation of nonlinear Hall effects in time-reversal symmetric crystals, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of theoretical models and candidate materials predicted to exhibit sizable and tunable Berry curvature dipole. We summarize groundbreaking experimental reports on measuring both intrinsic and extrinsic nonlinear Hall effects across diverse material classes. Finally, we highlight some of the other intriguing nonlinear effects, including nonlinear planar Hall, nonlinear anomalous Hall, and nonlinear spin and valley Hall effects. We conclude with an outlook on pivotal open questions and challenges, marking the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17809v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of surfaces and interfaces plays a key role in the properties of quantum devices. Here, we study the electronic structure of realistic Al/InAs/Al heterojunctions using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and state-of-the-art quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) calculations. We find a good agreement between QS$GW$ calculations and hybrid functional calculations which themselves compare favourably well with ARPES experiments. Our study confirm the need of well controlled quality of the interfaces to obtain the needed properties of InAs/Al heterojunctions. A detailed analysis of the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the spin-splitting of the electronic states show a linear scaling in $k$-space, related to the two-dimensional nature of some interface states. The good agreement by QS$GW$ and hybrid functional calculations open the door towards trust-able use of an effective approximation to QS$GW$ for studying very large heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Negative longitudinal resistance of monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the quantum Hall regime the charge current is carried by ideal one-dimensional edge channels where the backscattering is prohibited by topology. This results in the constant potential along the edge of the Hall bar leading to zero 4-terminal longitudinal resistance r_xx. Finite scattering between the counter-propagating edge states, when the topological protection is broken, commonly results in r_xx &gt; 0. However, a local disorder, if allowing intersection of the edge states, can result in a counter-intuitive scenario when r_xx&lt;0. In this work we report the observation and a systematic study of such unconventional negative longitudinal resistance seen in an encapsulated monolayer graphene Hall bar device measured in the quantum Hall regime. We supplement our findings with the numerical calculations which allow us to outline the conditions necessary for the appearance of negative r_xx and to exclude the macroscopic disorder (contamination bubble) as the main origin of it.</description>
