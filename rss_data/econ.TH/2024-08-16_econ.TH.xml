      <title>Games under the Tiered Deferred Acceptance Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-stage admission mechanism, known as the tiered deferred acceptance mechanism, designed to benefit some schools over others. The current Chinese college and Turkish high school admission mechanisms are two examples. In this mechanism, schools are partitioned into tiers, and the deferred acceptance algorithm is applied within each tier. Once assigned, students cannot apply to schools in subsequent tiers. This mechanism is not strategy-proof. Therefore, we study the Nash equilibria of the induced preference revelation game. We show that Nash equilibrium outcomes are nested in the sense that merging tiers preserves all equilibrium outcomes. We also identify within-tier acyclicity as a necessary and sufficient condition for the mechanism to implement stable matchings in equilibrium. Our findings suggest that transitioning from the deferred acceptance mechanism to the tiered deferred acceptance mechanism may not improve student quality at top-tier schools as intended.</description>

      <title>The Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is an optimization problem that involves determining optimal routes and schedules for several vehicles to pick up and deliver items at minimum cost. Motivated by real-world carpooling and crowdshipping scenarios, we introduce an additional constraint imposing a maximum number on the number of pickups per trip. This results in the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Limited Pickups per Trip (DARP-LPT). We apply a fragment-based method for DARP-LPT, where a fragment is a partial path. Specifically, we extend two formulations from Rist &amp; Forbes (2021): the Fragment Flow Formulation (FFF) and the Fragment Assignment Formulation (FAF). We establish FFF's superiority over FAF, both from a theoretical as well as from a computational perspective. Furthermore, our results show that FFF and FAF significantly outperform traditional arc-based formulations in terms of solution quality and time. Additionally, compared to the two existing fragment sets, one with longer partial paths and another with shorter ones, our newly generated fragment sets perform better in terms of solution quality and time when fed into FFF.</description>

      <title>When Simple is Near Optimal in Security Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fraud is ubiquitous across applications and involve users bypassing the rule of law, often with the strategic aim of obtaining some benefit that would otherwise be unattainable within the bounds of lawful conduct. However, user fraud can be detrimental.
  To mitigate the harms of user fraud, we study the problem of policing fraud as a security game between an administrator and users. In this game, an administrator deploys $R$ security resources (e.g., police officers) across $L$ locations and levies fines against users engaging in fraud at those locations. For this security game, we study both payoff and revenue maximization administrator objectives. In both settings, we show that computing the optimal administrator strategy is NP-hard and develop natural greedy algorithm variants for the respective settings that achieve at least half the payoff or revenue as the payoff-maximizing or revenue-maximizing solutions, respectively. We also establish a resource augmentation guarantee that our proposed greedy algorithms with one extra resource, i.e., $R+1$ resources, achieve at least the same payoff (revenue) as the payoff-maximizing (revenue-maximizing) outcome with $R$ resources. Moreover, in the setting when user types are homogeneous, we develop a near-linear time algorithm for the revenue maximization problem and a polynomial time approximation scheme for the payoff maximization problem.
  Next, we present numerical experiments based on a case study of parking enforcement at Stanford University's campus, highlighting the efficacy of our algorithms in increasing parking permit earnings at the university by over \$300,000 annually. Finally, we study several model extensions, including incorporating contracts to bridge the gap between the payoff and revenue-maximizing outcomes and generalizing our model to incorporate additional constraints beyond a resource budget constraint.</description>
