      <title>Quantum Vortices in Curved Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control over the geometry and topology of quantum systems is crucial for advancing novel quantum technologies. This work provides a synthesis of recent insights into the behaviour of quantum vortices within atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subject to curved geometric constraints. We highlight the significant impact of the curvature on the condensate density and phase distribution, particularly in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides for different angular momentum states. An engineered periodic transport of the quantized vorticity between density-coupled ring-shaped condensates is discussed. The significant role of curved geometry in shaping the dynamics of rotational Josephson vortices in long atomic Josephson junctions is illustrated for the system of vertically stacked toroidal condensates. Different methods for the controlled creation of rotational Josephson vortices in coupled ring systems are described in the context of the formation of long-lived vortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs with cylindrical geometry. Future directions of explorations of vortices in curved geometries with implications for quantum information processing and sensing technologies are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multipole quantum droplets in quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum droplets emerging in a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric mixture of two atomic species with different intra-component coupling constants. We find that such mixtures support a rich variety of multipole quantum droplets, where the macroscopic wavefunction of one component changes its sign and features distinctive multipole structure, while the wavefunction of another component does not have zeros. Such multipole droplets have no counterparts in the reduced single-component model frequently used to describe symmetric one-dimensional mixtures. We study transformations of multipole states upon variation of the chemical potential of each component and demonstrate that quantum droplets can split into separated fundamental states, transform into flat-top multipoles, or into multipole component coupled to flat-top state with several humps on it, akin to anti-dark solitons. Multipole quantum droplets described here are stable in large part of their existence domain. Our findings essentially broaden the family of quantum droplet states emerging in the beyond-meanfield regime and open the way for observation of such heterostructured states in Bose-Bose mixtures.</description>

      <title>Solution landscape of reaction-diffusion systems reveals a nonlinear mechanism and spatial robustness of pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous pattern formation in homogeneous systems is ubiquitous in nature. Although Turing demonstrated that spatial patterns can emerge in reaction-diffusion (RD) systems when the homogeneous state becomes linearly unstable, it remains unclear whether the Turing mechanism is the only route for pattern formation. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm to systematically map the solution landscape to find all steady-state solutions. By applying our method to generic RD models, we find that stable spatial patterns can emerge via saddle-node bifurcations before the onset of Turing instability. Furthermore, by using a generalized action in functional space based on large deviation theory, our method is extended to evaluate stability of spatial patterns against noise. Applying this general approach in a three-species RD model, we show that though formation of Turing patterns only requires two chemical species, the third species is critical for stabilizing patterns against strong intrinsic noise in small biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>
