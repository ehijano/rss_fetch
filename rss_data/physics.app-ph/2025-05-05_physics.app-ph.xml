      <title>Wildfire Smoke -- A Rigorous Challenge for HVAC Air Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant air quality challenge as the smoke they produce can travel long distances and infiltrate indoor spaces. HVAC filters serve as a primary defense against this threat. In our study, we tested over 17 different types of commercially available filter media, including charged and uncharged synthetic, as well as fiberglass media, from leading global manufacturers, to assess their efficiency in removing smoke, using pine needle smoke as a proxy for wildfire smoke. Our findings revealed that charged polymer media, across all tested MERV grades, showed a rapid decline in smoke removal efficiency within minutes while causing no increase in airflow resistance. In contrast, mechanical media demonstrated more stable performance but experienced an increase in airflow resistance. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we examined smoke deposition on fiber media, revealing unique interactions that contribute to the decline in filtration performance. These results suggest the need to reconsider current standards - whose testing is centered around inorganic particle removal - and the applicability of their ratings to smoke filtration. Our study also highlights the critical need to develop standard testing methods and evaluation criteria specific to smoke particles in HVAC filters to better protect human occupants during wildfire events.</description>

      <title>Robust electro-mechanical actuation in hydrogenated Xenes leading to reversible topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report from first principles, the possibility of reversible onset of topological insulator(TI) phase in heavier hydrogenated Xenes (Xane), namely, germanane and stanane, exclusively through in-plane electro-mechanical actuation. It is found possible to systematically induce robust uniaxial strain through non-uniform application of electric field in the plane of monolayers, as possible through application of in-homogeneous bias at gates of realizable length-scales embedded underneath. Electrically induced strain causes substantial lowering of band-gap across all Xanes, eventually evolving through weak followed by strong topologically insulating phases beyond a threshold degree of bias in-homogeneity in heavier Xanes, promisingly within the range of bias sustained by the monolayers. In case of nano-ribbons of these Xanes, bias applied in-homogeneously across width promises switchable emergence of TI phase over a fraction of width and topologically protected interface states localizable anywhere across the half-width of the ribbon. The demonstrated electro-mechanical actuation and the associated topological tuning of band-structure, thematically verified in gapped graphene based representative systems within the Kane-Mele model at half-filling, should be possible in the broader class of two dimensional covalent networks made of elements of the p-block.</description>

      <title>A low-loss, 24-mode laser-written universal photonic processor in a glass-based platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.5 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Leakage Suppression Across Temperature in Al1-xScxN Thin Film Ferroelectric Capacitors through Boron Incorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents high-temperature ferroelectric characterization of 40~nm Al$_{1-x-y}$B$_x$Sc$_y$N (AlBScN) thin film capacitors grown by co-sputtering Al$_{0.89}$B$_{0.11}$ and Sc targets onto Pt(111)/Ti(002)/Si(100) substrates. Structural analysis confirmed a c-axis-oriented wurtzite structure with a low surface roughness of 1.37~nm. Ferroelectric switching, characterized by positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurements up to 600~$^\circ$C, exhibited a linear decrease in coercive fields from 6.2~MV/cm at room temperature to 4.2~MV/cm at 600~$^\circ$C, while remanent polarization remained stable with temperature. Direct current I-V measurements highlight a significant suppression of leakage currents, over two orders of magnitude lower compared to AlScN capacitors fabricated under similar conditions. These results position AlBScN thin films as strong candidates for ferroelectric applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Strain-Balanced Low-Temperature-Grown Beryllium-Doped InGaAs/InAlAs Superlattices for High-Performance Terahertz Photoconductors under 1550 nm Laser Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the photoconductive properties of low-temperature-grown Beryllium (Be)-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced superlattices (SLs) grown by molecular beam epitaxy under stationary growth conditions on semi-insulating InP:Fe substrates. The stationary growth approach enabled precise control over lateral gradients in layer strain, composition, and thickness across a single wafer, while strain-balancing facilitated pseudomorphic growth to explore a wide range of structural parameters, providing a robust platform to study their influence on photoconductive performance. Structural characterization confirmed high crystalline quality and smooth surface morphology in all samples. Time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy revealed subpicosecond carrier lifetimes, validating the effectiveness of strain balancing and Be doping in tuning ultrafast recombination dynamics. Hall effect measurements supported by 8-band k.p modeling revealed enhanced carrier mobility in strain-balanced SLs compared to lattice-matched structures, primarily due to reduced electron and hole effective masses and stronger quantum confinement. Additionally, optical absorption under 1550 nm excitation showed improved absorption coefficients for the strain-balanced structure, consistent with the reduction in bandgap energy predicted by theoretical modeling, thereby enhancing photon-to-carrier conversion efficiency. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy provided first-time evidence of significant Be-induced interdiffusion at the strained SL interfaces, an important factor influencing carrier transport and dynamics. These findings position low-temperature-grown Be-doped InGaAs/InAlAs strain-balanced SLs as promising materials for high-performance broadband THz photoconductive detectors operating at telecom-compatible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>A computational framework for predicting the effect of surface roughness in fatigue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Perfectly-Matched Metamaterials Via Circuit-Based Surrogate Models and the Adjoint Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, perfectly-matched metamaterials (PMMs) are described and combined with inverse design to realize broadband devices. PMMs are discretized metamaterials with anisotropic unit cells selected from a constrained design space, referred to as perfectly-matched media. PMMs exhibit the unique property that all their unit cells are impedance-matched to each other as well as to the host medium they are embedded within under all excitations. As a result, PMM devices rely on reflectionless refractive effects to achieve a prescribed function. This property enables true time delay performance and promises broadband capabilities. Two design examples are presented to demonstrate the potential of inverse-designed PMMs: a compact, broadband beam-collimator with a prescribed amplitude taper and a multi-input multi-output beamformer exhibiting zero scan loss.</description>

      <title>A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations-covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition-demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.</description>

      <title>Comparing the performance of direct and parametric drives for piezoelectric MEMS actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates and compares the response of piezoelectrically actuated nonlinear microelectromechanical devices (MEMS) to direct and to degenerate parametric drives. We describe the regime of degenerate parametric amplification in piezoelectric Duffing-type nonlinear MEMS devices using a single mode expansion, we then explore the existence of regions in parameter space where parametric excitation maybe advantageous compared to direct drive, which we label "parametric advantage". Analytical, experimental, and numerical verification demonstrates that parametric advantage can not exist if both pump and signal voltages are accounted for in the total voltage budget. This work determines non-dimensional scaling rules that can act as guidelines for selecting an optimal operating regime for degenerate parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic structures on polycarbonate via UV femtosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the fabrication of highly uniform laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on bulk polycarbonate (PC) using 258 nm femtosecond laser pulses. A systematic approach was pursued to investigate the influence of various laser parameters such as fluence, effective number of pulses, energy dose and polarisation on the features of the generated LIPSS. Experimental results showed that linearly polarized beams produce LIPSS with period comparable to the laser wavelength. Moreover, it was observed that the orientation of LIPSS is either parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization, depending on the excitation level. These features are similar to the LIPSS formed on dielectrics, despite the considerably higher absorption and larger extinction coefficient (~10-2) of polycarbonate at 258 nm. The orientation and features of the patterns at different excitation levels are explained using Sipe's theory, while the excitation and induced carrier densities were quantified through the application of a theoretical physical model that describes ultrafast dynamics in polymers. Furthermore, observations revealed that low excitation levels with linearly polarized enhance the uniformity of LIPSS, whereas irradiating PC targets with circularly polarized beams leads to the formation of microscale topographies decorated with protruding nanosphered-like structures, with their size varying based on the laser conditions. A detailed analysis of the impact of the induced topographies on their wetting and optical properties demonstrated a steady increase in hydrophilicity over time, in contrast to a modest increase in optical absorbance. The results regarding the morphological features and properties of the induced topographies on PC are anticipated to support future efforts in creating patterned surfaces on polymeric materials for potential applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled surface plasmon and resonant optical tunnelling in symmetric optical microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetrical structure consisting of a low refractive index dielectric layer between two metallic films, i.e. an optical cavity, surrounded by a semi-infinite dielectric medium of higher refractive index, forms an optical system capable of supporting both volume and surface resonances. The latter are associated with synchronized collective electronic oscillations in the inner surfaces of the two thin metallic films, called coupled surface plasmons. These oscillations are generated by an evanescent wave in the cavity and therefore the thickness of the cavity is limited to the micron range for visible radiation. Under suitable incident conditions, light propagating in the microcavity will resonate with these plasmonic oscillations and can be strongly transmitted into the surrounding medium. In this work, we establish a simple model of the transmission characteristics of the cavity and define resonance conditions that allow high transmittance even for inner dielectric layer thicknesses of various wavelengths. This phenomenon is an enhanced version of the optical process of frustrated total reflection between dielectrics analogous to quantum tunnelling effect. In the present situation, the phenomenon is more striking because it takes place in a system with two absorbing metal films which, under resonant conditions, favour a superior transmission.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Backward Volume Magnetostatic Spin Wave Vectors via the Spin Wave Doppler Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin waves (SWs) and their quanta, magnons, are essential to achieving low-power information transmission in future spintronic devices. Backward volume magnetostatic spin waves (BVMSWs) exhibit a unique dispersion relationship: one frequency corresponding to two distinct wave vectors. At low wave numbers, dipole-dipole interactions dominate, resulting in negative group velocities, whereas at high wave numbers, exchange interactions prevail, producing positive group velocities. This dual behavior complicates wave vector identification and obscures intrinsic spin-wave interactions. In this study, we propose an approach based on the spin wave Doppler effect to effectively distinguish different wave vectors. At low wave numbers, the inverse Doppler effect occurs due to antiparallel phase and group velocities, while at high wave numbers, a normal Doppler effect emerges from parallel velocities. This method not only clarifies the underlying spin-wave interactions but also help mitigate serious interference issues in the design of spin logic circuits.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast and Directional Magnetization Control via Voltage-Controlled Exchange Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast and energy-efficient electrically controlled magnetization switching is critical for next-generation spintronic devices. Voltage-driven switching offers an alternative to current-driven methods, significantly improving energy efficiency. Although voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC) has been proposed to switch magnetic states, its ultrafast response has not been experimentally verified. Here, we demonstrate that VCEC induces a directional exchange field that persists under nanosecond voltage pulses in a perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) with an exchange-coupled free layer. This establishes that VCEC can operate on ultrafast timescales with deterministic control over the switching polarity. The magnetization reversal is primarily assisted by voltage-induced magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), which transiently lowers the energy barrier. This combination enables magnetization switching within 87.5 ps with a 50% switching probability. The fast switching is attributed to enhanced magnetic relaxation of the free layer, facilitated by the exchange-coupled structure, which accelerates voltage-driven magnetization switching. These findings reveal that purely voltage-driven switching is viable for fast, bidirectional magnetization switching for future spintronic logic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>A Density Functional Theory Study of Magnetic Transition in MnO2 adsorbed Vanadium Carbide (V$_2$C) MXene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work reports nonmagnetic behavior (0.04 $\mu$B) in two-dimensional (2D) V2C-OF MXene and ferromagnetism in MnO$_2$ adsorbed V2C-OF MXene. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to study the magnetic moments of V$_2$C-OF and MnO$_2$@V$_2$C-OF MXene. The MXene, which is derived from the exfoliation of its parent V$_2$AlC MAX phase, shows a good potential to be a ferromagnetic when MnO$_2$ is adsorbed on it. The V$_2$C MXene and MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene were successfully synthesized, as characterized using X-ray diffraction, showing an increased c-lattice parameter from 22.6{\AA} to 27.2{\AA} after MnO$_2$ adsorption. The DFT study confirmed that MnO$_2$ adsorbed V$_2$C MXene changed from nonmagnetic (in V$_2$C MXene) to a strong ferromagnetic with a magnetic moment of 4.48$\mu$B for Mn adsorbed V$_2$C-OF MXene. The current work is a step-forward towards understanding of magnetism in two-dimensional materials for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Sliding wear: role of plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The experimental results are compared with a recently developed theory of sliding wear\cite{ToBe}. Our findings demonstrate that wear on surfaces with roughness below a critical threshold cannot result from crack propagation induced by frictional shear stress in block-substrate asperity contact regions and must, therefore, originate from a different mechanism.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-scale Cavities for Mid-infrared Radiation via Image Phonon Polariton Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface-polaritons play a pivotal role in strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale due to their ability to confine light to deep subwavelength dimensions. A promising class of materials exhibiting such polaritonic response are polar dielectrics, which support surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs). While SPhPs offer significantly lower losses compared to other polaritons, their potential has been underutilized due to limited ability to reach large continent factors. Here, we demonstrate a system composed of silver nanocubes deposited on a SiC polar dielectric, which experimentally realizes the antisymmetric-image-phonon-polaritons (AIPhPs) mode: a hybridized SPhPs mode that can confine mid-infrared radiation to extremely small mode-volumes, almost a billion times smaller than their free-space volume, with quality-factors an order-of-magnitude greater than those of surface-plasmons or graphene-plasmons, surpassing values of 180. Our method is general, scalable, and applicable to any polar dielectric, opening the path for controlling and manipulating strong light-matter interactions at the nanoscale in the long-wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Mechanical characterization of a membrane with an on-chip loss shield in a cryogenic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction of an rf/microwave signal to the optical domain, and vice versa, paves the way for technologies that exploit the advantages of each domain to perform quantum operations. Since electro-optomechanical devices implement a simultaneous coupling of a mechanical oscillator to both an rf/microwave field and an optical field, they are suitable for the realization of a quantum transducer. The membrane-in-the-middle setup is a possible solution, once its vibrational mode is cooled down to ultra cryogenic temperature for achieving quantum operation. This work is focused on the mechanical characterization via an optical interferometric probe, down to T=18mK, of a loss-shielded metalized membrane designed for this purpose. A stroboscopic technique has been exploited for revealing a mechanical quality factor up to 64 millions at the lowest temperature. In fact, with continuous illumination and a cryostat temperature below 1K, the heat due to optical absorption is not efficiently dissipated anymore, and the membrane remains hotter than its environment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing high-order harmonic generation in two-color laser fields: A comparison of single- and two-color schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in argon using 800--400 and 800--266~nm laser fields with their optimized single-color counterparts. We observe that the two-color fields generally outperform the single-color 800~nm field by factors of 2 to 3800, depending on the photon energy and generation scheme. From this comparison, we determine which scheme is optimal for each photon energy. We also observe that the divergence of HHG produced by the 800--266~nm laser fields is smaller than that of the other single- and two-color driving fields, perhaps suggesting that the 800--266~nm fields optimize the recombination probability of the so-called ``short" electron trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2x2 couplers are crucial in many photonics applications but are often wavelength-sensitive. Alternative designs could be large, complex, or lossy. We present a broadband ultra-compact adiabatic coupler with minimal coupling variation and the least silicon taper length of 1.44 um, to our best knowledge.</description>
