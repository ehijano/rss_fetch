      <title>A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</description>

      <title>NIC-RobustBench: A Comprehensive Open-Source Toolkit for Neural Image Compression and Robustness Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models (LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at https://github.com/msu-video-group/NIC-RobustBench.</description>

      <title>ASR-enhanced Multimodal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Product Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text, together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product retrieval.</description>
