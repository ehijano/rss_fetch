      <title>Sudden breakdown of effective field theory near cool Kerr-Newman black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Localization and resummation of unstable instantons in 2d Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the exact all-orders perturbative expansion for the partition function of 2d $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory on closed surfaces around higher critical points. We demonstrate that the expansion can be derived from the lattice partition function for all genera using a distributional generalization of the Poisson summation formula. We then recompute the expansion directly, using a stationary phase version of supersymmetric localization. The result of localization is a novel effective action which is itself a distribution rather than a function of the supersymmetric moduli. We comment on possible applications to A-twisted models and their analogs in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Carroll Hawking effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carroll black holes with an associated Carroll temperature were introduced recently. So far, it is unclear if they exhibit a Hawking-like effect. To solve this, we study scalar fields on Carroll black hole backgrounds. Inspired by anomaly methods, we derive a Hawking-like energy-momentum tensor compatible with the Carroll temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Key steps in our derivation are the finiteness of energy at the Carroll extremal surface and compatibility with the Carroll Ward identities, thereby eliminating, respectively, the Carroll-analogs of the Boulware and Unruh vacua.</description>

      <title>The Odd 2D Bubbles, 4D Triangles, and Einstein and Weyl Anomalies in 2D Gravitational Fermionic amplitudes: The Role of Breaking Integration Linearity for Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated Relations Among Green Functions defined in an alternative strategy for coping with the divergences, also called the Implicit Regularization Method (IREG): the mathematical content (divergent and finite) will remain intact until the calculations end. The divergent part will be organized through standardized objects free of physical quantities. In contrast, the finite part is projected in a class of well-behaved functions that carry all the amplitudes' physical content. That relations arise in fermionic amplitudes in even space-time dimensions, where anomalous tensors connect to finite amplitudes as in the bubbles and triangles in two and four dimensions. Those tensors depend on surface terms, whose non-zero values arise from finite amplitudes as requirements of consistency with the linearity of integration and uniqueness. Maintaining these terms implies breaking momentum-space homogeneity and, in a later step, the Ward identities. Meanwhile, eliminating them allows more than one mathematical expression for the same amplitude. That is a consequence of choices related to the involved Dirac traces. Independently of divergences, it is impossible to satisfy all symmetry implications by simultaneously requiring vanishing surface terms and linearity. Then we approach the 1-loop level fermionic correction for the propagation of the graviton in a space-time D=1+1 through the action of a Weyl fermion in curved space-time. In this context, gravitational anomalies arise, and the amplitudes investigated have the highest degree of divergence quadratic. That imposes a substantial algebraic effort; however, the conclusions are in agreement with the non-gravitational amplitudes. At the end of the calculations, we show how it is possible to fix the value of the divergent part through the relations imposed for amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Worldline approach for spinor fields in manifolds with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldline formalism is a useful scheme in Quantum Field Theory which has also become a powerful tool for numerical computations. It is based on the first quantization of an auxiliary point-particle whose transition amplitudes correspond to the heat-kernel of the operator of quantum fluctuations of the field theory. However, to study a quantum field theory in a bounded manifold one needs to restrict the path integration domain of the auxiliary point-particle to a specific subset of worldlines enclosed by those boundaries. In the present article it is shown how to implement this restriction for the case of a spinor field in a two-dimensional curved half-plane under MIT bag boundary conditions, and compute the first few heat-kernel coefficients as a verification of the proposed construction. This construction admits several generalisations.</description>

      <title>Gauge equivalence of 1+1 Calogero-Moser-Sutherland field theory and higher rank trigonometric Landau-Lifshitz model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical integrable 1+1 trigonometric ${\rm gl}_N$ Landau-Lifshitz models constructed by means of quantum $R$-matrices satisfying also the associative Yang-Baxter equation. It is shown that 1+1 field analogue of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland model is gauge equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz model, which arises from the Antonov-Hasegawa-Zabrodin trigonometric non-standard $R$-matrix. The latter generalizes the Cherednik's 7-vertex $R$-matrix in ${\rm GL}_2$ case to the case of ${\rm GL}_N$. Explicit change of variables between the 1+1 models is obtained.</description>

      <title>Amplitude modulations and resonant decay of excited oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the decay of strongly excited oscillons in a single vacuum model reveals a chaotic, fractal-like pattern very much like one found in kink-antikink collision in the $\phi^4$ model. This structure can be attributed to the resonant energy transfer mechanism triggered by the modulations of amplitudes of constituent oscillons which form the excited oscillon. We also find evidence that such modulations arise as a motion of two quasi-breathers inside the constituent oscillon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a cyclic Universe: resilience through cycles and vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalised calculation for the spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations in a cyclic Universe, making no assumptions about the vacuum state of the theory and accounting for the contribution of tensor modes produced in the dark energy phase of the previous cycle. We show that these modes have minimal impact on the spectrum observed in the current cycle, except for corrections on scales as large as the comoving Hubble radius today. These corrections are due to sub-horizon modes produced towards the end of the dark energy phase, persisting into the ekpyrotic phase of the next cycle as additional quanta. In relation to the vacuum state, we argue that non-Bunch-Davies quanta can easily overwhelm the energy density driving the dark energy phase, potentially compromising the model. Therefore, avoiding backreaction effects sets restrictive constraints on deviations away from the Bunch-Davies vacuum during this phase, limiting the overall freedom to consider alternative vacua in the cyclic Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Carroll-invariant theories with fields propagating outside the Carroll lightcone, i.e., at a speed strictly greater than zero (`Carroll swiftons'). We first consider models in flat Carroll spacetime in general dimensions, where we present scalar and vector Carroll swifton field theories. We then turn to the coupling to gravity and achieve in particular in two dimensions a Carroll invariant scalar swifton by coupling it suitably to Carroll dilaton gravity. Its backreaction on the geometry generates dynamical torsion.</description>

      <title>From spectral to scattering form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel indicator for chaotic quantum scattering processes, the scattering form factor (ScFF). It is based on mapping the locations of peaks in the scattering amplitude to random matrix eigenvalues, and computing the analog of the spectral form factor (SFF). We compute the spectral and scattering form factors of several non-chaotic systems. We determine the ScFF associated with the phase shifts of the leaky torus, closely related to the distribution of the zeros of Riemann zeta function. We compute the ScFF for the decay amplitude of a highly excited string states into two tachyons. We show that it displays the universal features expected from random matrix theory - a decline, a ramp and a plateau - and is in general agreement with the Gaussian unitary ensemble. It also shows some new features, owning to the special structure of the string amplitude, including a "bump" before the ramp associated with gaps in the average eigenvalue density. The "bump" is removed for highly excited string states with an appropriate state dependent unfolding. We also discuss the SFF for the Gaussian $\beta$- ensemble, writing an interpolation between the known results of the Gaussian orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic ensembles.</description>

      <title>A study of anomalies using functional integration and perturbative calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two lines of investigation involving anomalies. First, we review mechanisms behind the classical and quantum conservation of symmetries using functional integration. This discussion clarifies conditions for quantum violations, as acknowledged in chiral theories. Then, we elucidate the subject of gauge anomaly cancellation when all fields are quantized. Such an outcome requires gauge invariance of the bosonic measure, so our first object is proving this invariance within Fujikawa's approach. Second, we investigate anomalies in fermionic perturbative amplitudes using Implicit Regularization. The discussion of the single-axial triangle fundaments this analysis, bringing the elements necessary to approach the single-axial box. When organizing their mathematical structure, we highlight the role of traces involving the chiral matrix. Choosing a specific expression for them reflects on the position of symmetry violations, which has implications regarding the linearity of integration. Power counting and tensor structure imply the presence of surface terms related to momenta ambiguities. We present the results without computing these surface terms. In this neutral perspective, we explore possibilities achieved under different prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Covariance and symmetry algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity as well as gauge theories, non-trivial symmetries can appear at boundaries. In the presence of radiation some of the symmetries are not Hamiltonian vector fields, hence the definition of charges for the symmetries becomes delicate. It can lead to the problem of field-dependent 2-cocycles in the charge algebra, as opposed to the central extensions allowed in standard classical mechanics. We show that if the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, its covariance requirement guarantees that the algebra of Noether currents is free of field-dependent 2-cocycles, and its stationarity requirement further removes central extensions. Therefore the charge algebra admits at most a time-independent field-dependent 2-cocycle, whose existence depends on the boundary conditions. We report on new results for asymptotic symmetries at future null infinity that can be derived with this approach.</description>

      <title>The QCD theta-parameter in canonical quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of the QCD theta-parameter is investigated in pure Yang-Mills theory in the spacetime given by the four-dimensional Euclidean torus. While in this setting the introduction of possibly unphysical boundary conditions is avoided, it must be specified how the sum over the topological sectors is to be carried out. To connect with observables in real time, we perceive the partition function as the trace over the canonical density matrix. The system then corresponds to one of a finite temperature on a spatial three-torus. Carrying out the trace operation requires canonical quantization and gauge fixing. Fixing the gauge and demanding that the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is maintained leads to a restriction of the Hilbert space of physical wave functionals that generalizes the constraints derived from imposing Gauss' law. Consequently, we find that the states in the Hilbert space are properly normalizable under an inner product that integrates over each physical configuration represented by the gauge potential one time and one time only. The observables derived from the constrained Hilbert space do not violate charge-parity symmetry. We note that an exact hidden symmetry of the theory that is present for arbitrary values of theta in the Hamiltonian is effectively promoted to parity conservation in this constrained space. These results, derived on a torus in order to avoid the introduction of boundary conditions, also carry over to Minkowski spacetime when taking account of all possible gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>SymTFT out of equilibrium: from time crystals to braided drives and Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17176v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is a framework to capture universal features of quantum many-body systems by viewing them as a boundary of topological order in one higher dimension. This has yielded numerous insights in static low-energy settings. Here we study what SymTFT can reveal about nonequilibrium, focusing on one-dimensional (1D) periodically driven systems and their 2D SymTFTs. In driven settings, boundary conditions (BCs) can be dynamical and can apply both spatially and temporally. We show how this enters SymTFT via topological operators, which we then use to uncover several new results. These include revealing time crystals (TCs) as systems with symmetry-twisted temporal BCs, robust bulk ``dual TCs" in phases thought to be only boundary TCs, generating drive dualities, or identifying 2D Floquet codes as space-time duals to 1D systems with duality-twisted spatial BCs. We also show how, by making duality-twisted BCs dynamical, non-Abelian braiding of duality defects can enter SymTFT, leading to effects such as the exact pumping of symmetry charges between a system and its BCs. We illustrate our ideas for $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 1D systems, but our construction applies for any finite Abelian symmetry.</description>

      <title>Casimir Physics beyond the Proximity Force Approximation: The Derivative Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the derivative expansion (DE) method in Casimir physics, an approach which extends the proximity force approximation (PFA). After introducing and motivating the DE in contexts other than the Casimir effect, we present different examples which correspond to that realm. We focus on different particular geometries, boundary conditions, types of fields, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Besides providing various examples where the method can be applied, we discuss a concrete example for which the DE cannot be applied; namely, the case of perfect Neumann conditions in 2 + 1 dimensions. By the same example, we show how a more realistic type of boundary condition circumvents the problem. We also comment on the application of the DE to the Casimir-Polder interaction which provides a broader perspective on particle-surface interactions.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflation in light of the NANOGrav 15 year data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in non-minimal coupling Gauss-Bonnet inflationary model in the presence of power-law potentials. We employ a two part coupling function to enhance primordial curvatures at small scales as well as satisfy Planck measurements at the CMB scale. Moreover, our model satisfies the swampland criteria. We find PBHs with different mass scales and demonstrate that PBHs with masses around $\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})M_{\odot}$ can account for almost all of the dark matter in the universe. In addition, we investigate the implications of the reheating stage and show that the PBHs in our model are generated during the radiation-dominated era. Furthermore, we investigate the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs). More interestingly enough, is that for the specific cases $D_{\rm n}$ in our model, the GWs can be considered as a source of NANOGrav signal. %evaluate the idea that the induced GWs propagating concurrently with the PBH production are the source of NANOGrav signal. Also, we conclude that the GWs energy density parameter at the nano-Hz regime can be parameterized as $\Omega_{\rm GW_0} (f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$, where the obtained $\gamma$ is consistent with the NANOGrav 15 years data.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension, has been investigated. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$-gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain a new exact solution for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the heterotic G$_2$ system on almost contact metric manifolds with reduced characteristic holonomy. We focus on $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds and $(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds, the latter being a convenient reformulation of spin $\eta$-Einstein $\alpha$-Sasaki manifolds. Investigating a $1$-parameter family of G$_2$-connections on the tangent bundle, we obtain several approximate solutions as well as one new class of exact solutions on degenerate $3$-$(\alpha,\delta)$-Sasaki manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the structures and methods in the theory of causal fermion systems with approaches to fundamental physics based on division algebras, in particular the octonions. We find that octonions and, more generally, tensor products of division algebras come up naturally to describe the symmetries of the vacuum configuration of a causal fermion system. This is achieved by associating the real and imaginary octonion basis elements with the neutrino and charged sectors of the vacuum fermionic projector, respectively. Conversely, causal fermion systems provide octonionic theories with spacetime structures and dynamical equations via the causal action principle. In this way, octonionic theories and causal fermion systems complement each other.</description>

      <title>Dual symmetries of dense three and two-color QCD and some QCD-like NJL models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper the symmetry properties of the phase diagram of dense quark matter composed of $u$ and $d$ quarks with two or three colors has been investigated in the framework of massless (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and QCD models. It turns out that in the presence of baryon $\mu_B$, isospin $\mu_I$, chiral $\mu_5$ and chiral isospin $\mu_{I5}$ chemical potentials the Lagrangians of these models are invariant under the so-called dual transformations. Consequently, the entire NJL model (or QCD) thermodynamic potentials are dually symmetric. In particular, it means that in the total $(\mu_B,\mu_I,\mu_5,\mu_{I5})$-phase portraits of these models the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and charged pion condensation (PC) phases are arranged dually conjugated (or symmetrical) to each other (in the case of three-color models). Whereas in the case of two-color quark matter, these models predict the entire phase structure in which there are dual symmetries between CSB, charged PC and baryon superfluid phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joyce structures were introduced by T. Bridgeland in the context of the space of stability conditions of a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau category and its associated Donaldson-Thomas invariants. In subsequent work, T. Bridgeland and I. Strachan showed that Joyce structures satisfying a certain non-degeneracy condition encode a complex hyperk\"{a}hler structure on the tangent bundle of the base of the Joyce structure. In this work we give a definition of an analogous structure over an affine special K\"{a}hler (ASK) manifold, which we call a special Joyce structure. Furthermore, we show that it encodes a real hyperk\"{a}hler (HK) structure on the tangent bundle of the ASK manifold, possibly of indefinite signature. Particular examples include the semi-flat HK metric associated to an ASK manifold (also known as the rigid c-map metric) and the HK metrics associated to certain uncoupled variations of BPS structures over the ASK manifold. Finally, we relate the HK metrics coming from special Joyce structures to HK metrics on the total space of algebraic integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0711.3992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of Chern-Simons-like term induction via quantum corrections in four-dimensions is investigated in two different cases. In the first case, we consider two distinct approaches to deal with the exact fermion propagator of the extended QED theory up to the first order in the $b$-coefficient. We find different results for distinct approaches in the same regularization scheme. In the second case, we show that when we use a modified derivative expansion method and another regularization scheme, we obtain a result that exactly coincides with one of the results obtained in the former case. This seems to imply an ambiguity absence as one treats the fermion propagator and the self-energy tensor properly.</description>

Abstract: We study five-point correlation functions of scalar operators in d-dimensional conformal field theories. We develop a new approach to computing the five-point conformal blocks for exchanged primary operators of arbitrary spin by introducing a generalization of radial coordinates, using an appropriate ansatz, and perturbatively solving two quadratic Casimir differential equations. We then study five-point correlators $\langle \sigma \sigma \epsilon \sigma \sigma \rangle$ in the critical 3d Ising model. We truncate the operator product expansions (OPEs) in the correlator by including a finite number of primary operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta \leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We then compute several OPE coefficients involving $\epsilon$ and two spinning operators by demanding that the truncated correlator approximately satisfies the crossing relation.</description>

      <title>Tensor Perturbations from Bounce Inflation Scenario in f(Q) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a bounce inflation cosmological scenario in the framework of the modified symmetric teleparallel gravity, namely f(Q) theory, and investigate the tensor perturbations therein. As is well-known, the tensor perturbations generated in the very early Universe (inflation and pre-inflation regions) can account for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) that are to be detected by the next generation of GW experiments. We discuss the stability condition of the tensor perturbations in the bounce inflation process and investigate in detail the evolution of the perturbation variable. The general form of the tensor power spectrum is obtained both for large as well as small scale modes. As a result, we show for both kinds of modes (short or long wavelength modes), and the tensor spectrum may get a positive tilt in the parametric range where the tensor perturbation proves to be stable -- this interestingly hints an enhancement of gravitational waves' amplitude in the background of the f(Q) bounce-inflation scenario. Moreover, we study the LQC-like scenario as a specific case of our model, in which, the primordial tensor power spectrum turns out to be nearly scale-invariant on both small and large scales.</description>

Abstract: We perform a high-precision computation of the three-loop three-point form factor of the stress-tensor supermultiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Both the leading-color and non-leading-color form factors are expanded in terms of simple integrals. We compute the complete set of integrals at a special kinematic point with very high precision using $\mathtt{AMFlow}$. The high-precision leading-color result enables us to obtain the analytic form of a numerical constant in the three-loop BDS ansatz, which is previously known only numerically. The high-precision values of the non-leading-color finite remainder as well as all integrals are also presented, which can be valuable for future use.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

Abstract: Saddle point approximation is a useful method to explore high energy asymptotic behaviors of string scattering amplitudes. We show that, even at tree-level, there are infinitely many complex saddles contributing to string scattering amplitudes, and that the complex saddles reproduce their appropriate poles and zeros. Each complex saddle is interpreted as a semi-classical path of a string in Lorentzian signature. The poles and zeros of the Veneziano amplitude are understood as constructive or destructive interference of such semi-classical paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a classical version of the loop corrected soft graviton theorem and we use it to compute the universal part of the one-loop (2PM) waveform up to sub-subleading order in the energy $\omega$ of the emitted graviton for spinless black-hole scattering. In particular, we compute the action of the soft operators on the classically resummed four-point amplitude, that can be written in terms of the exponential of the eikonal phase (and is therefore non-perturbative in the Newton's constant $G_N$) and then we perform the usual PM expansion in powers of $G_N$ . We find perfect agreement with the existing 2PM literature at the orders $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$ and $\omega\log^2\omega$, which are universal. Furthermore, we use this method to compute the universal part of the $\omega\log\omega$ contribution to the 2PM waveform. Even if in the present analysis we limit ourselves to compute the soft 2PM waveform, our general formulae can be used to extract all universal PM orders of the terms connected with the infrared divergences, once the impulse at the corresponding precision is known. Our approach, based on the resummed eikonal amplitude, gives a unified picture of the various computations of the classical soft graviton behaviour that are present in the literature since the seminal paper by Weinberg in 1965.</description>

Abstract: Poisson electrodynamics is the low-energy limit of a rank-one noncommutative gauge theory. It admits a closed formulation in terms of a Poisson structure on the space-time manifold and reproduces ordinary classical electrodynamics in the commutative limit. In this paper, we address and solve the problem of minimal coupling to charged matter fields with a proper commutative limit. Our construction essentially relies on the geometry of symplectic groupoids and works for all integrable Poisson manifolds. An additional advantage of our approach is that the corresponding Lagrangians can be defined on an arbitrary metric background.</description>

Abstract: We fill some of existed gaps in the correspondence between Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the Inverse Scattering Transform by extending the consideration to the case of paired stationary and non-stationary Hamiltonians. We formulate the corresponding to the case Goursat problem and explicitly construct the kernel of the non-local Inverse Scattering Transform, which solves it. As a result, we find the way of constructing non-hermitian Hamiltonians from the initially hermitian ones, that leads, in the case of real-valued spectra of both potentials, to pairing of ${\cal CPT/PT}$-invariant Hamiltonians. The relevance of our proposal to Quantum Optics and optical waveguides technology, as well as to non-linear dynamics and Black Hole Physics is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: BHK mirror symmetry as introduced by Berglund--H\"ubsch and Marc Krawitz between Landau--Ginzburg (LG) models has been the topic of much study in recent years. An LG model is determined by a potential function and a group of symmetries. BHK mirror symmetry is only valid when the group of symmetries is comprised of the so-called diagonal symmetries. Recently, an extension to BHK mirror symmetry to include nonabelian symmetry groups has been conjectured. In this article, we provide a mirror map at the level of state spaces between the LG A-model state space and the LG B-model state space for the mirror model predicted by the BHK mirror symmetry extension for nonabelian LG models. We introduce two technical conditions, the Diagonal Scaling Condition, and the Equivariant $\Phi$ condition, under which a bi-degree preserving isomorphism of state spaces (the mirror map) is guaranteed to exist, and we prove that the condition is always satisfied if the permutation part of the group is cyclic of prime order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that nonlinear electrodynamics of the Born--Infeld theory type may be exploited to shed insight into a few fundamental problems in theoretical physics, including rendering electromagnetic asymmetry to energetically exclude magnetic monopoles, achieving finite electromagnetic energy to relegate curvature singularities of charged black holes, and providing theoretical interpretation of equations of state of cosmic fluids via k-essence cosmology. Also discussed are some nonlinear differential equation problems.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck-Verdier duality in categories of bimodules and weak module functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various monoidal categories, including suitable representation categories of vertex operator algebras, admit natural Grothendieck-Verdier duality structures. We recall that such a Grothendieck-Verdier category comes with two tensor products which should be related by distributors obeying pentagon identities. We discuss in which circumstances these distributors are isomorphisms. This is achieved by taking the perspective of module categories over monoidal categories, using in particular the natural weak module functor structure of internal Homs and internal coHoms. As an illustration, we exhibit these concepts concretely in the case of categories of bimodules over associative algebras.</description>

      <title>Negative radiation pressure in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-component non-linear Schr\"odinger equations, the force exerted by incident monochromatic plane waves on an embedded dark soliton and on dark-bright-type solitons is investigated, both perturbatively and by numerical simulations. When the incoming wave is non-vanishing only in the orthogonal component to that of the embedded dark soliton, its acceleration is in the opposite direction to that of the incoming wave. This somewhat surprising phenomenon can be attributed to the well known "negative effective mass" of the dark soliton. When a dark-bright soliton, whose effective mass is also negative, is hit by an incoming wave non-vanishing in the component corresponding to the dark soliton, the direction of its acceleration coincides with that of the incoming wave. This implies that the net force acting on it is in the opposite direction to that of the incoming wave. This rather counter-intuitive effect is a yet another manifestation of negative radiation pressure exerted by the incident wave, observed in other systems. When a dark-bright soliton interacts with an incoming wave in the component of the bright soliton, it accelerates in the opposite direction, hence the force is "pushing" it now. We expect that these remarkable effects, in particular the negative radiation pressure, can be experimentally verified in Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Euclidean and Hamiltonian thermodynamics for regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Hayward regular black hole using both Euclidean path integral and Hamiltonian methods, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter, Minkowski, and de Sitter spacetimes. With the inclusion of matter fields which act as a source for the regular black hole geometry, an effective temperature emerges that differs from the conventional definition related to the Killing surface gravity. We posit that this temperature is the appropriate choice for studying thermodynamic phenomena, by demonstrating consistency between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian formulations in the appropriate limits. We examine the thermodynamic properties and phase structure of the Hayward black hole in the canonical ensemble and show that, counter to some earlier indications, standard mean-field theory critical behavior is observed when the cosmological constant is treated as a thermodynamic pressure. We note the absence of a Hawking-Page transition, and conjecture that quantum gravity corrections which are suitably strong to regulate the Schwarzschild singularity generically prevent the transition from occurring. We also show that the Smarr relation remains linear in all cases, despite the absence of a linearity proof for nonlinear electrodynamic theories with nonsymmetry inheriting fields.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of particle mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective field theory to study \emph{indirect} mixing of two fields induced by their couplings to a common decay channel in a medium. The extension of the method of Lee, Oehme and Yang, the cornerstone of analysis of CP violation in flavored mesons, to include mixing of particles with different masses provides a guide to and benchmark for the effective field theory. The analysis reveals subtle caveats in the description of mixing in terms of the widely used non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, more acute in the non-degenerate case. The effective field theory describes the dynamics of field mixing where the common intermediate states populate a bath in thermal equilibrium, as an \emph{open quantum system}. We obtain the effective action up to second order in the couplings, where indirect mixing is a consequence of off-diagonal self-energy components. We find that if only one of the mixing fields features an initial expectation value, indirect mixing induces an expectation value of the other field. The equal time two point correlation functions exhibit asymptotic approach to a stationary thermal state, and the emergence of long-lived \emph{bath induced} coherence which display quantum beats as a consequence of interference of quasinormal modes in the medium. The amplitudes of the quantum beats are resonantly enhanced in the nearly degenerate case with potential observational consequences.</description>

      <title>A unified description of DGLAP, CSS, and BFKL: TMD factorization bridging large and small x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization scheme designed to unify both large and small Bjorken-x regimes. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the gluon TMD operator for an unpolarized hadron within this proposed scheme. This leads to the emergence of a new TMD evolution, incorporating those in transverse momentum, rapidity, and Bjorken-x. When matched to the collinear factorization scheme, our factorization scheme faithfully reproduces the well-established Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolutions. Conversely, matching with high-energy factorization not only yields the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution but also reveals distinctive signatures of CSS logarithms. The development of this novel TMD factorization scheme, capable of seamlessly reconciling disparate Bjorken-x regimes and faithfully reproducing established QCD evolution equations, has the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of high-energy processes and three-dimensional parton structures of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Identifying gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems by Biorthogonal Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gap-closings in one- and two-dimensional tight-binding models with two bands, containing non-Hermitian hopping terms, and open boundary conditions (OBCs) imposed along one direction. We compare the bulk OBC spectra with the periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra, pointing out that they do not coincide, which is an intrinsic characteristic of non-Hermitian systems. The non-Hermiticity, thus, results in the failure of the familiar notions of bulk-boundary correspondence found for Hermitian systems. This necessitates the search for topological invariants which can characterize gap-closings in open non-Hermitian systems correctly and unambiguously. We elucidate the behaviour of two possible candidates applicable for one-dimensional slices -- (1) the sum of winding numbers for the two bands defined on a generalized Brillouin zone and (2) the biorthogonal polarization (BP). While the former shows jumps/discontinuities for some of the non-Hermitian systems studied here, at points when an edge mode enters the bulk states and becomes delocalized, it does not maintain quantized values in a given topological phase. On the contrary, BP shows jumps at phase transitions, and takes the quantized value of one or zero, which corresponds to whether an actual edge mode exists or whether that mode is delocalized and absorbed within the bulk (not being an edge mode anymore).</description>

      <title>Horizons and Null Infinity: A Fugue in 4 voices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole horizons in equilibrium and null infinity of asymptotically flat space-times are null 3-manifolds but have very different physical connotations. We first show that they share a large number of geometric properties, making them both weakly isolated horizons. We then use this new unified perspective to unravel the origin of the drastic differences in the physics they contain. Interestingly, the themes are woven together in a manner reminiscent of voices in a fugue.</description>

      <title>Non commutative classical and Quantum fractionary Cosmology: FRW case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we shall explore the effects of non commutativity in fractional classical and quantum schemes using the flat Friedmmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model coupled to a scalar field in the K-essence formalism. In previous work we have obtained the commutative solutions in both regimes into the fractional framework. Here we introduce noncommutative variables, considering that all minisuperspace variables $\rm q^i_{nc}$ do not commute, so the symplectic structure was modified. In the quantum regime, the probability density presents new structure in the scalar field corresponding to the value of the non-commutative parameter, in the sense that this probability density undergoes a shift back to the direction of the scale factor, causing classical evolution to arise earlier than in the commutative world.</description>
