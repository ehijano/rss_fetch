      <title>Forbush Decreases during strong Geomagnetic Storms: Time Delays, Rigidity Effects, and ICME-Driven Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between Forbush decreases (FDs) and associated geomagnetic storms, and their links to interplanetary solar wind parameters, using high-resolution minute data. FDs are classified by main-phase decrease steps and analyzed with superposed epoch analysis. Fast, turbulent, high-field sheath structures occur before and during coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven FDs, whereas corotating interaction region events show delayed amplification and more perturbed dynamics. Time lags between FD and storm onsets are examined for space weather forecasting. FD amplitude correlates more strongly with moderate and strong CME-driven storms than with extreme storms, likely due to complex magnetospheric responses from successive events and prolonged southward IMF Bz. Events with fast shocks and sheath regions show stronger correlations than those without shocks. Energy dependence, derived from twelve neutron monitor stations worldwide, reveals a two-step linear rigidity spectrum: sharp FD amplitude decrease at low rigidity and a more gradual drop at higher rigidity.</description>

      <title>Replicating the flyby sampling of salty ocean world ice grains using impact ionization mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Europa Clipper mission will arrive at the Jovian system in 2030 and analyze ice grains sourced from the icy material on its surface using impact mass spectrometry, which will provide key constraints on Europa's chemical composition and habitability. However, deriving quantitative compositional information from spaceborne impact mass spectra of ice grains has historically proven difficult due to the confounding effects of composition and impact velocity, coupled with difficulties in accelerating ice grains to spacecraft velocities under analogous sampling conditions. Using a novel hypervelocity ice grain acceleration and impact mass spectrometry method, we quantify the degree to which the mass spectra of NaCl-rich ice grains are influenced by chemical composition and impact velocity variations within the flyby velocity ranges planned for the Europa Clipper mission. These results suggest that high-fidelity studies quantifying composition and velocity-related effects in impact mass spectra may be necessary to accurately interpret data collected at Europa and other ocean worlds in the future.</description>
