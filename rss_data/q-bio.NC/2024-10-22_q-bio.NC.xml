      <title>Brain-Aware Readout Layers in GNNs: Advancing Alzheimer's early Detection and Neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory and cognitive decline, affecting millions worldwide. Diagnosing AD is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and variable progression. This study introduces a novel brain-aware readout layer (BA readout layer) for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), designed to improve interpretability and predictive accuracy in neuroimaging for early AD diagnosis. By clustering brain regions based on functional connectivity and node embedding, this layer improves the GNN's capability to capture complex brain network characteristics. We analyzed neuroimaging data from 383 participants, including both cognitively normal and preclinical AD individuals, using T1-weighted MRI, resting-state fMRI, and FBB-PET to construct brain graphs. Our results show that GNNs with the BA readout layer significantly outperform traditional models in predicting the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) score, demonstrating higher robustness and stability. The adaptive BA readout layer also offers enhanced interpretability by highlighting task-specific brain regions critical to cognitive functions impacted by AD. These findings suggest that our approach provides a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and analysis of Alzheimer's disease.</description>

      <title>Learning Cortico-Muscular Dependence through Orthonormal Decomposition of Density Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cortico-spinal neural pathway is fundamental for motor control and movement execution, and in humans it is typically studied using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. However, current approaches for capturing high-level and contextual connectivity between these recordings have important limitations. Here, we present a novel application of statistical dependence estimators based on orthonormal decomposition of density ratios to model the relationship between cortical and muscle oscillations. Our method extends from traditional scalar-valued measures by learning eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and projection spaces of density ratios from realizations of the signal, addressing the interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence of cortico-muscular connectivity. We experimentally demonstrate that eigenfunctions learned from cortico-muscular connectivity can accurately classify movements and subjects. Moreover, they reveal channel and temporal dependencies that confirm the activation of specific EEG channels during movement.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of High-Density Surface EMG: Novel Non-Invasive High-Yield Motor Unit Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition of high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) signals into motor unit discharge patterns has become a powerful tool for investigating the neural control of movement, providing insights into motor neuron recruitment and discharge behavior. However, current algorithms, while very effective under certain conditions, face significant challenges in complex scenarios, as their accuracy and motor unit yield are highly dependent on anatomical differences among individuals. This can limit the number of decomposed motor units, particularly in challenging conditions. To address this issue, we recently introduced Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition (SCD), which dynamically adjusts the separation function based on the distribution of the data and prevents convergence to the same source. Initially applied to intramuscular EMG signals, SCD is here adapted for HD-sEMG signals. We demonstrated its ability to address key challenges faced by existing methods, particularly in identifying low-amplitude motor unit action potentials and effectively handling complex decomposition scenarios, like high-interference signals. We extensively validated SCD using simulated and experimental HD-sEMG recordings and compared it with current state-of-the-art decomposition methods under varying conditions, including different excitation levels, noise intensities, force profiles, sexes, and muscle groups. The proposed method consistently outperformed existing techniques in both the quantity of decoded motor units and the precision of their firing time identification. For instance, under certain experimental conditions, SCD detected more than three times as many motor units compared to previous methods, while also significantly improving accuracy. These advancements represent a major step forward in non-invasive EMG technology for studying motor unit activity in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Latency correction in sparse neuronal spike trains with overlapping global events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In Kreuz et al., J Neurosci Methods 381, 109703 (2022) two methods were proposed that perform latency correction, i.e., optimize the spike time alignment of sparse neuronal spike trains with well defined global spiking events. The first one based on direct shifts is fast but uses only partial latency information, while the other one makes use of the full information but relies on the computationally costly simulated annealing. Both methods reach their limits and can become unreliable when successive global events are not sufficiently separated or even overlap.
  New Method: Here we propose an iterative scheme that combines the advantages of the two original methods by using in each step as much of the latency information as possible and by employing a very fast extrapolation direct shift method instead of the much slower simulated annealing.
  Results: We illustrate the effectiveness and the improved performance, measured in terms of the relative shift error, of the new iterative scheme not only on simulated data with known ground truths but also on single-unit recordings from two medial superior olive neurons of a gerbil.
  Comparison with Existing Method(s): The iterative scheme outperforms the existing approaches on both the simulated and the experimental data. Due to its low computational demands, and in contrast to simulated annealing, it can also be applied to very large datasets.
  Conclusions: The new method generalizes and improves on the original method both in terms of accuracy and speed. Importantly, it is the only method that allows to disentangle global events with overlap.</description>

      <title>The shape of the brain's connections is predictive of cognitive performance: an explainable machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape of the brain's white matter connections is relatively unexplored in diffusion MRI tractography analysis. While it is known that tract shape varies in populations and across the human lifespan, it is unknown if the variability in dMRI tractography-derived shape may relate to the brain's functional variability across individuals. This work explores the potential of leveraging tractography fiber cluster shape measures to predict subject-specific cognitive performance. We implement machine learning models to predict individual cognitive performance scores. We study a large-scale database from the HCP-YA study. We apply an atlas-based fiber cluster parcellation to the dMRI tractography of each individual. We compute 15 shape, microstructure, and connectivity features for each fiber cluster. Using these features as input, we train a total of 210 models to predict 7 different NIH Toolbox cognitive performance assessments. We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess the importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate that shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The studied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area, volume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure and connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape feature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from an idealized cylinder. Further interpretation using SHAP values suggest that fiber clusters with features highly predictive of cognitive ability are widespread throughout the brain, including fiber clusters from the superficial association, deep association, cerebellar, striatal, and projection pathways. This study demonstrates the strong potential of shape descriptors to enhance the study of the brain's white matter and its relationship to cognitive function.</description>

      <title>Discriminating image representations with principal distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image representations (artificial or biological) are often compared in terms of their global geometry; however, representations with similar global structure can have strikingly different local geometries. Here, we propose a framework for comparing a set of image representations in terms of their local geometries. We quantify the local geometry of a representation using the Fisher information matrix, a standard statistical tool for characterizing the sensitivity to local stimulus distortions, and use this as a substrate for a metric on the local geometry in the vicinity of a base image. This metric may then be used to optimally differentiate a set of models, by finding a pair of "principal distortions" that maximize the variance of the models under this metric. We use this framework to compare a set of simple models of the early visual system, identifying a novel set of image distortions that allow immediate comparison of the models by visual inspection. In a second example, we apply our method to a set of deep neural network models and reveal differences in the local geometry that arise due to architecture and training types. These examples highlight how our framework can be used to probe for informative differences in local sensitivities between complex computational models, and suggest how it could be used to compare model representations with human perception.</description>

      <title>The role of spike-timing-dependent plasticity and random inputs in neurodegenerative diseases and neuromorphic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal oscillations are related to symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The random inputs could affect such oscillations in the brain states that translate collective activities of neurons interconnected via synaptic connections. In this paper, we study coupled effects of channels and synaptic dynamics under the stochastic influence, together with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of healthy brain cells with applications to Parkinson's disease (PD). In particular, we investigate the effects of random inputs and input correlations in a subthalamic nucleus (STN) cell membrane potential model. Our numerical results show that the random inputs strongly affect the spiking activities of the STN neuron not only in the case of healthy cells but also in the case of PD cells in the presence of DBS treatment. The STDP increases the interspike interval (ISI) regularity of spike trains of the output neurons. However, the existence of a random refractory period and random input current in the system may substantially influence an increased irregularity of spike trains of the output neurons. Furthermore, the presence of the stochastic influence together with spike-timing-dependent plasticity could increase the correlation of the neurons. These effects would potentially contribute to the management of PD symptoms.</description>

      <title>Modeling dynamic neural activity by combining naturalistic video stimuli and stimulus-independent latent factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain processes dynamic natural stimuli remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Current dynamic neural encoding models either take stimuli as input but ignore shared variability in neural responses, or they model this variability by deriving latent embeddings from neural responses or behavior while ignoring the visual input. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic model that incorporates video inputs along with stimulus-independent latent factors to capture variability in neuronal responses, predicting a joint distribution for the entire population. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we found that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves further improvements when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior, although the model was trained without behavior data.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Exploration of Circle of Willis for CTA and MRA: Segmentation, Detection, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) vessels is critical to connecting major circulations of the brain. The topology of the vascular structure is clinical significance to evaluate the risk, severity of the neuro-vascular diseases. The CoW has two representative angiographic imaging modalities, computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). TopCow24 provided 125 paired CTA-MRA dataset for the analysis of CoW. To explore both CTA and MRA images in a unified framework to learn the inherent topology of Cow, we construct the universal dataset via independent intensity preprocess, followed by joint resampling and normarlization. Then, we utilize the topology-aware loss to enhance the topology completeness of the CoW and the discrimination between different classes. A complementary topology-aware refinement is further conducted to enhance the connectivity within the same class. Our method was evaluated on all the three tasks and two modalities, achieving competitive results. In the final test phase of TopCow24 Challenge, we achieved the second place in the CTA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the CTA-Box-Task, the first place in the CTA-Edg-Task, the second place in the MRA-Seg-Task, the third palce in the MRA-Box-Task, the second place in the MRA-Edg-Task.</description>

      <title>Multi-centre normative brain mapping of intracranial EEG lifespan patterns in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Understanding healthy human brain function is crucial to identify and map pathological tissue within it. Whilst previous studies have mapped intracranial EEG (icEEG) from non-epileptogenic brain regions, these maps do not consider the effects of age and sex. Further, most existing work on icEEG has often suffered from a small sample size due to the modality's invasive nature. Here, we substantially increase the subject sample size compared to existing literature, to create a multi-centre, normative map of brain activity which additionally considers the effects of age, sex and recording hospital.
  Methods: Using interictal icEEG recordings from n = 502 subjects originating from 15 centres, we constructed a normative map of non-pathological brain activity by regressing age and sex on relative band power in five frequency bands, whilst accounting for the hospital effect.
  Results: Recording hospital significantly impacted normative icEEG maps in all frequency bands, and age was a more influential predictor of band power than sex. The age effect varied by frequency band, but no spatial patterns were observed at the region-specific level. Certainty about regression coefficients was also frequency band specific and moderately impacted by sample size.
  Conclusion: The concept of a normative map is well-established in neuroscience research and particularly relevant to the icEEG modality, which does not allow healthy control baselines. Our key results regarding the hospital site and age effect guide future work utilising normative maps in icEEG.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Optimization of Similarity Scores Between Models and Brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do we know if two systems - biological or artificial - process information in a similar way? Similarity measures such as linear regression, Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Normalized Bures Similarity (NBS), and angular Procrustes distance, are often used to quantify this similarity. However, it is currently unclear what drives high similarity scores and even what constitutes a "good" score. Here, we introduce a novel tool to investigate these questions by differentiating through similarity measures to directly maximize the score. Surprisingly, we find that high similarity scores do not guarantee encoding task-relevant information in a manner consistent with neural data; and this is particularly acute for CKA and even some variations of cross-validated and regularized linear regression. We find no consistent threshold for a good similarity score - it depends on both the measure and the dataset. In addition, synthetic datasets optimized to maximize similarity scores initially learn the highest variance principal component of the target dataset, but some methods like angular Procrustes capture lower variance dimensions much earlier than methods like CKA. To shed light on this, we mathematically derive the sensitivity of CKA, angular Procrustes, and NBS to the variance of principal component dimensions, and explain the emphasis CKA places on high variance components. Finally, by jointly optimizing multiple similarity measures, we characterize their allowable ranges and reveal that some similarity measures are more constraining than others. While current measures offer a seemingly straightforward way to quantify the similarity between neural systems, our work underscores the need for careful interpretation. We hope the tools we developed will be used by practitioners to better understand current and future similarity measures.</description>

      <title>Brain functions emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are shaped by the brain's structural organization. However, the theoretical principles explaining how this physical architecture governs its function remain elusive. Here, we propose an algebraic quantum mechanics (AQM) framework in which the functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of an algebraic quantum system defined on the underlying directed multigraph. These equilibrium states, derived from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states formalism, capture the contribution of each neuron to the overall information flow. We apply this framework to the connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, providing a detailed description of the KMS states, exploring their functional implications, and predicting functional networks based on anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, our approach reveals functional circuits predicted by the topology of the connectome and illuminates on the mechanisms linking structure to function.</description>

      <title>Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interfaces with Electrocorticography (ECoG) have shown promise for high-performance speech decoding in medical applications, but less damaging methods like intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) remain underexplored. With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (i) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the lateral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (ii) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.</description>
