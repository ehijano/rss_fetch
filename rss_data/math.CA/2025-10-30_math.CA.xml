      <title>Symmetry Approach to Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations with Retarded Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review studies on the application of Lie group methods to delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). For first- and second-order DODEs with a single delay parameter that depends on independent and dependent variables, the group classifications are performed. Classes of invariant DODEs for each Lie subgroup are written out. The symmetries allow us to construct invariant solutions to such equations. The application of variational methods to functionals with one delay yields DODEs with two delays. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches are reviewed. The delay analog of the Legendre transformation, which relates the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches, is also analysed. Noether-type operator identities relate the invariance of delay functionals with the appropriate variational equations and their conserved quantities. These identities are used to formulate Noether-type theorems that give first integrals of second-order DODEs with symmetries. Finally, several open problems are formulated in the Conclusion.</description>

      <title>Extension of tetration to real and complex heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.00247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous tetrational function ${^x}r=\tau(r,x)$, the unique solution of equation $\tau(r,x)=r^{\tau(r,x-1)}$ and its differential equation $\tau'(r,x) =q \tau(r,x) \tau'(r,x-1)$, is given explicitly as ${^x}r=\exp_{r}^{\lfloor x \rfloor+1}[\{x\}]_q$, where $x$ is a real variable called height, $r$ is a real constant called base, $\{x\}=x-\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the sawtooth function, $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the floor function of $x$, and $[\{x\}]_q=(q^{\{x\}}-1)/(q-1)$ is a q-analog of $\{x\}$ with $q=\ln r$, respectively. Though ${^x}r$ is continuous at every point in the real $r-x$ plane, extensions to complex heights and bases have limited domains. The base $r$ can be extended to the complex plane if and only if $x\in \mathbb{Z}$. On the other hand, the height $x$ can be extended to the complex plane at $\Re(x)\notin \mathbb{Z}$. Therefore $r$ and $x$ in ${^x}r$ cannot be complex values simultaneously. Tetrational laws are derived based on the explicit formula of ${^x}r$.</description>

      <title>On existence and properties of roots of third Painlev\'e' transcendents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Separate consideration of properties of roots of Third Painlev\'e transcendents (P_III-functions) is necessary due to irregularity the differential equation defining them reveals on the subset of the phase space where its solution would vanish. Application of the Hamiltonian formalism enables one to replace the mentioned second order differential equation (Third Painlev\'e equation) by two independent systems of two nonlinear first order equations whose structures allow to name them coupled Riccati equations. The existence of P_III-functions vanishing at a given non-zero point then follows, all they being analytic thereat. The set $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{C}$ (or $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{R}$) can be used for their indexing. It proves also to be natural to use as an unknown the third order derivative rather than the original nknown itself. After transformation of the corresponding differential equations to equivalent integral equations the efficient algorithm of the constructing of approximate solutions to Third Painlev\'e equation in vicinity of their non-zero root in the form of truncated power series is obtained. An example of its application is given, its numerical validation presenting results in a graphical form is carried out. The associated approximation applicable in vicinity of a pole of the corresponding P_III-function is given as well. The bounds from below for the distances between a pair of roots of a P_III-function and between a root and a pole representable in terms of elementary functions are derived.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for solutions of differential equations having a coalescing turning point and double pole, with an application to Legendre functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of solutions to the second-order linear differential equation $d^{2}w/dz^{2}={u^{2}f(\alpha,z)+g(z)}w$ is analyzed for a large real parameter $u$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$, where $\alpha_{0}&gt;0$ is fixed. The independent variable $z$ ranges over a complex domain $Z$ (possibly unbounded) on which $f(\alpha,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic except at $z=0$, where the differential equation has a regular singular point. For $\alpha&gt;0$, the function $f(\alpha,z)$ has a double pole at $z=0$ and a simple zero in $Z$, and as $\alpha\to 0$ the turning point coalesces with the pole. Bessel-function approximations are constructed for large $u$ involving asymptotic expansions that are uniformly valid for $z\in Z$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$. The expansion coefficients are generated by simple recursions, and explicit error bounds are obtained that simplify earlier results. As an application, uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for associated Legendre functions with large degree $\nu$, valid for complex $z$ in an unbounded domain and for order $\mu\in[0,\nu(1-\delta)]$, where $\delta&gt;0$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>
