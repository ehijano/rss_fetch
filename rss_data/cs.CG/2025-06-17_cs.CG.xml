      <title>Asymmetric Separation Problem for Bichromatic Point Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Generalized Red-Blue Annulus Cover problem for two sets of points, red ($R$) and blue ($B$), where each point $p \in R\cup B$ is associated with a positive penalty ${\cal P}(p)$. The red points have non-covering penalties, and the blue points have covering penalties. The objective is to compute an annulus (either a rectangular or a circular) $\cal A$ such that the value of the function ${\cal P}({R}^{out}) + {\cal P}({ B}^{in})$ is minimum, where ${R}^{out} \subseteq {R}$ is the set of red points not covered by ${\cal A}$, and ${B}^{in} \subseteq {B}$ is the set of blue points covered by $\cal A$. We study the problem for various types of axis-parallel rectangular annulus and circular annulus in one and two dimensions. We also study a restricted version of the rectangular annulus cover problem, where the center of the annulus is constrained to lie on a given horizontal line $L$. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for each type of annulus.</description>

      <title>A Sparse Multicover Bifiltration of Linear Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-cover of a point cloud $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at radius $r$ is the set of all points within distance $r$ of at least $k$ points of $X$. By varying $r$ and $k$ we obtain a two-parameter filtration known as the multicover bifiltration. This bifiltration has received attention recently due to being choice-free and robust to outliers. However, it is hard to compute: the smallest known equivalent simplicial bifiltration has $O(|X|^{d+1})$ simplices. We introduce a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of the multicover bifiltration of linear size $O(|X|)$, for fixed $d$ and $\epsilon$. The methods also apply to the subdivision Rips bifiltration on metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension, yielding analogous results.</description>

      <title>On the Uncrossed Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing a graph $G$ in the plane nicely, for example, without crossings, is unfortunately not always possible. To address this problem, Masa\v{r}\'ik and Hlin\v{e}n\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More formally, a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for each edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is uncrossed. The uncrossed number $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum number of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.
  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik. We also present a strong general lower bound on $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the number of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which is the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that participate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his book [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].</description>
