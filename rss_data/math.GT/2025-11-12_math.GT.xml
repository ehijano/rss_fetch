      <title>Effects of tangle replacement on neighborhood equivalence classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tangle replacement in the context of spatial graphs. The main results show that, for certain spatial handcuff graphs, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the neighborhood equivalence classes of the spatial graphs obtained by tangle replacement and the tangles with which the replacement is performed, up to possibly some permutation. As corollaries, we distinguish handlebody-knots difficult to differentiate with computational invariants and determine their chirality and symmetry groups.</description>

      <title>XC-tangles and universal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08045v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of decorated abstract graphs, that we call XC-tangles, that provides a very convenient framework to study quantum invariants of tangles and virtual tangles. These can be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of rotational tangle diagrams for (virtual) upwards tangles, and constitute the topological analogue of XC-algebras, the minimum algebraic structure needed to construct an knot isotopy invariant following the construction of Lawrence and Lee. XC-tangles admit a very natural description in terms of the so-called XC-Gauss diagrams, and this equivalence lifts the well-known equivalence between virtual upwards tangles and upwards Gauss diagrams. For every XC-algebra $A$, there is a naturally defined strict monoidal full functor $Z_A: \mathcal{T}^{\mathrm{XC}} \rightarrow v\mathcal{E}(A)$ from the category of XC-tangles to the "virtual category of elements of $A$". When $A$ is the endomorphism algebra of a finite-dimensional representation of a ribbon Hopf algebra, this functor can be viewed as an extension of the corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev functor. Lastly, we also initiate the study of a theory of finite type invariants for one-component XC-tangles that lifts that for virtual long knots.</description>

      <title>Quantifying discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact space $X$ that does not admit an embedding (an injective continuous function) into $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the ''degree'' of discontinuity that any injective function $X \to \mathbb{R}^d$ must have. To this end, we define a scale invariant modulus of discontinuity and obtain general lower bounds, thus obtaining quantified nonembeddability results of Haefliger--Weber type. Moreover, we establish analogous lower bounds for simplicial complexes that do not admit an almost $r$-embedding in $\mathbb{R}^d$, thus obtaining a quantified version of the topological Tverberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Khovanov--Rozansky matrix factorization reduction for bipartite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) link polynomial is a certain $t$-deformation of Wilson loops in 3-dimensional $SU(N)$ Chern--Simons topological field theory, believed to be an observable in the refined Chern-Simons theory, probably described in terms of 4d or 5d QFT and related by a certain procedure to the triply-graded link superpolynomial. This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case.</description>

      <title>Algebraic correspondences and Schwarz reflections: Where rational dynamics meets Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of the rapidly evolving field of dynamics of algebraic correspondences, with a focus on matings between rational maps and Kleinian groups. These correspondences exhibit rich dynamics, both within the Sullivan dictionary and beyond. We highlight unifying structures in their parameter spaces, showing how moduli spaces of rational maps and Kleinian groups naturally connect. We also outline a range of applications of the techniques developed in this framework and conclude with several promising directions.</description>

      <title>Powers of half-twists and congruence subgroups of braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the relationship between congruence subgroups $B_n[m]$ and $\mathcal{N}_n(\sigma_1^m)$ the normal closure of $\sigma_1^m$, where $\sigma_1$ is the classical generator of $B_n$. We characterize the conditions under which $\mathcal{N}_n(\sigma_1^m)$ has finite index in $B_n[m]$ and provide explicit generators for these finite quotients. For the cases where the index is infinite, we show that $B_n[m]/\mathcal{N}_n(\sigma_1^m)$ contains a free subgroup. Additionally, we compute the Abelianisation of Coxeter braid subgroups in the finite index cases and construct new finite quotients using commutators of congruence subgroups.</description>

      <title>Cobordism maps in Khovanov homology and singular instanton homology II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our previous work, where we defined an embedded cobordism map on the instanton cube complex that recovers the cobordism maps both in Khovanov homology and singular instanton theory. In this paper, we extend this construction to immersed cobordisms, where we define an immersed cobordism map on Khovanov homology and prove that it is compatible with the immersed cobordism map on singular instanton homology. We give two applications: (i) For any smooth, oriented concordance $C$ from a two-bridge torus knot, the induced map $\mathit{Kh}(C)$ on Khovanov homology is injective, and its left inverse is given by the reversal of $C$. (ii) Any pair of relatively exotic surfaces in $D^4$ that are detected by the embedded cobordism map in $\mathit{Kh}$ remain exotic even after applying any number of positive twist moves.</description>

Abstract: We show that an oriented surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ containing double point singularities induces a map between the Khovanov homology groups of its boundary links in a functorial way. As part of this work, the movie moves of Carter and Saito are extended to surfaces with double points.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\mathcal{N}}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several important general structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds we have seen hints of concrete $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ representations underlying the different $\hat Z$-invariants of the given manifolds. At the same time, these invariants appear to only span a subspace of the representation, and the role of the latter remains mysterious. We elucidate the meaning of the modular group representation, realized as vector-valued quantum modular forms, by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form for $\widetilde {\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants of a given three-manifold, when the newly defined defects $\hat Z$-invariants are included. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for three three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these mock invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>
