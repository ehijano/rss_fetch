      <title>An Oxidation Gradient Straddling the Small Planet Radius Valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a population-level view of volatile gas species (H$_2$, He, H$_2$O, O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$) distribution during the sub-Neptune to rocky planet transition, revealing in detail the dynamic nature of small planet atmospheric compositions. Our novel model couples the atmospheric escape model $\texttt{IsoFATE}$ with the magma ocean-atmosphere equilibrium chemistry model $\texttt{Atmodeller}$ to simulate interior-atmosphere evolution over time for sub-Neptunes around G, K and M stars. Chiefly, our simulations reveal that atmospheric mass fractionation driven by escape and interior-atmosphere exchange conspire to create a distinct oxidation gradient straddling the small-planet radius valley. We discover a key mechanism in shaping the oxidation landscape is the dissolution of water into the molten mantle, which shields oxygen from early escape, buffers the escape rate, and leads to oxidized secondary atmospheres following mantle outgassing. Our simulations reproduce a prominent population of He-rich worlds along the upper edge of the radius valley, revealing that they are stable on shorter timescales than previously predicted. Our simulations also robustly predict a broad population of O$_2$-dominated atmospheres on close-in planets around low mass stars, posing a potential source of false positive biosignature detection and marking a high-priority opportunity for the first-ever atmospheric O$_2$ detection. We motivate future atmospheric characterization surveys by providing a target list of planet candidates predicted to have O$_2$-, He-, and deuterium-rich atmospheres.</description>

      <title>COMetary dust TAIL Simulator (COMTAILS): A computer code to generate comet dust tail brightness images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We present the COMetary dust TAIL Simulator (COMTAILS), a numerical Monte Carlo code to generate images of dust tail brightness from comets and active asteroids in the Solar System. Aims. We describe a numerical code, available to interested users, capable of generating simulated images of dust tail brightness for comparison with observations, to retrieve key dust parameters including size distribution, ejection velocities, and dust loss rates. An optional stellar field can be included in the background allowing for the assessment of stellar extinction by the tail, which can be compared with observational data. Methods. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to obtain the simulated images. The orbital parameters of the targets and their helio-centric positions and velocities were obtained from the JPL Horizons on-line ephemeris system. Results. Earlier versions of this code have been used to characterize the dust environment of various targets. In this study we present recent examples that demonstrate its ability to fit observed images of the long-period comets C/2024 N3 (NEOWISE) and C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). The code is readily applicable to future targets that may be identified for the upcoming European Space Agency Comet Interceptor mission.</description>

      <title>Design of a low-thrust gravity-assisted rendezvous trajectory to Halley's comet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets are the most pristine planetesimals left from the formation of the Solar System. They carry unique information on the materials and the physical processes which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important questions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of cometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley, in 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding scientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the Sun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed light on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde orbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the large relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma of the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such limitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the shortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead times of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary transfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission planning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust rendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity during the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a gravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific payload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change maneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable limits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a Saturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design strategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple proof-of-concept solutions.</description>

      <title>Asteroid phase curves and phase coloring effect using the ATLAS survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determined phase curves for 301,272 asteroids in the orange filter and 280,953 in the cyan filter from the latest ATLAS Solar System Catalog V2 (SSCAT-2). Among them, 3,345 and 492 asteroids in the orange and cyan filters, respectively, have uncertainties below 15%. Our simple model, which considers only the apparition effect, showed good consistency with more sophisticated methods requiring much less computational time. Database cross-matching allowed us to analyze G1 and G2 distributions according to taxonomy. We conducted two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to investigate two distinct aspects: similarities in paired G1, G2 distributions across different taxa and wavelength dependency within the same taxa. When comparing different taxa, we couldn't reject the null hypothesis for 11% of the orange sample and 31% of the cyan sample, indicating more disparities in the orange filter. For wavelength dependency, paired distributions of G1, G2 (o) vs. G1, G2 (c) showed statistically significant differences across all complexes, except for the A class. Our analysis suggests that while phase coloring behaviors are observed without a clear preference for reddening or bluening at phase angles below 5 degrees, reddening predominates in the 10 - 30 degrees range. We also observed smaller uncertainties in G2 than in G1. Simulations showed that G2 is less sensitive to lack of data at small phase angles. This is related to the definition of the H,G1,G2 function, where G1 contributes more to the opposition effect and G2 the linear part of the phase curve. Our catalog-independent algorithms are adaptable to new data sets, including future LSST data.</description>

      <title>Infrared Fluxes and Light Curves of Near-Earth Objects: The full Spitzer Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IRAC camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope observed 2175 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) during its Warm Mission phase, primarily in three large surveys, and also in a small number of a dedicated projects. In this paper we present the final reprocessing of the NEO data and determine fluxes at 3.6 microns (where available) and 4.5 microns. The observing windows range from minutes to nearly ten hours, which means that for 39 NEOs we observe a complete lightcurve, and for these objects we present period and amplitude estimates and derive minimum cohesive strengths for the objects with well-determined periods. For an additional 128 objects we detect a significant fraction of a complete lightcurve, and present estimated lower limits to their rotation periods. This paper presents the final and definitive Spitzer/IRAC NEO flux catalog.</description>

      <title>CARMENES as an Instrument for Exoplanet Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CARMENES stands for Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical \'Echelle Spectrographs. CARMENES took six years from a concept to the start of operations, and a couple more years of initial data collection until the first science publication, but now is revolutionising our knowledge on exoplanets and their stars in our immediate vicinity. Here we describe what CARMENES is: (i) an ultra-stabilised two-channel spectrograph at an almost dedicated 3.5 m telescope in southern Spain that covers in high spectral resolution and without big gaps from 0.52 mum to 1.71 mum; (ii) a science project aimed at comprehensively searching for and studying planetary systems with nearby, bright, M-dwarf hosts, but that also investigates transiting planets around other stars; and (iii) the German-Spanish consortium that designed and built the instrument and that has operated it under guaranteed and legacy time observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Scattered Light properties of LTT 9779 b Using HST/WFC3 UVIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planet's albedo is a fundamental property that sets its energy budget by dictating the fraction of incident radiation absorbed versus reflected back to space. Generally, optical eclipse observations have revealed the majority of hot, giant planets to have low albedos, indicating dayside atmospheres dominated by absorption instead of reflection. However, there are several exceptions to this rule, including the ultra-hot-Neptune LTT 9779b, which have been found to have high geometric albedos. We observed four eclipses of LTT 9779b with the G280 grism of the Hubble Space Telescope's WFC3 UVIS mode; targeting the scattering signatures of the cloud condensate species causing the planet's elevated reflectivity. However, we do not definitively detect the planet's eclipse in our observations, with injection-recovery tests yielding a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 113 ppm on the eclipse depth of LTT 9779b in the 0.2-0.8$\mu$m waveband. We create reflectance spectrum grids for LTT 9779b's dayside using VIRGA/PICASO and compare to our UVIS limit, as well as previously published CHEOPS and TESS eclipse photometry. We find that silicate condensates are best able to explain LTT 9779b's highly-reflective dayside. Our forward model grids only enable weak constraints on vertical mixing efficiency, and suggest that, regardless of their particular composition, the clouds are likely composed of smaller and more reflective particles. Our work facilitates a deeper understanding of the reflectance properties of LTT 9779b as well as the UVIS spectroscopic mode itself, which will remain the community's primary access to UV wavelengths until next-generation telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal Impact Vapor Plumes and Nebular Shocks form Chondritic Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of chondrules, and the chondritic sedimentary rocks that dominate the meteoritic record, is a long-standing problem in planetary science. Here, we develop a physical model for the formation of chondritic mixtures as an outcome of vaporizing collisions between planetesimals that were dynamically excited by the growth and migration of planets. We present calculations of nebular shock waves generated by impact vapor plumes and focus on aspects of the plume interaction with the nebular gas and dust that have been neglected in previous studies of impact ejecta. We find that, when water dominates the vapor, the plumes are relatively cool. However, the plume expansion is supersonic and can drive strong shock waves in the dusty nebular gas. Portions of these nebular shock fronts initially melt nebular dust, forming chondrules that are coupled to the moving front. As the shock front expands and cools, the chondrules solidify while the shock front entrains additional dust. Eventually, the plume expansion stalls and then hydrodynamically collapses, turbulently mixing variably processed dust and size-sorted chondrules. For probable impact parameters and nebular conditions during giant planet growth and migration, the impact-generated mixtures have characteristics that span the range observed in chondritic meteorites, providing an environment for rapid formation of chondritic assemblages after chondrule formation. Our impact vapor and nebular shocks (IVANS) model links chondrule formation to the overall context of planet formation and provides a framework for interpreting the detailed chronological and geochemical record contained in chondritic meteorites.</description>

      <title>The discovery and characterization of Earth-crossing asteroid 2024 YR$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe observations and physical characteristics of Earth-crossing asteroid 2024 YR$_4$, discovered on 2024 December 27 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The asteroid has semi-major axis, $a$ = 2.52 au, eccentricity, $e$ = 0.66, inclination $i$ = 3.41$^{\circ}$, and a $\sim$0.003 au Earth minimum orbit intersection distance. We obtained g, r, i, and Z imaging with the Gemini South/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on 2025 February 7. We measured a g-i spectral slope of 13$\pm$3 $\%$/100 nm, and color indices g-r = 0.70$\pm$0.10, r-i = 0.25$\pm$0.06, i-Z = -0.27$\pm$0.10. 2024 YR$_4$ has a spectrum that best matches R-type and Sa-type asteroids and a diameter of $\sim$30-65 m using our measured absolute magnitude of 23.9$\pm$0.3, and assuming an albedo of 0.15-0.4. The lightcurve of 2024 YR$_4$ shows $\sim$0.4 mag variations with a rotation period of $\sim$1170 s. We use photometry of 2024 YR$_4$ from Gemini and other sources taken between 2024 December to 2025 February to determine the asteroid's spin vector and shape, finding that it has an oblate, $\sim$3:1 a:c axial ratio and a pole direction of $\lambda$, $\beta$ = $\sim$42$^{\circ}$, $\sim$-25$^{\circ}$. Finally, we compare the orbital elements of 2024 YR$_4$ with the NEO population model and find that its most likely sources are resonances between the inner and central Main Belt.</description>

      <title>An Oasis in the Brown Dwarf Desert: Confirmation of Two Low-mass Transiting Brown Dwarfs Discovered by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the intermediate-mass siblings of stars and planets, brown dwarfs (BDs) are vital to study for a better understanding of how objects change across the planet-to-star mass range. Here, we report two low-mass transiting BD systems discovered by TESS, TOI-4776 (TIC 196286578) and TOI-5422 (TIC 80611440), located in an under-populated region of the BD mass-period space. These two systems have comparable masses but different ages. The younger and larger BD is TOI-4776b with $32.0^{+1.9}_{-1.8}M_{Jup}$ and $1.018^{+0.048}_{-0.043}R_{Jup}$, orbiting a late-F star about $5.4^{+2.8}_{-2.2}$ Gyr old in a 10.4138$\pm$0.000014 day period. The older TOI-5422b has $27.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}M_{Jup}$ and $0.815^{+0.031}_{-0.026}R_{Jup}$ in a 5.3772$\pm$0.00001 day orbit around a subgiant star about $8.2\pm2.4$ Gyr old. Compared with substellar mass-radius (M-R) evolution models, TOI-4776b has an inflated radii. In contrast, TOI-5422b is slightly "underluminous" with respect to model predictions, which is not commonly seen in the BD population. In addition, TOI-5422 shows apparent photometric modulations with a rotation period of 10.75$\pm$0.54 day found by rotation analysis, and the stellar inclination angle is obtained to be $I_{\star}=75.52^{+9.96}_{-11.79}$$^{\circ}$. Therefore, it is likely that TOI-5422b is spinning up the host star and its orbit is aligned with the stellar spin axis.</description>

      <title>Earth's infrared background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like Johnson noise, where thermal fluctuations of charge carriers in a resistor lead to measurable current fluctuations, the internal variability of Earth's atmosphere leads to fluctuations in the infrared radiation emitted to space, creating "Earth's infrared background" (EIB). This background consists of fluctuations that are isotropic in space and red in time, with an upper bound of 400 km and 2.5 days on their spatiotemporal decorrelation, between meso-scale and synoptic-scale weather. Like the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which represent features of interest in the Universe, the anisotropies in Earth's infrared radiation represent features of interest in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the CMB, which represents a historical record of the Universe since the Big Bang, the EIB represents Earth's climate in steady state.</description>

      <title>Characterising planetary material accreted by cool helium atmosphere white dwarfs using an exponentially decaying disc model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) observations and model atmosphere analysis for two nearby, cool, helium-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that have been polluted by accretion: WD J1927-0355 and WD J2141-3300. Detected elements common to both white dwarfs are Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni, with additional detections of Na, Al, Si and Sr in WD J2141-3300. We present an approach for inferring the composition of the accreted material, by adopting a physically motivated model in which the mass accretion rate decays exponentially with time, which provides constraints on the time since the start of the accretion event. The accretion events were most likely to have began at least 1 Myr ago, however the characteristic disc lifetime could not be constrained due to degeneracies. Both white dwarfs were found to have accreted bulk planetary material with compositions similar to that of both bulk Earth and chondritic meteorites. The parent bodies causing pollution in both cases were inferred to be the mass of a small moon or dwarf planet.</description>

Abstract: Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur whenever there exists a relative velocity between gas and dust. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, for which a strong interaction can be found between drifting dust and a travelling gas wave, leading to fast-growing perturbations (growth rates $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$) even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$. They are called resonant drag instabilities. We focus on the acoustic resonant drag instability, which is potentially important in AGB star outflows, around supernova remnants and star clusters in starburst galaxies. We study the acoustic resonant drag instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether it survives in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid for the acoustic drag instability, focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the fast-growing perturbations $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ of the monodisperse limit into slower growing perturbations $\propto \mu$ due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. Furthermore, the large wave numbers that grow fastest in the monodisperse regime are stabilized by a size distribution, severely limiting the growth rates in the polydisperse regime. The acoustic resonant drag instability turns from a singularly perturbed problem in $\mu$ in the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation for a sufficiently wide size distribution. It can still grow exponentially in the polydisperse regime, but at a slower pace compared to the single size case.</description>

      <title>The Chemical Composition of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a brief introduction to the chemical composition of the Sun. The focus of the chapter is on results obtained from the physical analysis of the solar photosphere. Data obtained from meteorites, solar wind and corona measurements, as well as helioseismology, and solar neutrinos are briefly reviewed. The elemental and isotopic composition of the solar system is derived by combining the solar and meteoritic data. The cosmochemical and astronomical abundance scales are described. The results of the determinations of the protosolar chemical composition, as well as the initial and present-day mass fractions of hydrogen, helium, and metals (X, Y, Z) for the solar system are presented in extensive tables. All tables are also available in machine-readable form via Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14988840</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm</title>

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>
