      <title>Authorship-contribution normalized Sh-index and citations are better research output indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bibliometric measures, such as total citations and h-index, have become a cornerstone for evaluating academic performance; however, these traditional metrics, being non-weighted, inadequately capture the nuances of individual contributions. To address this constraint, we developed GScholarLens, an open-access browser extension that integrates seamlessly with Google Scholar to enable detailed bibliometric analysis. GScholarLens categorizes publications by authorship roles, adjusts citation weightings accordingly, and introduces Scholar h-index, Sh-index, an authorship-contribution normalized h-index. This tool proportionally weights citations based on authorship position using heuristic percentages, i.e., corresponding 100 percent, first 90 percent, second 50 percent, co-authors in publications with less than six authors 25 percent, and co-authors with more than six authors 10 percent. Currently, there is no empirical data available for author-contribution weights, however, this proof-of-concept framework can easily adapt more precise author-contribution weightage data decided by authors at the time of manuscript submission along with CRediT, which journals and publishers can mandate. Furthermore, this tool incorporates retraction detection by mapping data from retraction databases into the Google Scholar interface. By aligning bibliometric evaluation more closely with actual scholarly contribution, GScholarLens presents a better open-access framework for academic recognition, particularly within interdisciplinary and highly collaborative research environments. This tool is freely accessible at https://project.iith.ac.in/sharmaglab/gscholarlens/.</description>

      <title>The changing role of cited papers over time: An analysis of highly cited papers based on a large full-text dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines how the role of cited papers evolves over time by analyzing nearly 900 highly cited papers (HCPs) published between 2000 and 2016 and the full text of over 220,000 papers citing them. We investigate multiple citation characteristics, including citation location within the full text, reference and in-text citation types, citation sentiment, and textual and bibliographic relatedness between citing and cited papers. Our findings reveal that as HCPs age, they tend to be cited earlier in papers citing them, mentioned fewer times in the full text, and more often cited alongside other references. Citation sentiment remains predominantly neutral, while both textual and bibliographic similarity between HCPs and their citing papers decline over time. These patterns indicate a shift from direct topical and methodological engagement toward more general, background, and symbolic referencing. The findings highlight the importance to consider citation context rather than relying solely on simple citation counts. Large-scale full-text analyses such as ours can help refine measures of scientific impact and advance scholarly search and science mapping by uncovering more nuanced connections between papers.</description>

      <title>Is Artificial Intelligence Reshaping the Landscape of the International Academic Community of Geosciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through bibliometric analysis and topic modeling, we find that artificial intelligence (AI) is positively transforming geosciences research, with a notable increase in AI-related scientific output in recent years. We are encouraged to observe that earth scientists from developing countries have gained better visibility in the recent AI for Science (AI4S) paradigm and that AI is also improving the landscape of international collaboration in geoscience-related research.</description>
