      <title>Isotropic constants and platonic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss first-order optimality conditions for the isotropic constant and combine them with RS-movements to obtain structural information about polytopal maximizers. Strengthening a result by Rademacher, it is shown that a polytopal local maximizer with a simplicial vertex must be a simplex. A similar statement is shown for a centrally symmetric local maximizer with a simplicial vertex: it has to be a cross-polytope. Moreover, we show that a zonotope that maximizes the isotropic constant and that has a cubical zone must be a cube. Finally, we consider the class of zonotopes with at most n+1 generators and determine the extremals in this class.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances between normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the original Gromov-Hausdorff distance between real normed spaces. In the first part of the paper we prove that two finite-dimensional real normed spaces on a finite Gromov-Hausdorff distance are isometric to each other. We then study the properties of finite point sets in finite-dimensional normed spaces whose cardinalities exceed the equilateral dimension of an ambient space. By means of the obtained results we prove the following enhancement of the aforementioned theorem: every finite-dimensional normed space lies on an infinite Gromov-Hausdorff distance from all other non-isometric normed spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantitative tightness for three-dimensional contact manifolds: a sub-Riemannian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the use of sub-Riemannian metrics we provide quantitative estimates for the maximal tight neighbourhood of a Reeb orbit on a three-dimensional contact manifold. Under appropriate geometric conditions we show how to construct closed curves which are boundaries of overtwisted disks. We introduce the concept of contact Jacobi curve, and prove sharp lower bounds of the so-called tightness radius (from a Reeb orbit) in terms of Schwarzian derivative bounds. We also prove similar, but non-sharp, comparison theorems in terms of sub-Riemannian canonical curvature bounds. We apply our results to K-contact sub-Riemannian manifolds. In this setting, we prove a contact analogue of the celebrated Cartan-Hadamard theorem.</description>

      <title>Bundle type sub-Riemannian structures on holonomy bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, combining the Rashevsky-Chow-Sussmann (orbit) theorem with the Ambrose-Singer theorem, we introduce the notion of controllable principal connections on principal $G$-bundles. Using this concept, under a mild assumption of compactness, we estimate the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between principal $G$-bundles and certain reductive homogeneous $G$-spaces. In addition, we prove that every reduction of the structure group $G$ to a closed connected subgroup gives rise to a sequence of Riemannian metrics on the total space for which the underlying sequence of metric spaces converges, in the Gromov-Housdorff topology, to a normal reductive homogeneous $G$-space. This last finding allows one to detect the presence of certain reductive homogeneous $G$-spaces in the Gromov-Housdorff closure of the moduli space of Riemannian metrics of the total space of the bundle through topological invariants provided by obstruction theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved that the mapping class group of any closed surface with finitely many marked points is quasiisometric to a CAT(0) cube complex. We provide two distinct proofs, one tailored to mapping class groups, and one applying to a larger class of groups.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic models for CAT(0) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two new tools for studying CAT(0) spaces: \emph{curtains}, versions of cubical hyperplanes; and the \emph{curtain model}, a counterpart of the curve graph. These tools shed new light on CAT(0) spaces, allowing us to prove a dichotomy of a rank-rigidity flavour, establish Ivanov-style rigidity theorems for isometries of the curtain model, find isometry-invariant copies of its Gromov boundary in the visual boundary of the underlying CAT(0) space, and characterise rank-one isometries both in terms of their action on the curtain model and in terms of curtains. Finally, we show that the curtain model is universal for WPD actions over all groups acting properly on the CAT(0) space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a packing dimension estimate on the exceptional sets of orthogonal projections of sets satisfying an almost dimension conservation law. In particular, the main result applies to homogeneous sets and to certain graph-directed sets. Connections are drawn to results of M. Rams and T. Orponen.</description>

      <title>The extremals of the Kahn-Saks inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical result of Kahn and Saks states that given any partially ordered set with two distinguished elements, the number of linear extensions in which the ranks of the distinguished elements differ by $k$ is log-concave as a function of $k$. The log-concave sequences that can arise in this manner prove to exhibit a much richer structure, however, than is evident from log-concavity alone. The main result of this paper is a complete characterization of the extremals of the Kahn-Saks inequality: we obtain a detailed combinatorial understanding of where and what kind of geometric progressions can appear in these log-concave sequences. This settles a partial conjecture of Chan-Pak-Panova, while the analysis uncovers new extremals that were not previously conjectured. The proof relies on a much more general geometric mechanism -- a hard Lefschetz theorem for nef classes that was obtained in the setting of convex polytopes by Shenfeld and Van Handel -- which forms a model for the investigation of such structures in other combinatorial problems.</description>
