      <title>Parallel implementation of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method achieving a quarter petaFLOPS performance on a single DGX-H100 GPU node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report cutting edge performance results for a hybrid CPU-multi GPU implementation of the spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method on current state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX-H100 architectures. We evaluate the performance of the DMRG electronic structure calculations for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively. We achieve 246 teraFLOPS of sustained performance, an improvement of more than 2.5x compared to the performance achieved on the DGX-A100 architectures and an 80x acceleration compared to an OpenMP parallelized implementation on a 128-core CPU architecture. Our work highlights the ability of tensor network algorithms to efficiently utilize high-performance GPU hardware and shows that the combination of tensor networks with modern large-scale GPU accelerators can pave the way towards solving some of the most challenging problems in quantum chemistry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frequency-Dependent Optical Spectrum for Solid Materials: A Multi-Output &amp; Multi-Fidelity Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency-dependent optical spectrum is pivotal for a broad range of applications, from material characterization to optoelectronics and energy harvesting. Data-driven surrogate models, trained on density functional theory (DFT) data, have effectively alleviated the scalability limitations of DFT while preserving its chemical accuracy, expediting material discovery. However, prevailing machine learning (ML) efforts often focus on scalar properties such as the band gap, overlooking the complexities of optical spectra. In this work, we employ deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the frequency-dependent complex-valued dielectric function across the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra directly from crystal structures. We explore multiple architectures for multi-output spectral representation of the dielectric function and utilize various multi-fidelity learning strategies, such as transfer learning and fidelity embedding, to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of high-fidelity DFT data. Additionally, we model key solar cell absorption efficiency metrics, demonstrating that learning these parameters is enhanced when integrated through a learning bias within the learning of the frequency-dependent absorption coefficient. This study demonstrates that leveraging multi-output and multi-fidelity ML techniques enables accurate predictions of optical spectra from crystal structures, providing a versatile tool for rapidly screening materials for optoelectronics, optical sensing, and solar energy applications across an extensive frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Using Activity to Compartmentalize Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally study suspensions of slow and fast active Brownian particles that have undergone motility induced phase separation and are at steady state. Such mixtures, of varying non-zero activity, remain largely unexplored even though they are relevant for a plethora of systems and applications ranging from cellular biophysics to drone swarms. Our mixtures are modulated by their activity ratios ($\mathrm{Pe}^\mathrm{R}$), which we find to encode information by giving rise to three regimes, each of which display their unique emergent behaviors. Specifically, we found non-monotonic behavior of macroscopic properties, e.g. density and pressure, as a function of activity ratio, microphase separation of fast and slow particle domains, increased fluctuations on the interface and severe avalanche events compared to monodisperse active systems. Our approach of simultaneously varying the two activities of the particle species allowed us to discover these behaviors and explain the microscopic physical mechanisms that drive them.</description>

      <title>Edge Formation Mechanism of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations based on a Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the high potential for applications utilizing the unique properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), the applications remain challenging due to the difficulty of synthesizing SWCNTs with a specific chirality. To elucidate the mechanisms that determine their chirality during growth, intensive efforts have been devoted to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the mechanism of chirality determination has not been fully clarified, which can partly be attributed to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials in reproducing the behavior of carbon and metal atoms. In this work, we develop a neural network potential (NNP) for carbon-metal system to accurately describe the SWCNT growth, and perform MD simulations of SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD simulations demonstrate the process of defect-free chirality-definable SWCNT growth with dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations, and the consistency between the probability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability predicted from the nanotube-catalyst interfacial energy. It is also shown that the edge defect formation is induced by vacancy and suppressed by vacancy healing through adatom diffusion on the SWCNT edges. These results provide insights into the edge formation thermodynamics and kinetics of SWCNTs, an important clue to the chirality-controlled synthesis of SWCNTs.</description>

      <title>XFLUIDS: A SYCL-based unified cross-architecture heterogeneous simulation solver for compressible reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cross-architecture high-order heterogeneous Navier-Stokes simulation solver, XFluids, for compressible reacting multicomponent flows on different platforms. The multi-component reacting flows are ubiquitous in many scientific and engineering applications, while their numerical simulations are usually time-consuming to capture the underlying multiscale features. Although heterogeneous accelerated computing is significantly beneficial for large-scale simulations of these flows, effective utilization of various heterogeneous accelerators with different architectures and programming models in the market remains a challenge. To address this, we develop XFluids by SYCL, to perform acceleration directly targeted to different devices, without translating any source code. A variety of optimization techniques have been proposed to increase the computational performance of XFluids, including adaptive range assignment, partial eigensystem reconstruction, hotspot device function optimizations, etc. This solver has been open-sourced, and tested on multiple GPUs from different mainstream vendors, indicating high portability. Through various benchmark cases, the accuracy of XFluids is demonstrated, with approximately no efficiency loss compared to existing GPU programming models, such as CUDA and HIP. In addition, the MPI library is used to extend the solver to multi-GPU platforms, with the GPU-enabled MPI supported. With this, the weak scaling of XFluids for multi-GPU devices is larger than 95% for 1024 GPUs. Finally, we simulate both the inert and reactive multicomponent shock-bubble interaction problems with high-resolution meshes, to investigate the reacting effects on the mixing, vortex stretching, and shape deformation of the bubble evolution.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <title>Iterative methods of linearized moment equations for rarefied gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the iterative methods for large moment systems derived from the linearized Boltzmann equation. By Fourier analysis, it is shown that the direct application of the block symmetric Gauss-Seidel (BSGS) method has slower convergence for smaller Knudsen numbers. Better convergence rates for dense flows are then achieved by coupling the BSGS method with the micro-macro decomposition, which treats the moment equations as a coupled system with a microscopic part and a macroscopic part. Since the macroscopic part contains only a small number of equations, it can be solved accurately during the iteration with a relatively small computational cost, which accelerates the overall iteration. The method is further generalized to the multiscale decomposition which splits the moment system into many subsystems with different orders of magnitude. Both one- and two-dimensional numerical tests are carried out to examine the performances of these methods. Possible issues regarding the efficiency and convergence are discussed in the conclusion.</description>
