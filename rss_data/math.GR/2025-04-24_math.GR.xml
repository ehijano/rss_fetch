      <description>arXiv:2504.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: You can invent striking and challenging problems with unique solution by building some symmetry into functional equations. Some are suitable for high school; others could generate college-level projects involving computer algebra. The problems are functional equations with group actions in the background. Interesting examples arise even from small finite groups. Whether a given problem ``works" with a given choice of constant coefficients depends on whether a related multilinear form is nonzero. These forms are essentially the classical group determinants studied by Frobenius in the nineteenth century.</description>

      <title>Inducing spectral gaps for the cohomological Laplacians of $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spectral gap of the first cohomological Laplacian $\Delta_1$ for $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ follows once a slightly stronger assumption holds for some $\operatorname{Sp}_{2m}(\mathbb{Z})$, where $n\geq m$. As an application of this result, we provide explicit lower bounds for some quotients of $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ for any $n\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Tracking the symmetries of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s within the Mathieu groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3, we provide a counterpart to the extensive studies by Nikulin and others of the geometry and symmetries of classical Kummer surfaces. In particular, we determine the group of holomorphic symplectic automorphisms of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold limits of K3. We moreover track this group within two of the Mathieu groups, which involves a variation of Kondo's lattice techniques that Taormina and Wendland introduced earlier in their study of the symmetries of Kummer surfaces and the genesis of their symmetry surfing programme. Specifically, we realise the finite group of symplectic automorphisms of this class of K3 surfaces as a subgroup of the sporadic groups Mathieu 12 and Mathieu 24 in terms of permutations of 12, resp. 24 elements. As a proof of concept, we construct an embedding that yields the largest Mathieu group when the symmetry group of $\mathbb Z_3$-orbifold K3s is combined with all symmetries of Kummer surfaces.</description>

      <title>Every non-trivial knot group is fully residually perfect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a class $\mathcal{P}$ of groups we say that a group $G$ is fully residually $\mathcal{P}$ if for any finite subset $F$ of $G$, there exists an epimorphism from $G$ to a group in $\mathcal{P}$ which is injective on $F$. It is known that any non-trivial knot group is fully residually finite. For hyperbolic knots, its knot group is fully residually closed hyperbolic $3$--manifold group, and fully residually simple. In this article, we show that every non-trivial knot group is fully residually perfect, closed $3$--manifold group.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of incomparable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K be a set of infinite cardinals such that the cardinality of K is a beth with countable ordinal index. We construct a family F of pairwise non-embeddable groups such that F contains 2^k groups of order k for every cardinal number k in K. (In particular, in the family F small groups are never embeddable in large groups.) Consequently, for every infinite cardinal number k there exist 2^k pairwise non-embeddable groups of order k. (The existence of such groups is well-known for regular k since 1976.)</description>

      <title>Inducing spectral gaps for the cohomological Laplacians of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\operatorname{SAut}(F_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The technique of inducing spectral gaps for cohomological Laplacians in degree zero was used by Kaluba, Kielak and Nowak to prove property (T) for $\operatorname{SAut}(F_n)$ and $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$. In this paper, we adapt this technique to Laplacians in degree one. This allows to provide a lower bound for the cohomological Laplacian in degree one for $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ for every unitary representation. In particular, one gets in that way an alternative proof of property (T) for $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ whenever $n\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda &gt; 1$. While $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations of groups with $\lambda = 1$ have been studied in numerous papers, this is the first detailed treatment for $\lambda &gt; 1$. We establish fundamental properties of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and introduce the notion of equivalence. We prove various necessary conditions of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, including upper bounds on $\lambda$. We present three constructions of infinite families of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations, highlighting the characterization of two subfamilies of $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations. We discuss a computational approach to $\lambda$-fold near-factorizations and tabulate computational results for abelian groups of small order.</description>

      <title>On the irreducible character degrees of symmetric groups and their multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider problems concerning the largest degrees of irreducible characters of symmetric groups, and the multiplicities of character degrees of symmetric groups. Using evidence from computer experiments, we posit several new conjectures or extensions of previous conjectures, and prove a number of results. One of these is that, if $n\geq 21$, then there are at least eight irreducible characters of $S_n$, all of which have the same degree, and which have irreducible restriction to $A_n$. We explore similar questions about unipotent degrees of $\mathrm{GL}_n(q)$. We also make some remarks about how the experiments here shed light on posited algorithms for finding the largest irreducible character degree of $S_n$.</description>

      <title>$\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An uncountable $\aleph_1$-free group can not admit a Polish group topology but an uncountable $\aleph_1$-free abelian group can, as witnessed e.g. by the Baer-Specker group $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$, in fact, more strongly, $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$ is separable. In this paper we investigate $\aleph_1$-free abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups. We prove two main results. The first is that there are continuum many separable (and so torsionless, and so $\aleph_1$-free) abelian non-Archimedean Polish groups which are not topologically isomorphic to product groups and are pairwise not continuous homomorphic images of each other. The second is that the following four properties are complete co-analytic subsets of the space of closed abelian subgroups of $S_\infty$: separability, torsionlessness, $\aleph_1$-freeness and $\mathbb{Z}$-homogeneity.</description>

      <title>The geometry of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a semisimplicity result for the boundary, in the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactification, of a totally geodesic subvariety of a moduli space of Riemann surfaces. At the level of Teichm\"uller space, this semisimplicity theorem gives that each component of the boundary is a product of simple factors, each of which behaves metrically like a diagonal embedding. Building on this result, we also show that the associated totally geodesic submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space and orbifold fundamental groups are hierarchically hyperbolic.
  The proof intertwines in a novel way results and perspectives originating in dynamics, algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and both classical and modern Teichm\"uller theory. It establishes both new rigidity and new flexibility for totally geodesic submanifolds and their associated varieties and orbifold fundamental groups and provides a rich set of new tools for the study of these objects.</description>
