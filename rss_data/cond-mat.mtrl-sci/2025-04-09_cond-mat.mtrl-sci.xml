      <title>Elastic anisotropy and Surface Acoustic Wave propagation in CoFeB/Au multilayers: influence of thickness and light penetration depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves in multilayered nanostructures represent a critical frontier in understanding material behavior at the nanoscale, with profound implications for emerging acoustic and spintronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the influence of the magnetic layer thickness on the propagation of surface acoustic waves in CoFeB based multilayers. Two approaches to effective medium modelling are considered: one treating the entire multilayer as a homogeneous medium and another focusing on the region affected by light penetration. The elastic properties of the system are analyzed using Brillouin light scattering and numerical modelling, with a particular emphasis on the anisotropy of Young s modulus and its dependence on CoFeB thickness. The results reveal a significant variation in surface acoustic wave velocity and elastic anisotropy as a function of the multilayer configuration, highlighting the role of the penetration depth in effective medium approximations. These findings provide valuable insights into the tunability of acoustic and spin-wave frequencies through structural modifications, which is crucial for the development of high-performance resonators, surface acoustic wave filters, and spin-wave-based information processing devices.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of TiS$_3$ as a novel thin film for single-junction and tandem solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-micrometer thin films are promising platforms for emerging flexible photovoltaic devices. Although the current market already produces efficient solar cells, the average wafer thickness of these devices remains far from the sub-micrometer scale, making them susceptible to cracking under bending stress and thus precluding their use in flexible device applications. Due to its earth abundance, non-toxicity, and low elastic modulus, titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) has emerged as a promising alternative for flexible device applications. Here, using excited-state density functional calculations combined with the transfer matrix approach, we perform an optical analysis and assess the efficiency of a prototype photovoltaic device based on sub-micrometer TiS$_3$ thin films. Using optical constants obtained from our first-principles calculations, we evaluate the photovoltaic response of a single-junction device in the radiative limit, finding that a 140-nm-thick active layer achieves a maximum power conversion efficiency of approximately 22%. Additionally, we investigate tandem solar cells that incorporate TiS$_3$ into perovskite thin films, and find that the lower and upper power conversion efficiencies range from approximately 18% to 33%. Overall, our results suggest great potential for using TiS$_3$ thin films as an active layer in the design of highly efficient flexible solar cells.</description>

      <title>Polaron-induced modifications in the linear and nonlinear optical properties of graphene under electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are the primary charge carriers in organic materials. A deep understanding of their properties can open channels for novel optoelectronic applications. By applying electric and magnetic fields, we investigate the influence of polaron interactions on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a graphene monolayer between a substrate and air. Using the density matrix approach, we derive the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients and the relative refractive index by incorporating the zero-energy level. Our numerical results reveal that the polaron effect and the magnetic field induce shifts in the peak positions of the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index. Moreover, while the presence of electric and magnetic fields significantly alters the amplitude of the absorption coefficients, only the magnetic field affects the refractive index amplitude. Additionally, we find that the magnetic field amplifies the influence of surface optical phonons on the optical properties of graphene. These findings provide deeper insights into the optical behavior of graphene in external fields, which could be relevant for optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Advances in quantum defect embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum defect embedding theory (QDET) is a many-body embedding method designed to describe condensed systems with strongly correlated electrons localized within a given region of space, for example spin defects in semiconductors and insulators. Although the QDET approach has been successful in predicting the electronic properties of several point defects, several limitations of the method remain. In this work, we propose multiple advances to the QDET formalism. We derive a double-counting correction that consistently treats the frequency dependence of the screened Coulomb interaction, and we illustrate the effect of including unoccupied orbitals in the active space. In addition, we propose a method to describe hybridization effects between the active space and the environment, and we compare the results of several impurity solvers, providing further insights into improving the reliability and applicability of the method. We present results for defects in diamond and for molecular qubits, including a detailed comparison with experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the dynamics of a conducting domain wall under applied dc and ac voltages. These dynamics are modeled for a thin film that hosts an ideal charged domain wall via a combination of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the polarization, the Schr\"odinger equation for the electron gas, and Poisson's equation for the electrostatic potential. The electron dynamics are treated within a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the electron gas introduces an additional degree of freedom, beyond polarization relaxation, that modifies the dynamical response of the domain wall. While marginally relevant for the dc response, the electron dynamics have a pronounced effect on the film's ac dielectric function. The dielectric function has an intrinsic contribution, due to the bulk susceptibility of the film, and an extrinsic contribution due to the domain-wall displacement. The elecron gas affects the dielectric function by changing both the amplitude and phase of the displacement.</description>

      <title>Weyl Phonons: The connection of topology and chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and chirality of fermionic quasiparticles have enabled exciting discoveries, including quantum anomalous Hall liquids and topological superconductivity. Recently, topological and chiral phonons emerge as new and fast-evolving research directions. While these concepts are separately developed, they are intimately connected in the context of Weyl phonons. The couplings between chiral and topological phonons with various electronic and magnetic quasiparticles are predicted to give rise to new quantum states and giant magnetism with fundamental and applicational interests, ranging from quantum information science to dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Giant Rashba splitting in PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving a large spin splitting is highly desirable for spintronic devices, which often requires breaking of the inversion symmetry. However, many atomically thin films are centrosymmetric, making them unsuitable for spintronic applications. Here, we report a strategy to achieve inversion symmetry breaking from a centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer PtTe$_2$, leading to a giant Rashba spin splitting. Specifically, the thermal annealing turns one layer of PtTe$_2$ sample into a transition metal monochalcogenide (TMMC) PtTe through Te extraction, thus forming PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure with inversion symmetry breaking. In the naturally-formed PtTe/PtTe$_2$ heterostructure, we observe a giant Rashba spin splitting with Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_{R}$ = 1.8 eV$\cdot$$\AA$, as revealed by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Our work demonstrates a convenient and effective pathway for achieving pronounced Rashba splitting in centrosymmetric TMDC thin films by creating TMMC/TMDC heterostructure, thereby extending their potential applications to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Resistivity measurement for non-magnetic materials using high-order resonance mode of mfm-cantilever oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method to measure the electrical resistivity of materials using magnetic-force microscopy (MFM) is discussed, where MFM detects the magnetic field caused by the tip-oscillation-induced eddy current. To achieve high sensitivity, a high cantilever oscillation frequency is preferable, because it induces large eddy currents in the material. Higher-order resonance modes of the cantilever oscillation leads to higher frequency. To discuss such high-order-mode oscillation, a differential equation governing MFM cantilever oscillation in the high-order resonance mode is formulated, and an analytical solution of the phase difference is obtained. The result shows that the phase difference decreases at higher modes, because the effective spring constant increases faster than the force from the eddy current.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies of ionic motion through solid electrolytes commonly involve static nudged-elastic band (NEB) methods or costly \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD). Building on a time-local model of current carrier-electrolyte interaction and incorporating thermal motion, we introduce an approach that is intermediate between the two well-established methodologies by treating the electrolyte as an effective medium that interacts with the mobile particle. Through this coupling, the thermally vibrating electrolyte imparts energy to the charge carriers while also absorbing energy from them due to its own finite elasticity. Using a simple model system, we validate our approach through a series of numerical simulations. Our methodology reproduces both dissipative and diffusive behavior, and helps link microscopic system parameters to measurable macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Defects in Silicon Carbide as Quantum Qubits: Recent Advances in Defect Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with potential applications as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, outlining the essential criteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then shifts to the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi) and divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge in utilizing these defects for quantum applications is their precise and controllable creation. Various fabrication techniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser processing, and focused ion beam methods, have been explored to create these defects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, this review aims to support early-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related quantum qubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable insights into fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Light-field dressing of transient photo-excited states above $E_F$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-periodic light-field provides an emerging pathway for dynamically engineering quantum materials by forming hybrid states between photons and Bloch electrons. So far, experimental progress on light-field dressed states has been mainly focused on the occupied states, however, it is unclear if the transient photo-excited states above the Fermi energy $E_F$ can also be dressed, leaving the dynamical interplay between photo-excitation and light-field dressing elusive. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence for light-field dressing of the transient photo-excited surface states above $E_F$, which exhibits distinct dynamics with a delay response as compared to light-field dressed states below $E_F$. Our work reveals the dual roles of the pump pulse in both photo-excitation and light-field dressing, providing a more comprehensive picture with new insights on the light-induced manipulation of transient electronic states.</description>

      <title>Probing Remote Nuclear Magnetic Moments in hBN with VB Electron Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the initial discovery of optically addressable spins of the negatively charged boron vacancy defect (VB) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), substantial progress has been made, enabling promising applications in quantum sensing, information processing, and simulations. A deep understanding of the VB (electron): hBN (nuclear) spin systems is crucial for realizing these potentials. In this article, we employ Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) to demonstrate the sensing of dis tant nuclear spins via the VB electron spin. We identify the nature and localization of the probed nuclear magnetic moments as 14N spins localized 0.4 nm away from the vacancy and resolve the energies of the corresponding interactions. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations further confirm these findings, providing a detailed description of the interactions between the VB electron spin and surrounding nitrogen atoms in different shells. The results establish the VB electron spin as a promising tool for developing novel van der Waals material-based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes, advancing the understanding of spin physics in hBN, and unlocking its potential to study distant nuclear spin interactions in the host.</description>

      <title>Extended study of crystal structures, optical properties and vibrational spectra of polar 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen phosphite and bis(2-aminopyrimidinium) sulfate monohydrate and two 2-aminopyrimidinium hydrogen sulfate polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aimed primarily at completing and extending the characterization of the crystallographic, spectroscopic and optical properties of polar, biaxial, optically negative 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen phosphite. Besides the redetermination of the low-temperature crystal structure (space group P21), high-quality single crystals of this salt were grown from an aqueous solution, and their optical properties were studied. The determination of the refractive indices in the wavelength range of 435-1083 nm showed anomalous dispersion of the refractive indices, resulting in a point of uniaxiality. The crystal allows phase matching for collinear second harmonic generation (SHG) processes of both type I and type II in a broad wavelength range. SHG properties were studied for powdered size-fractioned samples and oriented single-crystal cuts. The optical damage threshold experiments confirmed excellent optical resistance - at least 220 TWm-2 and 70 TWm-2 for 800 and 1000 nm irradiation, respectively. The low-temperature crystallographic study was also extended for three monoclinic salts of 2-aminopyrimidine and sulfuric acid - i.e. bis(2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) sulfate monohydrate (space group P21/n) and two polymorphs of 2-aminopyrimidinium(1+) hydrogen sulfate (both with space group P21/c). The vibrational spectra of all title compounds were assigned using single-molecule quantum chemical computations (including Potential Energy Distribution analysis) in combination with the nuclear site group analysis. Spectroscopic results concerning sulfates of 2-aminopyrimidine provided valuable reference materials for the vibrational spectroscopic study and also addressed the question of their polymorphism. An optimal computational approach employing solid-state DFT calculations has also been sought to model the vibrational spectra of 2-aminopyrimidinium (1+) hydrogen phosphite crystals.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state discrimination of a Polyradical Nanog-raphene using Nickelocene-Functionalized Tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular magnets are a promising class of materials with exciting properties and applications. However, a profound understanding and application of such materials depends on the accurate detection of their electronic and magnetic properties. Despite the availability of experimental techniques that can sense the magnetic signal, the exact determination of the spin ground states and spatial distribution of exchange interaction of strongly correlated single-molecule magnets remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that scanning probe microscopy with a nickelocene-functionalized probe can distinguish between nearly degenerate multireference ground states of single-molecule {\pi}-magnets and map their spatial distribution of the exchange interaction. This method expands the already outstanding imaging capabilities of scanning probe microscopy for characterizing the chemical and electronic structures of individual molecules, paving the way for the study of strongly correlated molecular magnets with unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving black-box optimization problems with Ising machines is increasingly common in materials science. However, their application to crystal structure prediction (CSP) is still ineffective due to symmetry agnostic encoding of atomic coordinates. We introduce CRYSIM, an algorithm that encodes the space group, the Wyckoff positions combination, and coordinates of independent atomic sites as separate variables. This encoding reduces the search space substantially by exploiting the symmetry in space groups. When CRYSIM is interfaced to Fixstars Amplify, a GPU-based Ising machine, its prediction performance was competitive with CALYPSO and Bayesian optimization for crystals containing more than 150 atoms in a unit cell. Although it is not realistic to interface CRYSIM to current small-scale quantum devices, it has the potential to become the standard CSP algorithm in the coming quantum age.</description>

      <title>Enhancing TiFe Alloy Activation for Hydrogen Storage Through Al, Cr, Co, and Cu Substitutions as a Step Towards Future Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the activation behavior of $TiFe_{0.80}$-$X_{0.20}$ (X = Co, Cu, Cr, Al) alloys to identify the most effective materials for producing hydrogen storage alloys from recycled sources in view of a circular economy perspective. Activation was tested using two methods: a Sievert Volumetric Apparatus at room temperature and 64 bar of hydrogen, and high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry with 50 bar hydrogen under thermal cycles up to 400 {\deg}C. Activation properties were analyzed by assessing time for incubation and for full charging, that are influenced, respectively, by surface and bulk diffusion of hydrogen. Results showed that Cr-substituted alloys are rapidly activated, due to the presence of $TiCr_{2}$ compound, while Al-containing alloys absorbed hydrogen immediately. In contrast, Co- and Cu-substituted alloys required extended activation times, due to less quantity of secondary phases and limited diffusion channels.</description>

      <title>Screening of material defects using universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding new materials with previously unknown atomic structure or materials with optimal set of properties for a specific application greatly benefits from computational modeling. Recently, such screening has been dramatically accelerated by the invent of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials that offer first principles accuracy at orders of magnitude lower computational cost. Their application to the screening of defects with desired properties or to finding new stable compounds with high density of defects, however, has not been explored. Here, we show that the universal machine-learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to enable large-scale screening of defective materials. We carried out vacancy calculations for 86 259 materials in the Materials Project database and analyzed the formation energies in terms of oxidation numbers. We further demonstrate the application of these models for finding new materials at or below the convex hull of known materials and for simulated etching of low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Insights into Rare Earth Mineralization: Machine Learning Applications Using Functional Material Synthesis Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative understanding of rare earth element (REE) mineralization mechanisms, crucial for improving industrial separation, remains limited. This study leverages 1239 hydrothermal synthesis datapoints from material science as a surrogate for natural REE mineralization. We trained machine learning models (KNN, RF, XGBoost) using precursor, additive, and reaction data to predict product elements and phases, validating predictions with new experiments. XGBoost exhibited the highest accuracy, with feature importance analysis indicating thermodynamic properties were critical for predictions. Observed correlations among reaction parameters aligned with classical crystallization theory. Further XGBoost models successfully predicted reaction temperature and pH from precursor/product data. Our findings demonstrate the cross-disciplinary utility of material science data for geochemical understanding, underscore the need for research on less-studied REE minerals (e.g., carbonates, heavy REEs), and suggest potential to accelerate REE resource development.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-Mediated Control of Phase Formation and Microstructure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is key in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in materials production. At the same time, it significantly affects mechanical properties, often causing unwanted embrittlement. However, rather than solely addressing these disadvantages, hydrogens inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be leveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, we show that using hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical alloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic deformation of a composite of the high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu leads to amorphization while substituting the HEA by its hydride preserves the two-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly different hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion in the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route enables new microstructural states, even in well-studied material systems. It opens an additional dimension in designing materials with diverging hydrogen affinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.</description>

      <title>Spin state of iron in I-42d-type Mg2SiO4 at ultra-high pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At extreme pressures of approximately 500 GPa, conditions characteristic of the deep interiors of super-Earths, the combination of NaCl-type MgO and post-perovskite-type MgSiO3 (PPv) has been reported to produce a post-PPv phase of Mg2SiO4 with an I-42d symmetry. This post-PPv (pppv) silicate is proposed as the primary mantle silicate in these massive rocky exoplanets. Understanding the fundamental properties of pppv, particularly in solid solutions with Fe2SiO4, is crucial for insights into the interior dynamics and compositions of such planets. In this study, we conduct an ab initio investigation of the properties of Fe2+-bearing pppv at pressures ranging from 400 GPa to 1 TPa. Given the localized nature of 3d-electrons in iron, we employ the LDA+Usc method alongside conventional DFT functionals to probe the electronic structure of this system. The dependence of the Hubbard parameter U on volume and spin state is carefully evaluated. Furthermore, we systematically explore the effects of pressure, temperature, and structural variations on the spin state of iron in Fe2+-bearing pppv, providing valuable data to improve mantle modeling for super-Earth-type exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Inverse Single-sided Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-sided magnet generates a magnetic field on only one side while canceling it on the opposite side, a feature that has enabled diverse applications in both fundamental science and engineering. Here, we propose the {\it inverse} single-sided magnet: a non-ferromagnetic system that selectively attracts either the north or south pole of a ferromagnet while remaining unresponsive to the opposite pole. We demonstrate that such behavior can arise in microscopic octupolar magnets. To illustrate this, we analyze two minimal models: a coplanar magnetic structure with 120-degree ordering and a collinear magnetic structure with site-dependent anisotropy. In both cases, we find that the magnetization response is nonreciprocal with respect to the sign of the applied magnetic field. Notably, in the latter model, the system exhibits strong magnetization in one field direction and negligible response in the opposite direction. This diode-like behavior for magnetic fields suggests that inverse single-sided magnets could play a pivotal role in controlling magnetic interference, with potential impact comparable to conventional single-sided magnets.</description>

      <title>Modelling Lateral Spread in Wire Flat Rolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model for wire rolling is presented, focusing on predicting the lateral spread. This provides, for the first time, an analytic model of lateral spread without any fitting parameters. The model is derived directly from the governing equations; in order to obtain a simple model, a rigid perfectly plastic material is assumed and simplified with the assumption of small thickness and width compared to the length of the roll gap (effectively a thin-wire large-roller assumption). The mathematical model is compared against experiments performed on stainless steel wire using a 100mm diameter roller, and is shown to provide accurate predictions of lateral spread across a wide range of wire diameters (2.96mm-7.96mm) and reduction ratios (20%-60%), all without the need for fitting parameters. The model requires only seconds to compute and serves as a robust tool for validating FE results, guiding process design, and laying the foundation for future improved models.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive framework to simulate real-time chemical dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution. Our results establish a foundation for further quantum algorithm development targeting chemical and material dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Power of the Pareto Front: Balancing Uncertain Rewards for Adaptive Experimentation in scanning probe microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated experimentation has the potential to revolutionize scientific discovery, but its effectiveness depends on well-defined optimization targets, which are often uncertain or probabilistic in real-world settings. In this work, we demonstrate the application of Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) to balance multiple, competing rewards in autonomous experimentation. Using scanning probe microscopy (SPM) imaging, one of the most widely used and foundational SPM modes, we show that MOBO can optimize imaging parameters to enhance measurement quality, reproducibility, and efficiency. A key advantage of this approach is the ability to compute and analyze the Pareto front, which not only guides optimization but also provides physical insights into the trade-offs between different objectives. Additionally, MOBO offers a natural framework for human-in-the-loop decision-making, enabling researchers to fine-tune experimental trade-offs based on domain expertise. By standardizing high-quality, reproducible measurements and integrating human input into AI-driven optimization, this work highlights MOBO as a powerful tool for advancing autonomous scientific discovery.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice, arrays of strongly interacting nanomagnets, are complex magnetic systems with many emergent properties, rich microstate spaces, intrinsic physical memory, high-frequency dynamics in the GHz range and compatibility with a broad range of measurement approaches. This tutorial article aims to provide the foundational knowledge needed to understand, design, develop, and improve the dynamic properties of artificial spin ice (ASI). Special emphasis is placed on introducing the theory of micromagnetics, which describes the complex dynamics within these systems, along with their design, fabrication methods, and standard measurement and control techniques. The article begins with a review of the historical background, introducing the underlying physical phenomena and interactions that govern artificial spin ice. We then explore standard experimental techniques used to prepare the microstate space of the nanomagnetic array and to characterize magnetization dynamics, both in artificial spin ice and more broadly in ferromagnetic materials. Finally, we introduce the basics of neuromorphic computing applied to the case of artificial spin ice systems with goal to help researchers new to the field grasp these exciting new developments.</description>

      <title>Localization of deformation in the central hub of hub-and-spoke kirigami</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent approach to the design of flexible electronic devices consists of cutting a two-dimensional sheet to form a central hub connected to several tapered `spokes', resembling the hub-and-spoke of a bicycle wheel. When radially compressed, the resulting cut sheet buckles out-of-plane forming a structure whose three-dimensional shape can be chosen by designing the tapering of the spokes. While the deformation of the spokes in this `hub-and-spoke' kirigami are approximately cylindrical (i.e.~zero Gaussian curvature and hence small elastic strain), this is not the case in the central hub. The central hub is deformed radially because of continuity with the spokes but, because of its own circular symmetry, it must develop Gaussian curvature, and hence strain. In this article we quantify this strain, focussing in particular on its magnitude and its location. We find that the strain is localized in a boundary layer near the edge of the hub region, whose size is controlled by the moment applied on it by the deformed spokes. We discuss the implications of our results for avoiding material failure in flexible-electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) captures the variations of quantum states with parameters, serving as a central concept in modern quantum physics. Its real part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the \textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover, we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the Berry phase.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

Abstract: A proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture rich in Cs and O ions, able to emit an ion current both in positive and negative polarities, is presented. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field. In contrast to an "open" source design in which the conducting liquid covers the surface of a metallic needle, the presented setup uses a conical glass capillary as an emitter tip. {\ffcol The latter is observed by a camera, which revealed the formation of a bubble in the tip containing the molten salt. A glow was also observed during beam emission revealing the anchoring point of the stressed meniscus.} A stable ion beam emission of about 50 min and an intensity of several $\mu$A was obtained. The behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions is discussed, as its properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>

      <title>Growth of hexagonal BN crystals by traveling-solvent floating zone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for exploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that h-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The diameters of grown boules range from 3 - 5 mm with lengths from 2 - 10 mm. Tomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest having areas of $\approx$ 1 mm $\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\approx$ 0.5 mm. Although the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself is of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently optimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2} \approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h. Raman spectroscopy for an optimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the E$_{\mathrm{2g}}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$ for the E$_{\mathrm{2g}}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The corresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free exciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to carbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability of growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards larger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.</description>

      <title>Stability of the long-range corrected exchange-correlation functional and the Proca procedural functional in time-dependent density-functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic effects in the optical absorption spectra of solids can be described with time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) in the linear-response regime, using a simple class of approximate, long-range corrected (LRC) exchange-correlation functionals. It was recently demonstrated that the LRC approximation can also be employed in real-time TDDFT to describe exciton dynamics. Here, we investigate the numerical stability of the time-dependent LRC approach using a two-dimensional model solid. It is found that the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation with an LRC vector potential becomes more and more prone to instabilities for increasing exciton binding energies. The origin of these instabilities is traced back to time-averaged violations of the zero-force theorem, which leads to a simple and robust numerical stabilization scheme. This explains and justifies a recently proposed method by Dewhurst et al. [Phys. Rev. B 111, L060302 (2025)] to stabilize the LRC vector potential, known as the Proca procedural functional.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-guided construction of an analytic kinetic energy functional for orbital free density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) of kinetic energy functionals (KEF) for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) holds the promise of addressing an important bottleneck in large-scale ab initio materials modeling where sufficiently accurate analytic KEFs are lacking. However, ML models are not as easily handled as analytic expressions; they need to be provided in the form of algorithms and associated data. Here, we bridge the two approaches and construct an analytic expression for a KEF guided by interpretative machine learning of crystal cell-averaged kinetic energy densities ({\tau}) of several hundred materials. A previously published dataset including multiple phases of 433 unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In was used for training, including data at the equilibrium geometry as well as strained structures. A hybrid Gaussian process regression - neural network (GPR-NN) method was used to understand the type of functional dependence of {\tau} on the features which contained cell-averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the electron density and Kohn-Sham effective potential. Based on this analysis, an analytic model is constructed that can reproduce Kohn-Sham DFT energy-volume curves with sufficient accuracy (pronounced minima that are sufficiently close to the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT-based curves and with sufficiently close curvatures) to enable structure optimizations and elastic response calculations.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Theory of Large Phonon Magnetic Moments Induced by Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magnetic Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, characterized by nonzero angular momenta and magnetic moments, have attracted extensive attention. However, a long-standing critical issue in this field is the lack of an approach to accurately calculate phonon magnetic moments resulting from electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in realistic materials. Here, based on the linear response framework, we develop an ab initio theory for calculating EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons, applicable to both insulating and metallic materials. Then, we evidently demonstrate EPC-induced large phonon magnetic moments and phonon Zeeman splittings resulting from spin-phonon coupling in magnetic metals. Interestingly, these splittings can open substantial topologically nontrivial phonon gaps, generating intrinsic phonon Chern states. Further, by constructing an inertially decoupled lattice model, we predict candidate materials exhibiting such intrinsic phonon Chern states with robust edge phonon currents which are proposed to detect neutral particles, such as dark matter particles. Our work enables \emph{ab initio} calculations for EPC-induced magnetic properties of phonons and long-sought magnetic phonon spectra.</description>

      <title>On the Automation of High Throughput Modeling of Adsorption In Porous Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) have emerged as a promising candidate for catalysis, carbon-dioxide (CO$_{2}$) capture and storage as well as flue gas separation due to their tunable porosity and chemical stability. ZIFs consists of transition metals in a tetrahedral coordination with imidazolate linkers, allowing for structural modifications that can enhance CO$_{2}$ adsorption and storage. To systematically design and optimize ZIFs for superior CO$_{2}$ capture performance, theoretical modelling provides an effective approach, though hindered by the sheer size of the search space, with hundred to thousands of possible sites per ZIF, and thousands of possible ZIF that can be synthesized. In this work, we employ a high-throughput techniques underpinned by first-principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) to develop a systematic automated method for characterizing adsorption energetics in ZIFs, guiding the rational design and selection of desirable ZIF structures. Using high-throughput computing tools, we perform pore and pore size analysis, and implement automated CO$_{2}$ molecule placement algorithm, accounting for positional symmetry, crystallographic orientation, and collision detection. The results obtained are in good agreement with previous studies, demonstrating the reliability of the approach in accelerating the discovery of next-generation ZIFs for CO$_{2}$ capture and storage.</description>

      <title>Pyroelectric doping reversal of MoS2 p-n junctions on ferroelectric domain walls probed by photoluminescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tailoring the optical properties and electronic doping in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a central strategy for developing innovative systems with tunable characteristics. In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.</description>

      <title>Towards "on-demand" van der Waals epitaxy with hpc-driven online ensemble sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to achieve targeted epitaxial growth involves exploring a vast parameter space of thermodynamical and kinetic drivers (e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical potential etc). This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome to accelerate synthesis and characterization of novel materials with complex dependencies on local chemical environment, temperature and lattice-strains, specifically nanoscale heterostructures of layered 2D materials. We combine the strength of next generation supercomputers at the extreme scale, machine learning and classical molecular dynamics simulations within an adaptive real time closed-loop virtual environment steered by Bayesian optimization to enable asynchronous ensemble sampling of the synthesis space, and apply it to the recrystallization phenomena of amorphous transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) bilayer to form stack moir\'e heterostructures under various growth parameters. We show that such asynchronous ensemble sampling frameworks for materials simulations can be promising towards achieving on-demand epitaxy of van der Waals stacked moir\'e devices, paving the way towards a robust autonomous materials synthesis pipeline to enable unprecedented discovery of new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Design and development of advanced Al-Ti-V alloys for beampipe applications in particle accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present investigation reports the design and development of an advanced material with a high figure of merit (FoM) for beampipe applications in particle accelerators by bringing synergy between computational and experimental approaches. Machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the phase(s), low density, and high radiation length of the designed Al-Ti-V alloys. Al-Ti-V alloys with various compositions for single-phase and dual-phase mixtures, liquidus temperature, and density values are obtained using the Latin hypercube sampling method in TC Python Thermo-Calc software. The obtained dataset is utilized to train the machine-learning algorithms. Classification algorithms such as XGBoost and regression models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest regressor have been used to compute the number of phases, radiation length, and density respectively. The XGBoost algorithms show an accuracy of $98\%$, the Linear regression model shows an accuracy of $94\%$, and the Random Forest regressor model is accurate up to $99\%$. The developed Al-Ti-V alloys exhibit high radiation length as well as a good combination of high elastic modulus and toughness due to the synergistic effect of the presence of hard $Al_3Ti$ phase along with a minor volume fraction of FCC $(Al)_{ss}$ solid solution phase mixture. The comparison of our alloys, alloy-1 ($Al_{75.2}Ti_{22.8}V_{2}$) and alloy-2 ($Al_{89}Ti_{10}V_{1}$) shows an increase in the radiation length by seven-times and a decrease in the density by two to three times as compared to stainless steel 304, the preferred material for constructing beampipes in low-energy particle accelerators. Further, we experimentally verify the elastic modulus of the alloy-1 and compute the FoM equal to 0.416, which is better than other existing materials for beampipes in low-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Surface data imputation with stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spurious measurements frequently occur in surface data from technical components. Excluding or ignoring these spurious points may lead to incorrect surface characterization if these points inherit features of the surface. Therefore, data imputation must be applied to ensure that the estimated data points at spurious measurements do not deviate strongly from the true surface and its characteristics. Traditional surface data imputation methods rely on simple assumptions and ignore existing knowledge of the surface, resulting in suboptimal estimates. In this paper, we propose the use of stochastic processes for data imputation. This approach, which originates from surface texture simulation, allows a straightforward integration of a priori knowledge. We employ Gaussian processes with both stationary and non-stationary covariance structures to address missing values in surface data. In addition, we apply the method to a real-world scenario in which a spurious turned profile is obtained from an actual measurement. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method fills the missing values by maintaining the surface characteristics, particularly when surface features are missing.</description>

Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Hardening (LLH): Enhancing Deep Learning with Domain Knowledge for Material Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning and machine learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of the mechanical behavior of material microstructures is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To overcome data limitations, a two-step framework, Learning Latent Hardening (LLH), is proposed. In the first step of LLH, a Deep Neural Network is employed to reconstruct full stress-strain curves from randomly selected portions of the stress-strain curves to capture the latent mechanical response of a material based on key microstructural features. In the second step of LLH, the results of the reconstructed stress-strain curves are leveraged to predict key microstructural features of porous materials. The performance of six deep learning and/or machine learning models trained with and without domain knowledge are compared: Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results from the models with domain-specific information consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values compared to models without prior knowledge. Models without domain knowledge missed critical patterns linking stress-strain behavior to microstructural changes, whereas domain-informed models better identified essential stress-strain features predictive of microstructure. These findings highlight the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge with deep learning to achieve accurate outcomes in materials science.</description>
