      <title>Nuclear-spin-related properties of~the dual-frequency Doppler-free resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dual-frequency Doppler-free resonance in the D1 line of alkali-metal atoms for any accessible value of the nuclear spin I. The consideration is performed using the symmetries of the dipole operator and the basis, where the quantization axis is directed along the polarization of the one of optical waves. We show that there is the absence of the optical pumping in the scheme with parallel polarizations for the center of the crossover, resulting in its smallest width. Secondly, the growth in the absorption for the center of the peak with Fe=I-1/2 and the decrease of its width with the two-photon detuning in the case of~orthogonal polarizations is explained. Particular attention is paid to the special case of I=3/2, where this effect is the most pronounced. The experiment with 87Rb, 85Rb, and 133Cs atoms is in agreement with the analysis.</description>

      <title>Multipole decomposition of the thermal one-loop self-energy correction for a bound atomic electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the one-loop self-energy correction at finite temperature for the bound electron. In this approach, we study the influence of thermal radiation on atomic systems. Along the way, we found well-known effects, including thermal Stark and Zeeman shifts, as well as thermal quadrupole interactions and relativistic corrections to the multipole expansion of photon field operators. We show that the corresponding contributions arise from the decomposition of the fully relativistic expression in terms of the $\alpha Z$ parameter. The presented analysis unambiguously determines the consistency of the quantum electrodynamics theory at finite temperature (TQED) with the perturbation theory of quantum mechanics (QM). Although our analysis mainly focuses on the hydrogen atom model, their potential implications for precision spectroscopic experiments are discussed.</description>

      <title>A Robust COTS Objective for Diffraction-Limited, High-NA, Long Front Working Distance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust objective lens optimized for applications requiring both high numerical aperture (NA) and long front working distance imaging comprised of all commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) singlet lenses. Unlike traditional designs that require separate collimation and refocusing stages, our approach directly converges imaged light to the back focal plane using a single lens group. Our configuration corrects spherical aberrations and efficiently collects light to achieve diffraction-limited performance across a wide range of wavelengths while simplifying alignment and assembly. Using this approach, we design and construct an example objective lens that features a long front working distance of 61 mm and a clipped NA of 0.30 (limited by an aperture in our experimental setup). We experimentally verify that it achieves monochromatic diffraction-limited resolution at wavelengths from 375 nm to 866 nm without requiring replacement of the lenses or changing the inter-lens spacings, and its performance remains robust across a 46 mm range variation in total length (by adjusting mainly the back working distances). Additionally, we develop a quantitative method to measure the field of view (FOV) using an experimentally-calibrated pinhole target. Under 397 nm illumination (i.e. from $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion fluorescence), the objective achieves a resolution of 0.87 $\mu$m with a 540 $\mu$m FOV. This robust, all-COTS, and versatile design is well-suited for a broad range of experiments, supporting high-precision measurements and exploring quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observation of Self-Bound Droplets of Ultracold Dipolar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using $in$-$phase$ and $out$-$of$-$phase$ protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, $out$-$of$-$phase$ modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas $in$-$phase$ modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes (L $\ge $ 6). Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</description>

      <title>State-Dependent Quantum Copying and the limits of the No-Cloning Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the physical process of stimulated emission as a model for state-dependent quantum copying. We explore how a quantum state, for instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, effectively encodes prior information about the quantum state. This process, while resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its state-dependent and non-universal nature. We clarify the distinction between universal cloning and conditional copying, and demonstrate that stimulated emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum copying.</description>

Abstract: We perform a complete calculation of $\alpha\,(Z\,\alpha)^5\,m$ radiative corrections to the finite nuclear size, the recoil finite size and the nuclear polarizability effects in atomic systems. Results confirm very good agreement for the mean square charge radii difference $r_d^2-r_p^2$ between the deuteron and the proton, as measured in {\em electronic} and muonic isotope shifts.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity quantum state control of a polar molecular ion in a cryogenic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a quantum-logic spectroscopy (QLS) protocol to control the quantum state of a CaH+ ion in a cryogenic environment, in which reduced thermal radiation extends rotational state lifetimes by an order of magnitude over those at room temperature. By repeatedly and adaptively probing the molecule, detecting the outcome of each probe via an atomic ion, and using a Bayesian update scheme to quantify confidence in the molecular state, we demonstrate state preparation and measurement (SPAM) in a single quantum state with infidelity less than 6x10^-3 and measure Rabi flopping between two states with greater than 99% contrast. The protocol does not require any molecule-specific lasers and the detection scheme is non-destructive.</description>

      <title>Convergent close-coupling approach to ion collisions with multi-electron targets: Application to $\bar{p} + {\rm C}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-centre convergent close-coupling approach to ion-atom collisions has been extended to model collisions involving arbitrary multi-electron atoms and partially stripped ions. This is accomplished by generating a set of target pseudostates using the configuration interaction method. The resulting pseudostates are expanded in terms of configuration state functions, constructed using a hybrid of Hartree-Fock and Coulomb-Sturmian spin-orbitals. This new approach is applied to study antiproton collisions with atomic carbon. We present excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and the dipole polarisability obtained using the target structure model to validate its accuracy. Furthermore, we present results for elastic-scattering, total excitation, and ionisation cross sections in the incident energy range between 10 to 1000 keV. State-resolved excitation cross sections for the first few dominant transitions are also presented. Throughout the manuscript, we compare results obtained using the multi-core target structure model with those from a frozen-core one. In all cases, we find that a multi-core description of the carbon atom target is essential for accurately modelling these collisions.</description>

      <title>Toward Quantum Analog Simulation of Many-Body Supersymmetry with Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological quantum number, the Witten index, characterizes supersymmetric models by probing for zero energy modes and the possibility of supersymmetry breaking. We propose an averaging method to infer the Witten index in quantum analog simulators. Motivated by recent work on Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays, we consider a related supersymmetric XXZ spin model. We show how to infer the Witten index from open system averaging and numerically demonstrate its topological robustness in this model. Our Letter defines a route for quantum analog simulators to directly identify many-body topological physics.</description>

      <title>Data-insensitive cooling of polar molecules with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent, we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species, thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.</description>
