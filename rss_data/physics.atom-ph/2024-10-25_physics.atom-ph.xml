      <title>Frequency-dependent amplitude correction to free-precession scalar magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump and probe scalar atomic magnetometers show incredible potential for real-world, traditionally difficult measurement environments due to their high dynamic range and linearity. Previously, it has been assumed these scalar magnetometer have a flat response across their bandwidth, and flat noise floor. Here we show that standard fitting routines, used to extract the magnetic field, result in a non-linear frequency dependent response across the sensor bandwidth, due to the time-averaged nature of such free precession measurements. We present an analytic correction dependent on dead-time, and show how this equation can also correct the sensor spectral density. The maximum in-band amplitude loss approaches 29\% as the frequency of interest becomes the Nyquist frequency, making a significant correction for applications such as source localization in magnetoencephalography. These pump and probe atomic magnetometers also are known to have large aliasing of out-of-band signals, and we propose a scheme where the frequency of out-of-band signals can be identified by performing fits with varying dead-time on the raw free-precession sensor data.</description>

      <title>Spatial averaging for light reflection and transmission through cold atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging my lead to inaccurate results.</description>

      <title>Electron recollisional excitation of OCS$^+$ in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flips at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that this energy shift between the OCS$^+$ and S$^+$ channels corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and that electron recollisional excitation takes place to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>

      <title>Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides push the limit of mechanical stiffness and glass-like thermal conductivity in single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insulating materials featuring ultralow thermal conductivity for diverse applications also require robust mechanical properties. Conventional thinking, however, which correlates strong bonding with high atomic-vibration-mediated heat conduction, led to diverse weakly bonded materials that feature ultralow thermal conductivity and low elastic moduli. One must, therefore, search for strongly-bonded single crystals in which heat transport is impeded by other means. Here, we report intrinsic, glass-like, ultralow thermal conductivity and ultrahigh elastic-modulus/thermal-conductivity ratio in single-crystalline Ruddlesden-Popper Ban+1ZrnS3n+1, n = 2,3, which are derivatives of BaZrS3. Their key features are strong anharmonicity and intra-unit-cell rock-salt blocks. The latter produce strongly bonded intrinsic superlattices, impeding heat conduction by broadband reduction of phonon velocities and mean free paths and concomitant strong phonon localization. The present study initiates a paradigm of mechanically stiff phonon glasses.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>
