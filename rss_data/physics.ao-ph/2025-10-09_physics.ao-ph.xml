      <title>Developing a Sequential Deep Learning Pipeline to Model Alaskan Permafrost Thaw Under Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing climate conditions threaten the natural permafrost thaw-freeze cycle, leading to year-round soil temperatures above 0{\deg}C. In Alaska, the warming of the topmost permafrost layer, known as the active layer, signals elevated greenhouse gas release due to high carbon storage. Accurate soil temperature prediction is therefore essential for risk mitigation and stability assessment; however, many existing approaches overlook the numerous factors driving soil thermal dynamics. This study presents a proof-of-concept latitude-based deep learning pipeline for modeling yearly soil temperatures across multiple depths. The framework employs dynamic reanalysis feature data from the ERA5-Land dataset, static geologic and lithological features, sliding-window sequences for seasonal context, a derived scenario signal feature for long-term climate forcing, and latitude band embeddings for spatial sensitivity. Five deep learning models were tested: a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a Transformer, a 1-Dimensional Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (Conv1DLSTM), a Gated-Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). Results showed solid recognition of latitudinal and depth-wise temperature discrepancies, with the GRU performing best in sequential temperature pattern detection. Bias-corrected CMIP5 RCP data enabled recognition of sinusoidal temperature trends, though limited divergence between scenarios were observed. This study establishes an end-to-end framework for adopting deep learning in active layer temperature modeling, offering seasonal, spatial, and vertical temperature context without intrinsic restrictions on feature selection.</description>

      <title>Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse &amp; noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.</description>

      <title>Skill of Long-Range Forecasts of Ocean Wave Spectra from the Navy ESPC Version 2 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06484v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the outcome of evaluations of the skill of long-range forecasts from the ocean wave model component of the Navy's global coupled modeling system. Specifically, the model output is taken from a single member of the ensemble system, and we evaluate the skill of predicting seven model "wave height" parameters, computed from: energy in four frequency bands, energy in all bands combined, swell energy, and wind sea energy. The model is evaluated using two methods of "ground truth". The first is a new instrument for measuring wave spectra from space, Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM). The second is analyses from the same model. We propose a new method of band-wise bias correction of the observational dataset, using in situ wave observations, with the numerical wave model used as an intermediary.</description>

      <title>Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000-2025) using an LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01555v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, has been practiced in the western United States since the 1940s. However, comprehensive datasets are not currently available to analyze these efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000-2025, including the project name, year, season, state, operator, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, stated purpose, target area, control area, start date, and end date. Combining our multi-stage PDF-to-text extraction pipeline with OpenAI's o3 large language model (LLM), we processed 832 historical reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The resulting dataset demonstrates 98.38% estimated accuracy, based on manual review of 200 randomly sampled records, and is publicly available on Zenodo. This dataset addresses the gap in cloud seeding data and demonstrates the potential for LLMs to extract structured information from historical environmental documents. More broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data from scanned documents across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Evolution of Global Atmospheric Rivers with Vapor Kinetic Energy Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) often cause damaging winds, rainfall, and floods. However, the physical mechanisms governing their evolution remain poorly understood. To close this gap, we perform a global Vapor Kinetic Energy (VKE) budget analysis. Using two formulations of VKE, we show that ARs are governed by similar mechanisms regardless of ocean basins. ARs intensify primarily through the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy (PE-to-KE), with horizontal convergence of vapor kinetic energy providing a secondary contribution in some regions. ARs decay mainly through condensation and turbulent dissipation, while their propagation is governed by the downstream convergence and upstream divergence of vapor kinetic energy. We also find PE-to-KE conversion varies spatially and strengthens in regions of greater baroclinic instability or enhanced topographic lifting, e.g., along North America's west coast. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the VKE framework provides a powerful diagnostic for how physical processes shape AR evolution and regional variability.</description>

      <title>Representing Subgrid-Scale Cloud Effects in a Radiation Parameterization using Machine Learning: MLe-radiation v1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improvements of Machine Learning (ML)-based radiation emulators remain constrained by the underlying assumptions to represent horizontal and vertical subgrid-scale cloud distributions, which continue to introduce substantial uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a method to represent the impact of subgrid-scale clouds by applying ML to learn processes from high-resolution model output with a horizontal grid spacing of 5km. In global storm resolving models, clouds begin to be explicitly resolved. Coarse-graining these high-resolution simulations to the resolution of coarser Earth System Models yields radiative heating rates that implicitly include subgrid-scale cloud effects, without assumptions about their horizontal or vertical distributions. We define the cloud radiative impact as the difference between all-sky and clear-sky radiative fluxes, and train the ML component solely on this cloud-induced contribution to heating rates. The clear-sky tendencies remain being computed with a conventional physics-based radiation scheme. This hybrid design enhances generalization, since the machine-learned part addresses only subgrid-scale cloud effects, while the clear-sky component remains responsive to changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations. Applied to coarse-grained data offline, the ML-enhanced radiation scheme reduces errors by a factor of 4-10 compared with a conventional coarse-scale radiation scheme. This shows the potential of representing subgrid-scale cloud effects in radiation schemes with ML for the next generation of Earth System Models.</description>

      <title>Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</description>

      <title>Probing forced responses and causal mechanisms in large-scale climate dynamics with reduced-order neural models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture not only stationary statistics but also responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators seek to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. Response theory offers a rigorous framework to explore these limitations, moving beyond stationary statistics, probing causal mechanisms, and guiding model design. Using a simplified multiscale system, we argue that the skill of purely data-driven models in reproducing perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying the proper variables to model, including spatial and temporal scales, and (ii) accurate stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes. For studies of low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights motivate reduced-order neural models, tailored to specific processes, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We illustrate this perspective with a reduced-order neural stochastic model designed to investigate responses of radiative fluxes to surface temperature perturbations. The model largely reproduces stationary statistics and enables the study of forced responses in both ensemble mean and variance, shifting the study of climate feedbacks from single trajectories to responses of probability distributions. These results underscore reduced-order models, augmented with modern neural networks and evaluated within the framework of response theory, as a practical strategy for causal inference and attribution studies in large-scale climate dynamics.</description>
