      <title>Hidden symmetries and the generic spectral setting of generalized laplacians on homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to establish the spectral setting of some generalized Laplace operators associated to a generic $G$-invariant metric on a compact homogeneous space $M=G/K$. We show that this generic spectral configuration depends on the $G$-isometries and on some certain hidden symmetries constructed in the adjacent structures of $M$ and of these operators.</description>

      <title>Infinitely Many Surfaces with Prescribed Mean Curvature in the Presence of a Strictly Stable Minimal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many distinct hypersurfaces with prescribed mean curvature (PMC) for a large class of prescribing functions when $(M^{n+1}, g)$ is a closed smooth manifold containing a minimal surface that is strictly stable (or more generally, admits a contracting neighborhood). In particular, we construct infinitely many distinct PMCs when $H_n(M, \mathbb{Z}_2) \neq 0$, or if $(M, g)$ does not satisfy the Frankel property. Our construction synthesizes ideas from Song's construction of infinitely many minimal surfaces in the non-generic setting, Dey's construction of multiple constant mean curvature surfaces, and Sun--Wang--Zhou's min-max construction of free boundary PMCs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Harnack Inequality for Mean Curvature Flow and Ancient Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to relax convexity assumption on some classical results in mean curvature flow. In the first half of the paper, we prove a generalized version of Hamilton's differential Harnack inequality which holds for mean convex solutions to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1}{H}$ where $\lambda_1$ is the smallest principal curvature. Then, we use classical maximum principle to provide several characterizations of family of shrinking spheres for closed, mean convex ancient solution to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1 + .. + \lambda_k}{H}$ for some $1 \leq k \leq d-1$, where $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq .. \leq \lambda_d$ are the principal curvatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the horizontal holonomy group of a K-contact sub-Riemannian manifold either coincides with the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold, or it is a codimension-one normal subgroup of the later group. The question of existence of parallel horizontal spinors, examples, and consequences are discussed.</description>

      <title>Foliated Plateau problems, geometric rigidity and equidistribution of closed $k$-surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we survey recent advances in the study of dynamical properties of the space of surfaces with constant curvature in three-dimensional manifolds of negative sectional curvature. We interpret this space as a two-dimensional analogue of the geodesic flow and explore the extent to which the thermodynamic properties of the latter can be generalized to the surface setting. Additionally, we apply this theory to derive geometric rigidity results, including the rigidity of the hyperbolic marked area spectrum.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on singular capillary cones with free boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimizing singular cones with free boundary associated with the capillarity problem. Precisely, we provide a stability criterion $\`a$ la Jerison-Savin for capillary hypersurfaces and show that, in dimensions up to $4$, minimizing cones with non-sign-changing mean curvature are flat. We apply this criterion to minimizing capillary drops and, additionally, establish the instability of non-trivial axially symmetric cones in dimensions up to $6$.
  The main results are based on a Simons-type inequality for a class of convex, homogeneous, symmetric functions of the principal curvatures, combined with a boundary condition specific to the capillary setting.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian Yang-Mills-Higgs and Plateau's problem in codimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-Yang-Mills-Higgs energy $E(\Phi,A)=\int_M|d_A\Phi|^2+|F_A|^2$ in the large mass limit, proving convergence to the codimension-three area functional in the sense of De Giorgi's $\Gamma$-convergence. More precisely, for a compact manifold with boundary $M$ and any family of pairs $\Phi_m\in\Omega^0(M;\mathfrak{su}(2))$ and $A_m\in \Omega^1(M;\mathfrak{su}(2))$ indexed by a mass parameter $m\to\infty$, satisfying $$E(\Phi_m,A_m)\leq Cm\quad\text{and}\quad\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{m}\int_M(m-|\Phi_m|)^2=0,$$ we prove that the $(n-3)$-currents dual to $\frac{1}{2\pi m}\mathrm{tr}(d_{A_m}\Phi_m\wedge F_{A_m})$ converge subsequentially to a relative integral $(n-3)$-cycle $T$ of mass \begin{equation}
  \mathbb{M}(T)\leq \liminf_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi m}E(\Phi_m,A_m), \end{equation} and show conversely that any integral $(n-3)$-current $T$ with $[T]=0\in H_{n-3}(M,\partial M;\mathbb{Z})$ admits such an approximation, with equality in the above inequality. In the special case of pairs $(\Phi_m,A_m)$ satisfying the generalized monopole equation $*d_{A_m}\Phi_m=F_{A_m}\wedge \Theta$ for a calibration form $\Theta\in \Omega^{n-3}(M)$, we deduce that the limit $\nu=\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi m}|d_{A_m}\Phi_m|^2$ of the Dirichlet energy measures satisfies $\nu\leq |T|$, with equality if and only if $T$ is calibrated by $\Theta$, giving evidence for predictions of Donaldson-Segal in the settings of $G_2$-manifolds and Calabi-Yau $3$-folds.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of magnetic geodesic flows on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic geodesic flows invariant under rotations on the 2-sphere. The dynamical system is given by a generic pair of functions $(f,\Lambda)$ in one variable. Topology of the Liouville fibration of the given integrable system near its singular orbits and singular fibers is described. Types of these singularities are computed. Topology of the Liouville fibration on regular 3-dimensional isoenergy manifolds is described by computing the Fomenko--Zieschang invariant. All possible bifurcation diagrams of the momentum maps of such integrable systems are described. It is shown that the bifurcation diagram consists of two curves in the $(h,k)$-plane. One of these curves is a line segment $h=0$, and the other lies in the half-plane $h\ge0$ and can be obtained from the curve $(a:-1:k) = (f:\Lambda:1)^*$ projectively dual to the curve $(f:\Lambda:1)$ by the transformation $(a:-1:k)\mapsto(a^2/2,k)=(h,k)$.</description>

      <title>Killing and homothetic initial data for general hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a collection of general identities relating the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}g$ of an arbitrary vector field $\eta$ with the tensor $\Sigma=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}\nabla$ on an abstract hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ of any causal character. As an application we establish necessary conditions on $\mathcal{H}$ for the existence of a homothetic Killing vector on the spacetime where $\mathcal{H}$ is embedded. The sufficiency of these conditions is then analysed in three specific settings. For spacelike hypersurfaces, we recover the well-known homothetic KID equations [10, 13] in the language of hypersurface data. For two intersecting null hypersurfaces, we generalize a previous result [7], valid for Killings, to the homothetic case and, moreover, demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e., without involving a priori spacetime quantities. This puts the characteristic KID problem on equal footing with the spacelike KID problem. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of the formalism by addressing the homothetic KID problem for smooth spacelike-characteristic initial data. Other initial value problems, such as the spacelike-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.</description>

      <title>Curvature equations coupling symmetric tensors with a metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are described hierarchies of equations coupling a metric with a trace-free tensor having prescribed symmetries and in the kernel of certain generalized gradients. These specialize, when the tensor vanishes identically, to the usual hierarchy of constant sectional curvature (projectively flat), Einstein, and constant scalar curvature. At the Ricci curvature level these equations are formal analogues of the Einstein-Maxwell and supergravity equations that couple differential forms with a metric. The particular cases coupling a metric with trace-free symmetric tensors satisfying the Codazzi or conformal Killing equations are studied in detail. Examples of solutions are obtained from mean curvature zero immersions, affine spheres, isoparametric hypersurfaces, and related algebraic constructions. The formalism yields a hierarchy of curvature equations for statistical structures. There are deduced constraints on the scalar curvature of the metric occurring in a solution that generalize classical results of Simons, for mean curvature zero hypersurfaces in spheres, and of Calabi, for hyperbolic affine spheres.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the construction based on topological suspension of a family of compact non-K\"ahler complex manifolds with trivial canonical bundle given by L. Qin and B. Wang in [QW], we study toric suspensions of balanced manifolds by holomorphic automorphisms. In particular, we show that toric suspensions of Calabi-Yau manifolds are balanced. We also prove that suspensions associated with hyperbolic automorphisms of hyperk\"ahler manifolds do not admit any pluriclosed, astheno-K\"ahler or p-pluriclosed Hermitian metric. Moreover, we consider natural extensions for hypercomplex manifolds, providing some explicit examples of compact holomorphic symplectic and hypercomplex non-K\"ahler manifolds. We also show that a modified suspension construction provides examples with pluriclosed metrics.</description>

      <title>Convex valuations, from Whitney to Nash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Whitney problem for valuations: does a smooth $j$-homogeneous translation-invariant valuation on $\mathbb R^n$ exist that has given restrictions to a fixed family $S$ of linear subspaces? A necessary condition is compatibility: the given valuations must coincide on intersections. We show that for $S=\mathrm{Gr}_r(\mathbb R^n)$, the grassmannian of $r$-planes, this condition becomes sufficient once $r\geq j+2$. This complements the Klain and Schneider uniqueness theorems with an existence statement, and provides a recursive description of the image of the cosine transform. Informally speaking, we show that the transition from densities to valuations is localized to codimension $2$.
  We then look for conditions on $S$ when compatibility is also sufficient for extensibility, in two distinct regimes: finite arrangements of subspaces, and compact submanifolds of the grassmannian. In both regimes we find unexpected flexibility. As a consequence of the submanifold regime, we prove a Nash-type theorem for valuations on compact manifolds, from which in turn we deduce the existence of Crofton formulas for all smooth valuations on manifolds. As an intermediate step of independent interest, we construct Crofton formulas for all odd translation-invariant valuations.</description>

      <title>On completeness of foliated structures, and null Killing fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a compact manifold $(M,\mathfrak{F})$ with a foliation $\mathfrak{F}$, and a smooth affine connection $\nabla$ on the tangent bundle of the foliation $T\mathfrak{F}$. We introduce and study a foliated completeness problem. Namely, under which conditions on $\nabla$ the leaves are complete? We consider different natural geometric settings: the first one is the case of a totally geodesic lightlike foliation of a compact Lorentzian manifold, and the second one is the case where the leaves have particular affine structures. In the first case, we characterize the completeness, and obtain in particular that if a compact Lorentzian manifold admits a null Killing field $V$ such that the distribution orthogonal to $V$ is integrable, then it defines a (totally geodesic) foliation with complete leaves. In the second case, we give a completeness result for a specific affine structure called "the unimodular affine lightlike geometry", and characterize the completeness for a natural relaxation of the geometry. On the other hand, we study the global completeness of a compact Lorentzian manifold in the presence of a null Killing field. We give two non-complete examples, starting from dimension $3$: one is a locally homogeneous manifold, and the other is a $3$D example where the Killing field dynamics is equicontinuous.</description>
