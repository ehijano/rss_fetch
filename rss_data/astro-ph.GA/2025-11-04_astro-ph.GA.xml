      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). XII. The Formation and Evolution of Extended HI Galactic Disks and Warps with a Dynamic CGM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is an important component of gas in and around galaxies and forms extended disk-like structures well beyond the extent of starlight. Here we investigate the properties and evolution of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. We focus on the formation, evolution, and morphology of extended gaseous disks that emerge in all six systems. We find that median HI column densities drop sharply at the disk edge, with mean column densities outside the disk dominated by dense (NHI~10^19 cm-2), clumpy structures. All systems have significant misaligned features (warps or polar rings) at some point in their evolution; however, their frequencies, lifetimes, and origins vary significantly. We find that the morphology of the FOGGIE disks are correlated with properties of their Circumgalactic Medium (CGM). We classify these systems into two broad categories: those with CGMs that are Less Populated with HI and those with CGMs that are More Populated with HI. Both categories kinematically settle by z=0, but the Less Populated systems all form thin disks by z=0, while the More Populated systems do not. This classification is independent of disk and halo mass, implying the formation of a thin disk is influenced by local environmental factors. Our results indicate a connection between CGM content and disk formation that is not yet fully understood. A second paper investigates observational aspects of these structures.</description>

      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE). XIII. On the Observability of Extended HI Disks and Warps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic Hydrogen (HI) is a useful tracer of gas in and around galaxies, and can be found in extended disk-like structures well beyond a system's optical extent. Here we investigate the properties of extended HI disks that emerge in six Milky Way-mass galaxies using cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE) suite. This paper focuses on the observability of the extended HI in these systems. We find overall agreement with observational constraints on the HI size-mass relation. To facilitate direct comparisons with observations, we present synthetic HI 21-cm emission cubes. By spatially filtering our synthetic cubes to mimic the absence of short baselines in interferometric maps, we find that such observations can miss ~10-40% of diffuse emission, which preferentially removes low column density, low velocity dispersion gas outside the central disk. The amount of observable material depends strongly on its distribution and the system's observed orientation, preventing the formulation of a simple correction factor. Therefore, to fully characterize extended disks, their circumgalactic mediums, and the interfaces between them, dual convolutions including data from interferometers and large single-dish radio telescopes are required.</description>

      <title>Seeds to success: growing heavy black holes in dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational dearth of black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim$100 and 100,000 $M_\odot$ raises questions about the nature of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Proposed formation channels for IMBHs include runaway stellar collisions and repeated binary BH (BBH) mergers driven by dynamical interactions in stellar clusters, but the formation efficiency of these processes and the associated IMBH occupation fraction are largely unconstrained. In this work, we study IMBH formation via both mechanisms in young, globular, and nuclear star clusters. We carry out a comprehensive investigation of IMBH formation efficiency by exploring the impact of different seeding models and star cluster formation histories. We employ a new version of the B-POP population synthesis code, able to model several seeding mechanisms as well as hierarchical BBH mergers. We quantify the efficiency of IMBH production across different cluster families, and estimate the fraction of BBH mergers involving an IMBH primary. Comparison with low-redshift IMBH candidates suggests that, depending on the seeding mechanism, stellar collisions can play a pivotal role in explaining potential IMBHs in local globular clusters. Our simulations highlight stellar collisions as the primary IMBH formation channel across a wide range of cluster types. They further suggest that wandering IMBHs may populate Milky Way-like galaxies and that correlations between cluster and IMBH masses can help distinguish the origins of Galactic globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Tracing Multiphase Structure in the Circumgalactic Medium: Insights from Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding a galaxy's halo, and it plays a vital role in the galactic baryon cycle. However, its mass distribution across the virial phase and the cooler, denser atomic phase, remains uncertain. To investigate this, we perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of 0.125--8 kpc-scale representative patches of the CGM, with parameters informed by quasar absorption line observations. Our simulations resolve the cooling length (the minimum across all temperatures of $c_s t_{\rm cool}$, where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $t_{\rm cool}$ is the cooling time in isobaric conditions), allowing us to track the evolution of cold gas more accurately. We find that low-density CGM gas ($3\times10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$) cannot sustain cold gas below $10^4$ K for long, due to a large value of the ratio between the cooling to mixing time ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm mix}$). In contrast, higher-density environments ($3\times10^{-3}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) reach a turbulent multiphase steady state, with up to $50\%$ of the mass in the cold phase, occupying only about $1\%$ of the volume. To connect with large-volume cosmological simulations and small ${\rm pc}$-scale idealized simulations, we explore different box sizes (0.125--8 kpc) and identify a key scaling relation: simulations with similar $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm mix}$ exhibit comparable cold gas mass fractions and lifetimes. Importantly, we find that simply sub-sampling (reducing box-size) a small region from a large-volume simulation while maintaining a constant turbulent energy density injection rate from larger to smaller scales artificially shortens $t_\mathrm{mix}$, leading to inaccurate predictions for cold gas survival. This means that cold gas at small $\lesssim 10$ kpc scales arises in relatively dense, quiescent regions of the CGM rather than the turbulent ones undergoing cascade from large scales.</description>

      <title>Chemodynamic evidence of pristine gas accretion in the void galaxy VGS 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion of metal-poor gas is expected to be an important channel of gas replenishment in galaxy evolution studies. However, observational evidence of this process is still relatively scarce. The unusual polar disk galaxy VGS 12 was found in the Void Galaxy Survey. It appears to be isolated and resides in the cosmological wall between two large voids. The suggested formation scenario for this peculiar system is accretion of metal-poor gas from the void interior. We present the data on the gas-phase chemical abundance of VGS 12 obtained with the Russian 6m telescope BTA. We complement our analysis with HI data obtained with VLA and the data on the kinematics of the ionized gas. VGS 12 appears to be a strong outlier from the "metallicity - luminosity" relation, with gas oxygen abundance ~0.7dex lower than expected for its luminosity. The nitrogen abundance, on the other hand, is higher than what is typically observed in galaxies with similar metallicity, but is consistent with the metallicity expected given its luminosity. Such behavior is what is expected in the case of metal-poor gas accretion. The HI reveals clear morphological and kinematical asymmetry between the northern and southern parts of the disk, which are likely related to its unsettled state due to the recent accretion event. The kinematics of the ionized gas seen in Halpha reveal prolate rotation and follow closely the rotation of the HI disk, so we suggest this is accreted HI gas ionized by the stars in the central region of the galaxy. Together, our findings provide strong, multiwavelength evidence of ongoing cold gas accretion in a galaxy caught in the act of growing from the cosmic web. This is one of the very few individual galaxies where a convincing case can be made for such a process, and demonstrates the potential for cold accretion to contribute to galaxy growth even in the low-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>A Milky Way mass model for isolated simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00240v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an equilibrium model of a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy that supports open, mostly 2- and 3-arm spiral patterns but does not form a bar. It is suggested as a more realistic alternative model to that employed by the Agora collaboration; their model has a much lower disk mass and therefore forms only multi-arm spiral patterns. This improved model should enable simulations that test star-formation and feedback models in a more realistic isolated galaxy. Three versions of the same model having $2.1\times 10^5$, $2.1\times 10^6$, and $2.1\times 10^7$ particles are available for download.</description>

      <title>The Universality of Dark Matter Density Profiles for Milky Way Analog Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure, extent, and mass of the Milky Way's (MW) dark matter (DM) halo are observationally challenging to determine due to our position within the Galaxy. To overcome this limitation, we study a combined sample of 127 MW analogs from the IllustrisTNG-50 cosmological simulation with observations of 11 nearby galaxies. Using both spatial and spectral high-resolution data from VLA and GMRT telescopes, we employ the 3D-Barolo algorithm to derive precise kinematic maps and rotation curves (RCs). To perform a careful analysis of the stellar component, we use Spitzer mid-IR imaging at 3.6 and 4.5um. We decompose the RCs into their different mass components, enabling the construction of a DM radial profile for each galaxy. By using a MCMC-based routine, we account for the DM contribution for the observed RCs. For our simulated sample, we obtain DM radial profiles directly from the TNG50 database. We probe for the universality of the DM profiles by deriving and comparing the equivalent local DM density (LDMD), a critical parameter linked to DM direct detection experiments on Earth. We calculate the DM density at the corresponding location of the Sun in each of the analogs. Our analysis yields a final LDMD range of 0.17-0.46 GeV cm^-3. Finally, by leveraging our mass estimates (M200}, Mgas and Mstar), we contextualize our findings with the efficiency of star formation in MW analogs and with the diversity of galaxies inhabiting similar halo masses.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal Pressures: Key to Energy Balance and Structure Formation Near Sgr A* in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumnuclear region of the Galactic Center offers a unique laboratory to study energy balance and structure formation around Sgr A$\star$. This work investigates thermal and nonthermal processes within 7 pc distance from Sgr A$\star$. Using MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum data and ALMA H40 radio recombination line emission from the ACES survey, we separate free-free and synchrotron components at $\sim$0.2 pc resolution. With a thermal fraction of $\simeq$13%, the 1.3 GHz emission shows tight correlations with the Herschel PACS infrared data. The correlation between the equipartition magnetic field and molecular gas traced by JCMT $^{12}$CO (J=3$\rightarrow$2) observations reveals a balance between the magnetic field, cosmic rays, and molecular gas pressures south of the circumnuclear disk on $\sim$0.7 pc scales. Unlike the magnetic field and ionized gas, the molecular gas density declines in the cavity (R$\leq$2 pc) toward the center, likely due to feedback from Sgr A$\star$. We find that nonthermal pressure from turbulent gas nearly balances magnetic and cosmic ray pressures and exceeds thermal pressure by two orders of magnitude. The medium surrounding Sgr A$\star$ is filled by a low-$\beta$ (thermal-to-magnetic energy), supersonic plasma, with an Alfv\'en Mach number $\simeq$ 4 (assuming equipartition). Analysis of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio suggests that the circumnuclear region is mostly subcritical and, therefore, the magnetic field can help stabilize gas clouds against gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS Survey: gas-phase metallicity evolution at 2 &lt; z &lt; 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relationship (MZR) and fundamental metallicity relationship (FMR) for $65$ star-forming galaxies at $2 &lt; z &lt; 8$ from the JWST/EXCELS survey. We calculate gas-phase metallicities (12 + log(O/H)) using strong-line calibrations explicitly tested against the EXCELS sample, and report direct-method metallicities for $25$ galaxies. Our sample spans $8.1&lt;\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot)&lt;10.3$ in stellar mass and $0&lt;\log(\rm SFR/M_\odot \, yr^{-1})&lt;2$ in star-formation rate, consistent with typical main-sequence star-forming galaxies at the same redshifts. We find a clear MZR at both $2&lt;z&lt;4$ ($\langle z \rangle = 3.2$) and $4&lt;z&lt;8$ ($\langle z \rangle = 5.5$), with consistent slopes and mild evolution in normalization of $\simeq 0.1 \, \mathrm{dex}$, matching trends from simulations and recent observations. Our results demonstrate rapid gas-phase enrichment in the early Universe, with galaxies at fixed mass reaching $\simeq 50$ per cent of their present-day metallicity by $z \simeq 3$ (within the first $\simeq 15$ per cent of cosmic time). We find tentative evidence for SFR-dependence in the MZR scatter, though the results remain inconclusive and highlight the need for larger high-redshift samples. Comparison with locally derived FMRs reveals a clear offset consistent with other $z &gt; 3$ studies. We discuss potential drivers of this offset, noting that high-redshift samples have significantly different physical properties compared to local samples used to define the $z=0$ FMR. Our results confirm that low-mass, high specific star-formation rate galaxies common at high redshift are inconsistent with the equilibrium conditions underlying the local FMR, and highlight the rapid chemical enrichment at early cosmic epochs.</description>

      <title>The Flocculent Structure of the Inner Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of HI published in 1957 by Westerhout and Schmidt were presented as showing a global face-on view of spiral structure in the Milky Way. Since then many studies have attempted to improve on the early map, perhaps presupposing our Galaxy to be characterized by a Grand-design pattern of prominent spiral arms. We consider here two approaches to explore the nature of spiral structure of the inner Milky Way disk using the HI4PI survey. The first is to search for shallow shoulders in the high-velocity wings of HI data along the Galactic equatorial disk of the inner Milky Way that would be expected if the lines of sight swept across interarm regions of low HI density. The second is to look for broad dips in the integrated HI brightness temperature over the high-velocity wings, pertaining to gas near the subcentral region, that would be expected for the interarm region of a Grand-design. We find neither shallow shoulders nor broad dips in either the Northern quadrant I or the Southern quadrant IV indicating that the Milky Way seen interior to the Solar orbit is not characterized by a majestic spiral-structure Grand-design; this conclusion is a robust one, in that it does not depend on measures of distance. Taken together with decades of work on the bits and pieces of the quite disorganized shambles of the inner Galaxy, we suggest that the Milky Way belongs to the category of Flocculent spirals.</description>

      <title>Outside-In Evolution with a Twist: Metallicity Gradients and Asymmetries in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking advantage of the near-infrared calcium triplet lines, we determine metallicities for a sample of more than 3,500 red giant stars in the field of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find a median metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.05$\pm$0.01 dex with a negative metallicity gradient of -0.064$\pm$0.007 dex deg$^{-1}$ between 1.2\deg~to 6.0\deg consistent with an outside-in evolution scenario. For the first time, we detect hints of a positive metallicity gradient within 1.2\deg, likely reflecting radial migration or centralised chemical enrichment. Azimuthal metallicity asymmetries are detected, with flatter gradients in the eastern and southern quadrants and steeper ones in the north and west. They are consistent with tidal interaction effects from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Finally, in spite of a clear distance and velocity bifurcations in the east, they seem to share a common chemical origin, in agreement with other studies.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: stellar mass growth in massive galaxy clusters from DR5 over the past 7 billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the stellar mass growth in a sample of 568 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters with masses greater than $2.9 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and redshifts in the range $0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8$, drawn from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR5). By utilising deep photometry from the tenth data release of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS DR10), we construct redshift- and cluster mass-binned composite cluster stellar mass functions (SMFs), down to $M_* = 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. This work presents the first analysis of the cluster SMF for this specific cluster sample at this epoch. We find that the characteristic stellar mass ($M^*$) of the cluster SMF evolves marginally from $0.55 \leq z &lt; 0.8$, with most of the measurable growth occurring at $ 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. This suggests that most of the massive galaxy population in clusters ($M_* \gtrsim 10^{10.75} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) is largely established by $z \sim 0.8$, with subsequent evolution driven primarily by late-time assembly processes. The low-mass slope ($\alpha$) of the composite cluster SMF is flat at high-$z$ ($z \sim 0.8$) but steepens at $z &lt; 0.55$, suggesting an abundance of massive galaxies in high-$z$ clusters compared to low-$z$ clusters. Redshift evolution of cluster stellar mass fractions ($f^{\mathrm{cg}}_{*}$) suggest that cluster stellar mass (from galaxies with $M_* &gt; 10^{9.5} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) has grown by a factor of $3.3$ since $z = 0.8$.</description>

      <title>A sensitivity analysis of interstellar ice chemistry in astrochemical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.</description>

      <title>Stellar halos of bright central galaxies II: Scaling relations, colors and metallicity evolution with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and evolution of stellar halos (SHs) around bright central galaxies (BCGs), focusing on their scaling relations, colors, and metallicities across cosmic time, and compare model predictions with ultra--deep imaging data. We use the semianalytic model \textsc{FEGA25}, applied to merger trees from high--resolution dark matter simulations, including an updated treatment of intracluster light (ICL) formation. SHs are defined as the stellar component within the transition radius, linked to halo concentration. Predictions are compared with observations from the VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS) and Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). The SH mass correlates strongly with both BCG and ICL masses, with tighter scatter in the SH--ICL relation. The transition radius peaks at 30--40 kpc nearly independent of redshift, but can reach $\sim400$ kpc in the most massive halos, after z=0.5. SHs and ICL show nearly identical color distributions at all epochs, both reddening toward $z=0$. At $z=2$, SHs and the ICL are $\sim0.4$ dex more metal--poor than BCGs, but the gap shrinks to $\sim0.1$ dex by the present time. Observed colors are consistent with model predictions, while observed metallicities are lower, suggesting a larger contribution from disrupted dwarfs. SHs emerge as transition regions between BCGs and the ICL, dynamically and chemically coupled to both. Their properties depend on halo concentration, ICL formation efficiency, and the progenitor mass spectrum. Upcoming wide--field photometric and spectroscopic surveys (e.g. LSST, WEAVE, 4MOST) will provide crucial tests by mapping structure, metallicity, and kinematics in large galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>CosmoDRAGoN II: Remnant Radio Galaxies in Group and Cluster Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio galaxy remnants are a rare subset of the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGN) population, representing the quiescent phase in the RLAGN lifecycle. Despite their observed scarcity, they offer valuable insights into the AGN duty cycle and feedback processes. Due to the mega-year timescales over which the RLAGN lifecycle takes place, it is impossible to observe the active to remnant transition in real-time. Numerical simulations offer a solution to follow the long-term evolution of RLAGN plasma. In this work, we present the largest suite (to date) of three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations studying the dynamic evolution of the active-to-remnant transition and explore the mechanisms driving cocoon evolution, comparing the results to the expectations of analytic modelling. Our results show key differences between active and remnant sources in both cluster environments and in lower-density group environments. We find that sources in low-density environments can remain overpressured well into the remnant phase. This significantly increases the time for the remnant lobe to transition to a buoyant regime. We compare our results with analytic expectations, showing that the long-term evolution of radio remnants can be well captured for remnants whose expansion is largely pressure-driven if the transition to a coasting phase is assumed to be gradual. We find that remnants of low-powered progenitors can continue to be momentum-driven for about 10 Myr after the jets switch-off. Finally, we consider how the properties of the progenitor influence the mixing of the remnant lobe and confirm the expectation that the remnants of high-powered sources have long-lasting shocks that can continue to heat the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the distribution and redshift dependence of host galaxy dispersion measures using localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic radio pulses whose origins are poorly understood. The dispersion measure of host galaxy (${\rm DM_{host}}$) provides critical insights into the local environment of FRB sources. In this study, we analyze a sample of 117 well-localized FRBs to investigate the statistical properties of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and its potential correlations with host galaxy parameters, including redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and galaxy age. Our results reveal that ${\rm DM_{host}}$ is consistent with a log-normal distribution, with the mean $\mu_{\rm host}=5.03\pm 0.02$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\rm host} = 0.96\pm 0.03$, which corresponds to a median value ${\rm Med}({\rm DM_{host}})=\exp(\mu_{\rm host})=153\pm 3~{\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$. We find a moderate positive correlation between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and redshift, but no statistically significant correlations are found between ${\rm DM_{host}}$ and stellar mass, SFR, or galaxy age. Our findings highlight the importance of ${\rm DM_{host}}$ as a diagnostic tool for unraveling FRB origins, and underscore the need for future FRB surveys with deep multiwavelength host galaxy follow-up.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Hot Molecular Cores are a long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the QUARKS survey sample, focusing on protoclusters where Hot Molecular Cores (HMCs, traced by CH3CN(12--11)) and UC HII regions (traced by H30\alpha/H40\alpha) coexist. Using the high-resolution, high-sensitivity 1.3 mm data from the QUARKS survey, we identify 125 Hot Molecular Fragments (HMFs), which represent the substructures of HMCs at higher resolution. From line integrated intensity maps of CH3CN(12--11) and H30\alpha, we resolve the spatial distribution of HMFs and UC HII regions. By combining with observations of CO outflows and 1.3 mm continuum, we classify HMFs into four types: HMFs associated with jet-like outflow, with wide-angle outflow, with non-detectable outflow, and shell-like HMFs near UC HII regions. This diversity possibly indicates that the hot core could be polymorphic and long-standing phenomenon in the evolution of massive protostars. The separation between HMFs and H30\alpha/H40\alpha emission suggests that sequential high-mass star formation within young protoclusters is not likely related to feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>BALNet: Deep Learning-Based Detection and Measurement of Broad Absorption Lines in Quasar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars serve as critical probes for understanding active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows, black hole accretion, and cosmic evolution. To address the limitations of manual classification in large-scale spectroscopic surveys - where the number of quasar spectra is growing exponentially - we propose BALNet, a deep learning approach consisting of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to automatically detect BAL troughs in quasar spectra. BALNet enables both the identification of BAL quasars and the measurement of their BAL troughs. We construct a simulated dataset for training and testing by combining non-BAL quasar spectra and BAL troughs, both derived from SDSS DR16 observations. Experimental results in the testing set show that: (1) BAL trough detection achieves 83.0% completeness, 90.7% purity, and an F1-score of 86.7%; (2) BAL quasar classification achieves 90.8% completeness and 94.4% purity; (3) the predicted BAL velocities agree closely with simulated ground truth labels, confirming BALNet's robustness and accuracy. When applied to the SDSS DR16 data within the redshift range 1.5&lt;z&lt;5.7, at least one BAL trough is detected in 20.4% of spectra. Notably, more than a quarter of these are newly identified sources with significant absorption, 8.8% correspond to redshifted systems, and some narrow/weak absorption features were missed. BALNet greatly improves the efficiency of large-scale BAL trough detection and enables more effective scientific analysis of quasar spectra.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Distribution of Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters in the Fornax Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial distribution of the Intra-Cluster Globular Clusters (ICGCs) detected in the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster. By separately modeling different components of the observed population of Globular Clusters (GCs), we confirm the existence of an abundant ICGCs over-density with a geometrically complex, elongated morphology roughly centered on the cluster dominant galaxy NGC 1399 and stretching along the E-W direction. We identify several areas in the ICGCs distribution that deviate from a simple elliptical model and feature large density enhancements. These regions are characterized based on their statistical significance, GCs excess number, position, size and location relative to the galaxies in their surroundings. The relations between the spatial distribution and features of the ICGCs structures, mostly populated by blue GCs, and properties of the intra-cluster light and dwarf galaxies detected in the core of the Fornax cluster are described and discussed. The line-of-sight velocity distribution of spectroscopically confirmed GCs within the ICGCs structures is compatible with the systemic velocities of nearby bright galaxies in the Fornax cluster, suggesting that the ICGCs population is at least partially composed of GCs stripped from their hosts. We argue that the findings here presented suggest that, on sub-cluster scales, different mechanisms contribute to the growth of the ICGC. The western region of Fornax is likely associated with old merging events that predate the assembly of the Fornax cluster. The eastern side instead points to a mix of tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies and stripping from the GCSs of massive hosts, more typical of relaxed, high-density cluster environments.</description>

      <title>$\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm Absorption Spectra Classification using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption, an extremely useful tool to study the cold atomic hydrogen gas, can arise either from the intervening galaxies along the line-of-sight towards the background radio source or from the radio source itself. Determining whether $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected as part of large, blind surveys are `intervening' or `associated' using optical spectroscopy would be unfeasible. We therefore investigate a more efficient, machine learning (ML)-based method to classify $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines. Using a sample of 118 known $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines from the literature, we train six ML models (Gaussian naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, SVM and XGBoost) on the spectral parameters obtained by fitting the Busy function to the absorption spectra. We found that a random forest model trained on these spectral parameters gives the most reliable classification results, with an accuracy of 89%, a $F_1$-score of 0.9 and an AUC score of 0.94. We note that the linewidth parameter $w_{20}$ is the most significant spectral parameter that regulates the classification performance of this model. Retraining this random forest model only with this linewidth and the integrated optical depth parameters yields an accuracy of 88%, a $F_1$-score of 0.88 and an AUC score of 0.91. We have applied this retrained random forest model to predict the type of 30 new $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ 21-cm absorption lines detected in recent blind surveys, viz. FLASH, illustrating the potential of the techniques developed in this work for future large $\mbox{H}$ $\mbox{I}$ surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.</description>

      <title>Neutral Atomic Hydrogen in a Star-forming Galaxy 7 Billion Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) constitutes a key phase of the cosmic baryon cycle, bridging the ionised circumgalactic medium and the star-forming molecular gas. Yet, nearly 75 years after its discovery, direct views of HI through its 21cm emission line remain largely confined to the nearby Universe. Indirect measurements and statistical analyses indicate little evolution in the comoving HI density over the past 10 billion years, in stark contrast to the order-of-magnitude decline in the cosmic star-formation rate density over the same epoch. Resolving this tension requires direct HI measurements in individual, representative galaxies at earlier times. Here we report a detection of HI 21cm emission from the Dragon Arc, a gravitationally lensed main-sequence star-forming galaxy at $z=0.725$, observed 6.6 billion years in the past with the MeerKAT radio telescope. The inferred intrinsic HI mass, $M_{\rm HI}=10^{9.66^{+0.16}_{-0.19}}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and velocity width of $205^{+66}_{-48}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ are consistent with expectations from scaling relations for local star-forming galaxies. The resulting HI depletion time of $1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6}\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ is significantly shorter than the $\sim5-10$ Gyr, measured locally for comparable galaxies. This indicates that the galaxy must rapidly replenish its atomic gas reservoir to remain on the star-forming main sequence. This detection demonstrates that strong gravitational lensing, combined with modern cm-wave facilities, can now reveal the HI reservoirs of typical galaxies well beyond the local Universe, opening a new path toward statistical samples that will directly trace the evolution of the cosmic atomic gas supply.</description>

      <title>A Possible "Too-Many-Satellites" Problem in the Isolated Dwarf Galaxy DDO 161</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance of satellite galaxies provides a direct test of $\Lambda$CDM on small scales. While satellites of Milky Way-mass galaxies are well studied, those of dwarf galaxies remain largely unexplored. We present a systematic search for satellites around the isolated dwarf galaxy DDO 161 ($M_\star \approx 10^{8.4}\, M_\odot$) at a distance of 6 Mpc. We identify eight satellite candidates within the projected virial radius and confirm four satellites through surface brightness fluctuation distance measurements from deep Magellan imaging data. With four confirmed satellites above $M_{\star}^{\rm sat} &gt; 10^{5.4}\, M_\odot$, DDO 161 is the most satellite-rich dwarf galaxy known to date. We compare this system with predictions from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, combined with currently established galaxy-halo connection models calibrated on Milky Way satellites, and find that DDO 161 has a satellite abundance far exceeding all current expectations. The rich satellite system of DDO 161 offers new insight into how low-mass galaxies occupy dark matter halos in low-density environments and may provide new constraints on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>PRUSSIC III -- ALMA and NOEMA survey of dense gas in high-redshift star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising the relationship between dense gas and star formation is critical for understanding the assembly of galaxies throughout cosmic history. However, due to the faintness of standard dense-gas tracers - HCN, HCO+, and HNC - dense gas in high-redshift galaxies remains largely unexplored. We present ALMA and NOEMA observations targeting HCN/HCO+/HNC (3-2) and (4-3) emission lines in eleven (mostly) gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at redshift z = 1.6--3.2. We detect at least one line in 10 out of 11 galaxies. Altogether, we detect 34 dense-gas transitions, more than quadrupling the number of extant high-redshift detections. Additionally, in two targets, we detect lower-abundance CO isotopologues 13^CO and C^18O, as well as CN emission. We derive excitation coefficients for HCN, HCO+ and HNC in DSFGs, finding them to be systematically higher than those in nearby luminous infrared galaxies. Assuming a canonical dense-mass conversion factor (alpha_HCN = 10), we find that DSFGs have shorter dense- gas depletion times (median 23 Myr) than nearby galaxies (~60 Myr), with a star-forming efficiency per free-fall time of 1-2%, a factor of a few higher than in local galaxies. We find a wide range of dense-gas fractions, with HCN/CO ratios ranging between 0.01 and 0.15. Finally, we put the first constraints on the redshift evolution of the cosmic dense-gas density, which increases by a factor of 7+/-4 between z = 0 and z = 2.5, consistent with the evolution of the cosmic molecular-gas density.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 Galaxy Luminosity Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present luminosity functions (LFs) in the g, r, z, and W_1 bands from the DESI Year 3 Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), spanning redshifts 0.002&lt;z&lt;0.6. We detail our methodology, including updated k-corrections, evolutionary corrections, and completeness weights. New polynomial k-correction fits based on BGS Y1 supersede those from GAMA DR4. Our LFs reach very faint magnitudes, down to M - 5 log h ~ -10 in r. Independent North and South estimates agree well near the LF knee, with very small statistical errors. These errors reveal that simple analytic forms poorly fit the LFs: the bright end deviates from an exponential, and the faint end shows complex, non-power-law behaviour. We detect an upturn at M - 5 log h &gt; -15, stronger in red galaxies. Below -13, local overdensities and fragmentation of large galaxies amplify this upturn. A systematic offset between North and South appears at the brightest magnitudes, driven by red galaxies. Blue LFs match well across regions, suggesting the discrepancy arises from red galaxy profiles blending into noise in shallower North photometry. This remains inconclusive, so the bright-end offset is treated as a systematic uncertainty. We also present LFs using model Petrosian magnitudes, which are less sensitive to this issue. Splitting by redshift reveals small but significant residuals, indicating our global evolution model, while accurate near the LF knee, misses more complex trends. Using Loveday (2011) redshift limits, we find excellent agreement with GAMA, but with smaller errors. Our methods and results provide a foundation for studying LF dependence on environment, such as local density and cosmic web classification, offering strong constraints on galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A typical nuclear star cluster harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur frequently in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and drive the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of "hit-and-run" collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes and properties. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</description>

      <title>Black Holes at high and low metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the end of their lives the most massive stars collapse into black holes (BHs). The detection of an 85 $M_{\odot}$ BH from GW 190521 appeared to challenge the upper-mass limit imposed by pair-instability (PI). Using systematic MESA calculations with new mass-loss implementations, we show that 100 $M_{\odot}$ stars at metallicities below 0.1 $Z_{\odot}$ can evolve into blue supergiant progenitors with cores small enough to avoid PI, yet with limited envelope loss, yielding remnants within the second mass gap. The key ingredients involve (i) a proper consideration of internal mixing and (ii) physically motivated stellar winds. Our modelling provides a robust pathway that roughly doubles the maximum BH mass permitted by PI theory and establish a physically-consistent framework to explore the upper BH mass limit versus metallicity. For rapid rotation ($\ge$50\% of critical), the upper BH mass comes down to $\simeq$35 $M_{\odot}$, matching the LIGO/Virgo BH mass pile-up.</description>

Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of more than 500 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles over 140 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <title>Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</description>

      <title>Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 -- I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave. Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients, although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.</description>

      <title>The CatWISE2020 Quasar dipole: A Reassessment of the Cosmic Dipole Anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological principle, which asserts a statistically homogeneous and isotropic universe on large scales, is a foundational assumption of the standard cosmological model. A critical test of this principle involves the kinematic interpretation of the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature dipole, conventionally attributed to our peculiar motion relative to the cosmic rest frame. The Ellis-Baldwin test provides a probe of this kinematic interpretation by searching for a matching Doppler-driven dipole in the number counts of extragalactic radio sources. Recent measurements from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog have reported a dipole amplitude significantly exceeding the kinematic expectation, with a claimed significance of $4.9\sigma$. We present a comprehensive reassessment of this test using the same dataset, incorporating major sources of uncertainty in the statistical inference. We use a simulation framework based on the FLASK package, incorporating lognormal realizations of the large-scale structure, the quasar clustering bias, the survey's radial selection function, and its exact sky coverage. Our simulations account for the kinematic dipole, the intrinsic clustering dipole, shot noise, and survey geometry effects. The analysis yields a revised significance of the kinematic dipole excess of $3.63\sigma$ in the absence of a clustering dipole, and $3.44\sigma$ in the presence of a randomly oriented clustering dipole. When the clustering dipole is aligned with the kinematic dipole direction, the significance decreases further to $3.27\sigma$. Our analysis demonstrates that although the anomaly is reduced in significance, it cannot be explained solely as a result of the clustering dipole or mode coupling arising from the survey mask.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of the search for the high-energy neutrino emission associated with blazar flares, accounting for a possible lag of neutrinos with respect to the electromagnetic emission, either due to the slowness of the proton energy losses in $p\gamma$ collisions and/or proton acceleration. We perform two tests, cross-matching neutrinos with energies $E_{\nu} \gtrsim 100$~TeV from the public catalogue of neutrino alerts IceCat-1 with active galactic nuclei from two source samples based on 1) the MOJAVE database and 2) the CGRaBS catalogue, and utilising Fermi-LAT light curves from the public light curve repository. We scan over a wide range of values of the jet-frame time delay $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}}$ between the neutrino arrival and the time of the prior major $\gamma$-ray flare and find a pre-trial $\sim 2\sigma$ correlation at $t^{\prime}_{\mathrm{delay}} \sim 10^{3}$ d, which is consistent ($p_{\mathrm{post-trial}} \sim 0.1$) with expectations under the null hypothesis after trial correction.</description>

      <title>Galaxy assembly bias in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a comparison between SIMBA and IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling of large-scale structure is increasingly concerned with galaxy assembly bias (GAB), the dependence of galaxy clustering on quantities other than halo mass. We investigate how baryonic physics affects the strength and redshift evolution of GAB using the largest runs of two state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA and IllustrisTNG. We quantify GAB by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass-selected galaxies to that of shuffled samples, where galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of similar mass. We find that GAB in both simulations increases from approximately zero at $z=5$ to a $\sim\,5\%$ change in clustering amplitude at $z=2$. After this epoch, the trends diverge: GAB in TNG continues to increase, reaching $\sim\,10\%$ at $z=0$, while in SIMBA it decreases to nearly zero. By further shuffling galaxies within bins of halo mass and cosmic environment -- characterised by smoothed matter overdensity ($\delta_5$) and tidal anisotropy ($\alpha_5$) -- we show that most of the GAB in both simulations can be attributed to the overdensity, while tidal anisotropy contributes negligibly in both simulations. Exploring this effect from the point of view of the halo occupation distribution (HOD), we find that numbers of central and satellite galaxies vary with overdensity -- but only near the respective turn-on masses for these two constituents: the galaxy contents of high-mass haloes are very nearly independent of environment. We present a simple parameterisation that allows the HOD modelling to be modified to reflect this form of density-dependent GAB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse emission of gamma-rays and neutrinos, produced by interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar matter in the Milky Way, provides valuable insights into cosmic ray propagation and Galactic processes. Emission models incorporating different assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion, source distribution, and target gas density are tested using data from neutrino telescopes. In this study, the final all-flavor neutrino dataset, collected over 15 years (2007--2022) by the ANTARES neutrino telescope, is analyzed. A maximum likelihood ratio method built to handle templates of Galactic emission models is employed to evaluate the compatibility of these models with the observed spatial and energy distributions of neutrino events. The results do not yield stringent constraints on the tested models and upper limits on the diffuse neutrino flux are derived, which are compatible with the results obtained by other experiments.</description>

      <title>High CO/H2 ratios supports an exocometary origin for a CO-rich debris disk</title>

Abstract: Over 20 exocometary belts host detectable circumstellar gas, mostly in the form of CO. Two competing theories for its origin have emerged, positing the gas to be primordial or secondary. Primordial gas survives from the belt's parent protoplanetary disk and is therefore H$_2$-rich. Secondary gas is outgassed \textit{in-situ} by exocomets and is relatively H$_2$-poor. Discriminating between these scenarios has not been possible for belts hosting unexpectedly large quantities of CO. We aim to break this gas origin dichotomy \textit{via} direct measurement of H$_2$ column densities in two edge-on CO-rich exocometary belts around $\sim$15 Myr-old A-type stars, constraining the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratio and CO gas lifetimes. Observing edge-on belts enables rovibrational absorption spectroscopy against the stellar background. We present near-IR CRIRES+ spectra of HD 110058 and HD 131488 which provide the first direct probe of H$_2$ gas in CO-rich exocometary belts. We target the H$_2$ (v=1-0 S(0)) line at 2223.3 nm and and the $^{12}$CO $v=2\rightarrow0$ rovibrational lines in the range 2333.8-2335.5 nm and derive constraints on column densities along the line-of-sight to the stars. We strongly detect $^{12}$CO but not H$_2$ in the CRIRES+ spectra. This allows us to place $3\sigma$ lower limits on the $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios of $&gt; 1.35 \times 10^{-3}$ and $&gt; 3.09 \times 10^{-5}$ for HD 110058 and HD 131488 respectively. These constraints demonstrate that at least for HD 110058, the exocometary gas is compositionally distinct and significantly H$_2$-poor, compared to the $&lt;10^{-4}$ $\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{H}_2}$ ratios typical of protoplanetary disks. We also find H$_2$ alone is unlikely to shield CO over the lifetime of the systems. Overall this suggests that the gas in CO-rich belts is most likely not primordial in origin, supporting the presence of exocometary gas.</description>

      <title>The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>Radial Gradients and Intrinsic Scatter in MaNGA Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive stellar population parameters and radial gradients within 0.65 $R_e$ for spatially resolved spectra of 2968 early-type galaxies from MaNGA, spanning stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) of 50--340 km s$^{-1}$. Light-weighted mean age and C, N, Na, Mg, and Fe abundances are obtained by inverting metallicity-composite stellar population models with isochrones that respond in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ to individual element abundance changes.
  Globally, $\log$(age) increases ($\sim$0.53 dex per decade), [Fe/H] declines slightly ($\sim$-0.06 dex per decade), and [X/Fe] for light elements rises (0.19--0.37 dex per decade for $\log\sigma &lt; 2.0$ but steepens to nearly double slope for $\log\sigma &gt; 2.0$) with $\log\sigma$. [Fe/H] peaks at $\log\sigma \sim 2.0$ and falls on either side. Light-element [X/Fe] anticorrelates with [Fe/H] ($\sim$-0.1 dex per decade). Astrophysical scatter is largest in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, especially for Fe and N.
  Internally, age gradients are nearly flat in low-$\sigma$ galaxies and slightly negative in high-$\sigma$ systems ($\sim$-0.04 dex per decade). [Fe/H] radial gradients steepen from -0.06 dex per decade to -0.15 dex per decade across $\sigma$, while light elements (except Na) show $\sim$-0.03 dex per decade gradients. Scatter in gradients peaks in high-$\sigma$ galaxies, most strongly for Fe ($\sim$0.23 dex), suggesting comparable numbers of inside-out and outside-in formation.
  A near-zero ($\sim$-0.03) age and light-element gradient plus mild [Fe/H] gradients supports hierarchical merging for ETG evolution. Simulations match the observed age structure, slope change at $\log\sigma \sim 2.0$, and flat gradients, though they overpredict absolute abundances.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Anisotropic Ultra-long Wavelength Spectra using a Single Antenna on Lunar-orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-long wavelength sky ($\nu\lesssim 30$ MHz) is still largely unexplored, as the electromagnetic wave is heavily absorbed and distorted by the ionosphere on Earth. The far-side of the Moon, either in lunar-orbit or on lunar-surface, is the ideal site for observations in this band, and the upcoming Moon-based interferometers will obtain multi-frequency high-resolution sky maps. Making use of the lunar occultation of the sky and the anisotropy of antenna primary beam response, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the ultra-long wavelength spectral shape in multiple directions in the sky using only one antenna on lunar orbit. We apply the method to one antenna on one of the nine daughter satellites of the proposed Discovering the Sky at Longest wavelength (DSL) project. Using simulated observation data between 1 - 30 MHz from one dipole antenna, we find that the spectra for different regions on the sky can be reconstructed very well and the free-free absorption feature in each region can be derived from the reconstructed spectra. This work demonstrates the feasibility to reconstruct the anisotropic ultra-long wavelength spectra with very limited instrumentation on a lunar-orbit, with mature technologies already in place. It extends the application of such kind of satellite in revealing the distribution of free electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium from the distribution of absorption features in the ultra-long wavelength sky.</description>

      <title>Identifying compact symmetric objects with high-precision VLBI and Gaia astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) trace the earliest phases of radio-galaxy growth; however, robust classification is difficult when radio cores are weak or invisible. We aim to develop and test a Gaia+VLBI approach that utilizes the high-precision optical astrometry of Gaia together with the high-resolution imaging of VLBI to reliably locate the central engine and classify CSOs. We analysed 40 literature CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI maps and by examining spectral index distributions, whole-source variability, and hotspot kinematics over up to 25 years. A source is classified as a CSO when the Gaia centroid lies between two steep-spectrum lobes. Our method yields 20 confirmed CSOs. The confirmed CSOs show low integrated variability, slow hotspot advance speeds, and kinematic ages of 20-2000 yr. High-power CSOs tend to be larger and host faster hotspots, while many low-power systems remain sub-kiloparsec and environmentally confined. Gaia+VLBI registration is a powerful method for CSO classification, especially where radio cores are faint. The observed power-size-velocity-age relations support distinct multiple evolutionary tracks, with high-power CSOs plausibly growing into large radio galaxies, while low-power CSOs appear confined by their host galaxy environments. Taken together, our results indicate that CSO evolution is shaped not only by intrinsic jet power, but also by host-galaxy environment and the duty cycle of the central engine. High-sensitivity observations of low-power CSOs will be crucial to map the full diversity of formation channels and evolutionary pathways of radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Testing compact massive black hole binary candidates through multi-epoch spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emission from two massive black holes (MBHs) bound in a close binary is expected to be modulated by different processes, such as the Doppler boost due to the orbital motion, accretion rate variability generated by the interaction with a circumbinary disc, and binary gravitational self-lensing. When the binary is compact enough, the two black holes are thought to be surrounded by a common broad-line region that reprocesses the impinging periodically varying ionising flux, creating broad emission lines with variable line shapes. Therefore, the study of broad emission line variability through multi-epoch spectroscopic campaigns is of paramount importance for the unambiguous identification of a binary. In this work, we study the response of a disc-like broad-line region to the Doppler-boosted ionising flux emitted by sub-milliparsec MBH binaries on a circular orbit and compare it with the response of a broad-line region illuminated by a single MBH with a periodically but isotropically varying intrinsic luminosity. We show that in the binary case, the time lags of the blue and red wings of the broad emission lines, arising from diametrically opposite sides of the circumbinary disc, are out of phase by half of the binary's orbital period, as they each respond to the periodic "lighthouse" modulation from the binary's continuum emission. This asymmetric time lag represents a new binary signature that cannot be mimicked by a single MBH.</description>

      <title>Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have $&lt;5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($&lt;10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Scatter in the star formation rate-halo mass relation: secondary bias and its impact on line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the impact of secondary bias -- specifically, the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and halo bias at fixed halo mass -- on the line-intensity mapping (LIM) power spectrum. In LIM, the galaxy contributions are flux-weighted, and therefore depend on the luminosity of emission line. We show that the (ensemble-averaged) large-scale two-halo term of the power spectrum depends only on the mean luminosity-halo mass relation if the scatter is uncorrelated with halo bias. However, when luminosity correlates with halo bias at fixed mass, this assumption breaks down. For many emission lines (e.g. H$\alpha$), luminosity is strongly correlated with SFR, making the SFR-weighted power spectrum important to study. In IllustrisTNG, secondary bias increases the two-halo term of the SFR-weighted power spectrum by 5 per cent at $z \sim 1.5$ compared to a model with random scatter. We also find that SFRs of central and satellite galaxies are correlated, enhancing the one-halo term -- which depends on the distribution of SFR inside the halo -- by 10 per cent relative to random pairings. To mitigate secondary bias in the two-halo term, we identify halo concentration (for haloes with mass $\log M_h \lesssim 12$) and satellite mass (for $\log M_h \gtrsim 12$) as effective secondary parameters. These results highlight the need to account for secondary bias when building mock catalogues and interpreting LIM observations.</description>

      <title>Indications of electron-to-proton mass ratio variations in the Galaxy. II. 3 mm methanol lines toward Sgr B2(N) and (M)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential measurements of the fundamental constant mu = m_e/m_p (the electron-to-proton mass ratio) for two sources near the Galactic Center - the Sgr B2(N) and B2(M) molecular clouds - suggest that mu is lower in these clouds than its laboratory value. Based on observations of methanol (CH3OH) emission lines in the 80-112 GHz range (data from the IRAM 30-m telescope), a weighted mean value (Delta mu/mu) = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab = (-2.1 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma) was obtained for Sgr B2(N) at the sample size n = 9. This value of (Delta mu/mu) has the same sign as the result of recent measurements of methanol lines in the higher frequency range of 542-543 GHz (data from the Herschel space telescope) for Sgr B2(N): (Delta mu/mu) = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7) (sample size n = 2).</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies ($&lt;10^8M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Morphology Radio Sources from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS): Radio, Mid-infrared and Environmental Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid morphology radio sources (HyMoRSs) are a rare subclass of radio galaxies that display a Fanaroff-Riley type I (FR I) morphology on one side of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a type II (FR II) morphology on the other. In this study, we report the discovery of thirty-six new HyMoRSs, marking the largest collection of such sources in the southern sky to date, using data obtained from the MeerKAT absorption line survey (MALS). The identified HyMoRSs exhibit moderate radio luminosities in the range $9.9 \times 10^{23}$ to $5.7 \times 10^{25}$ W $Hz^{-1}$, with a median value of $4.4 \times 10^{24}$ W $Hz^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz, and are located within the redshift range $0.04&lt;z&lt;1.34$. In this work, we show for the first time that the two lobes of HyMoRSs exhibit no statistically significant difference in their spectral indices. We also investigate the mid-infrared properties and environments of their host galaxies. Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated near the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that extend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are hosted by actively star-forming galaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates. Furthermore, our findings suggest that HyMoRSs may arise from FR II jets being deflected by a dense, cluster-like environment, along with orientation effects that make one jet appear FR I-like. As our candidates are selected through visual inspection of MALS radio maps, higher-resolution follow-up observations are still necessary to confirm the nature of their morphologies.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a search for megaparsec-scale sources in the NVGRC catalog of candidates of giant radio source (GRS) based on the NVSS sky survey. We visually inspected 370 NVGRC sources, as well as radio sources falling within a neighborhood of about one square degree around the target object. In the studied sample, 48% of objects were classified as giant radio sources, 14% as sources with a projected linear size of less than 0.72 Mpc, and 38\% as physically unrelated objects combined by the recognition algorithm into one radio source. We identified 197 gaints, of which 72 radio sources are known GRGs or GRQs, and 125 sources were identified by us as GRS for the first time. Comparing the proportion of FRI giants in four redshift bins, we found that for z&lt;0.05, the proportions of FRI and FRII sources were approximately equal, but already at z&gt;0.15 the proportion of FRI giants decreases sharply. The predominance of FRII giants in the GRS lists is most likely due to observational selection due to the sensitivity limit of existing radio surveys. Comparing the NVSS and VLASS cutouts, we found that 33% of sources can be classified as fadded. 25% of the sources show a restart of the radio source phase. 38% of the sources have deformed radio lobes. Our GRS sample includes 74% of galaxies, 15% of IR-excess galaxies, which, according to the WISE photometric data, can be attributed to quasars, and 11% of quasars. When visually examining the optical survey cutouts, we noted the presence of close neighbors for the hosts and/or their belonging to known groups or clusters of galaxies. Close neighbors at a distance of less than 50 kpc were found for 39% of radio sources, and 28% of sources are part of groups or clusters of galaxies. Thus, about 70% of gaints are in a fairly dense environment, and this proportion may be higher.</description>

      <title>Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Globular clusters host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures suggest early (3 Myr - 1 Gyr) retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the evolution of gas in young globular clusters, and its implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. We show that low-velocity AGB winds are gravitationally retained in clusters more massive than a few 10^5 MSun. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions agree well with the observed second population fractions in Galactic globular clusters. Furthermore, the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Time-dependent core-halo models indicate that compact objects can grow and collapse within 100 Myr - 1 Gyr, while lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes, including accretion luminosity onto compact objects, novae, pulsar winds, and binary supernovae, will clear the gas by 1 Gyr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</description>

      <title>Scaling Relations of the Dusty Torus with Luminosity and the Broad-Line Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure and compare the size of the dusty torus with active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity and the size of the broad-line region (BLR), using a sample of 182 AGNs with the best H$\beta$ lag measurements. After correcting for accretion-disk contamination, torus sizes are determined from the time lags of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer W1 and W2 band light curves relative to the optical band variability based on the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF) analysis and the Multiple and Inhomogeneous Component Analysis. We find that the torus size from the W1-band (W2-band) tightly correlates with the 5100~\AA\ continuum luminosity with an intrinsic scatter of 0.15-0.16 dex and the best-fit slope of $0.35 \pm 0.03$ ($0.33 \pm 0.03$), which is clearly shallower than the expected 0.5 slope from the sublimation radius-luminosity relation. We find a moderate negative trend that higher Eddington AGNs tend to have smaller torus sizes than expected from the best-fit, suggesting the Eddington ratio plays a role in flattening the torus size-luminosity relation. By comparing the torus size with the H$\beta$ reverberation time lag for a subsample of 67 AGNs, we find that the torus size is a factor of $\sim 10$ and $\sim 14$ larger than the BLR size, respectively for W1 and W2 bands. The torus size based on the W1 (W2) band correlates with the BLR size with the best-fit slope of $1.28 \pm 0.16$ ($1.10 \pm 0.15$), which is comparable but slightly steeper than a linear correlation.</description>

      <title>High resolution mapping of molecular tori with ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution.
  New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc toward the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has a different position angle from previous lower-resolution observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus (axis ratio 6.5 to 10), with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bulge Morphology of Dual AGN Host Galaxies from the GOTHIC survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived s\'ersic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with s\'ersic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop III) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Under our model assumptions, their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop III star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/Cosmic Explorer/Einstein Telescope, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</description>

      <title>Turbulent drag on stellar mass black holes embedded in disks of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how AGN disk turbulence affects the orbital dynamics of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) initially located at a migration trap, focusing on the long-term behavior of eccentricity and inclination in the quasi-embedded regime. We develop a semi-analytical framework in which turbulence is modeled as a stochastic velocity field acting through a modified drag force. We integrate the resulting stochastic differential equations both in Cartesian coordinates and in orbital elements using a linearized perturbative approach, and compare these results with full numerical simulations. Eccentricity and inclination evolve toward steady-state Rayleigh distributions, with variances determined by the local disk properties and the ratio of the gas damping rate to the orbital frequency. The analytical predictions agree well with the numerical simulations. We provide closed-form expressions for the variances in both the fast and slow damping regimes. These results are directly applicable to Monte Carlo population models and can serve as physically motivated initial conditions for hydrodynamical simulations. Turbulent forcing prevents full circularization and alignment of BH orbits in AGN disks, even in the presence of strong gas drag. This has important implications for BH merger and binary formation rates, which are sensitive to the residual eccentricity and inclination. Our results highlight the need to account for turbulence-induced stochastic heating when modeling the dynamical evolution of compact objects in AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform Bertotti-Robinson magnetic field: An exact solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Abundance and Phase-Space Distribution of Subhalos in Cosmological N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</description>

      <title>The first radio view of a type Ibn supernova in SN 2023fyq: Understanding the mass-loss history in the last decade before the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernovae that interact with hydrogen-poor, helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM), known as Type Ibn supernovae (SNe Ibn), present a unique opportunity to probe mass-loss processes in massive stars. In this work, we report the first radio detection of a SN Ibn, SN 2023fyq, and characterize the mass-loss history of its stellar progenitor using the radio and X-ray observations obtained over 18 months post-explosion. We find that the radio emission from 58--185 days is best modeled by synchrotron radiation attenuated by free-free absorption from a CSM of density $\sim$ $10^{-18}$ g/$\rm{cm^{3}}$ ($\sim 10^{6} \mathrm{\rho_{ISM}}$) at a radius of $10^{16}$ cm, corresponding to a mass-loss rate of $\sim$ $4 \times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$ (for a wind velocity of 1700 km/s from optical spectroscopy) from 0.7 to 3 years before the explosion. This timescale is consistent with the time frame over which pre-explosion optical outbursts were observed. However, our late-time observations at 525 days post-explosion yield non-detections, and the 3$\sigma$ upper limits (along with an X-ray non-detection) allow us to infer lower-density CSM at $2\times 10^{16}$ cm with $\rm{\dot{M}}$ $&lt; 2.5\times 10^{-3} \ \mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$. These results suggest a shell-like CSM from at most $4 \times 10^{15}$ to $2 \times 10^{16}$ cm ($\sim 10^{5} R_{\rm{\odot}}$) with an elevated CSM density (0.004 $\mathrm{M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}}$) that is roughly consistent with predictions from a merger model for this object. Future radio observations of a larger sample of SNe Ibn will provide key details on the extent and density of their helium-rich CSM.</description>
