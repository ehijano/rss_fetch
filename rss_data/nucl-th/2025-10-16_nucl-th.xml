      <title>Phenomenology of light baryon resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protons and neutrons are the building blocks of matter, glued together in nuclei by strong interactions. They can be excited by pions, real and virtual photons, neutrinos and other probes. These excitations are referred to as light baryon resonances. A short, pedagogical overview of the field is presented including experimental progress, interpretation of light baryon resonances, and a focus on analysis methods to extract the resonance spectrum from data.</description>

      <title>On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</description>

      <title>New Spallation Background Rejection Techniques to Greatly Improve the Solar Neutrino Sensitivity of JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the potential of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to measure solar neutrinos is known, realizing this potential requires new techniques to reduce detector backgrounds. One of the most serious backgrounds is due to the beta decays of unstable nuclei produced through muon breakup (spallation) of nuclei. This background is much more significant in JUNO compared to Super-Kamiokande due to JUNO's shallower depth and its lack of directional information. We present the first detailed theoretical calculations of spallation backgrounds in JUNO, showing the underlying physical processes and new ways to cut backgrounds while preserving signals. A key point is showing the importance of neutron tagging to identify hadronic showers, which are rare but produce almost all of the dangerous isotopes. With our new techniques, JUNO will be able to reduce deadtime (signal loss) by a factor of five and to reduce the running time needed to meet sensitivity goals by a factor of two. This will give JUNO greatly improved sensitivity to $^8$B and $hep$ solar neutrinos, as we will explore in a separate paper.</description>

      <title>Toward First-Principles Multi-Messenger Predictions: Coupling Nuclear Networks with GR Radiation-MHD in {\tt Gmunu}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of nuclear reaction networks in the \texttt{G}eneral-relativistic \texttt{mu}ltigrid \texttt{nu}merical (\texttt{Gmunu}) code, a framework for general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (GRRMHD). The extended code self-consistently evolves nuclear species coupled to hydrodynamics, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport under the conformal flatness approximation to Einstein's equations. Four approximate nuclear networks are included, with stiff source terms integrated using implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. Validation is performed through benchmarks including conserved-to-primitive recovery with a tabulated stellar equation of state, one-zone silicon burning, and hydrodynamic tests of shock tubes, acoustic pulses, and detonation fronts of Type Ia supernovae. These tests confirm accurate coupling between nuclear reactions and fluid dynamics, conserving electron and nuclear mass fractions to machine precision.
  As an application, we conduct spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova simulations. The models reproduce the expected non-exploding behavior of standard progenitors, while enhanced neutrino heating revives the shock. Including nuclear burning modifies the post-shock composition and dynamics, converting silicon and oxygen layers into iron-group nuclei and strengthening the explosion. This demonstrates the impact of explosive burning on ejecta composition and shock evolution, and establishes the stability of the coupled GR radiation-MHD-nuclear framework. The implementation is fully compatible with multidimensional GRMHD simulations and represents the first GRRMHD code combining M1 neutrino transport with fully coupled nuclear burning.</description>

      <title>Searching for the QCD critical point through constant entropy density contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to locate the QCD critical point by constructing an expansion along contours of constant entropy density. Applying two independent analysis of lattice QCD data at zero baryon chemical potential, we find a critical point at $T_c = 114 \pm 7$ MeV and $\mu_{B_c} = 602 \pm 62$ MeV for an expansion truncated at order $\mu_B^2$. This approach is consistent with recent lattice QCD results up to $\mu_B/T \leq 3$. A more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients from lattice simulations will be essential for reliably establishing the location of the QCD critical endpoint.</description>

      <title>A short review on QCD sum rule studies of P-wave single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, the study of singly heavy baryons has entered a golden era, with numerous excited states observed by experimental collaborations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed to investigate their properties, with the QCD sum rule method being one of the most widely applied. This paper provides a review of these QCD sum rule studies. Over the last ten years, we have systematically studied $P$-wave singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. These $P$-wave singly heavy baryons can explain many excited heavy baryons, including the $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$, $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$, $\Xi_c(2790)^{0/+}$, $\Xi_c(2815)^{0/+}$, $\Sigma_c(2800)^0$, $\Xi_c(2882)^0$, $\Xi_c(2923)^0$, $\Xi_c(2939)^0$, $\Xi_c(2965)^0$, $\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\Omega_c(3090)^0$, $\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\Omega_c(3119)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5912)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5920)^0$, $\Xi_b(6087)^0$, $\Xi_b(6095)^0/\Xi_b(6100)^-$, $\Sigma_b(6097)^\pm$, $\Xi_b(6227)^-$, $\Omega_b(6316)^-$, $\Omega_b(6330)^-$, $\Omega_b(6340)^-$, and $\Omega_b(6350)^-$, etc. Furthermore, we predict additional $P$-wave singly heavy baryons, including two $\Lambda_b$ states, two $\Xi_b$ states, three $\Sigma_b$ states, three $\Xi_b^\prime$ states, two $\Omega_b$ states, two $\Lambda_c$ states, two $\Xi_c$ states, three $\Sigma_c$ states, and one $\Omega_c$ state, all with relatively narrow decay widths, making them viable candidates for experimental observation. The study of singly heavy baryons is closely related to two meaningful questions:"What is the shortest possible lifetime of an observable particle?" and "How can one generally describe approximate (flavor) symmetries?".</description>

      <title>First simultaneous analysis of transverse momentum dependent and collinear parton distributions in the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent (TMD) and collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton. Our study incorporates data from deep-inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan, inclusive weak boson, $W$+\,charm, and jet production involving PDFs, as well as TMD Drell-Yan and $Z$-boson production data from fixed target and collider experiments sensitive to both TMD and collinear distributions. The analysis is performed at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for QCD resummation in TMD observables and next-to-leading order for observables described in collinear factorization. The combined analysis improves knowledge of both TMD and collinear PDFs, particularly in the sea-quark sector, providing a consistent simultaneous description of the aforementioned observables.</description>

      <title>A low-circuit-depth quantum computing approach to the nuclear shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new qubit mapping strategy for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) applied to nuclear shell model calculations, where each Slater determinant (SD) is mapped to a qubit, rather than assigning qubits to individual single-particle states. While this approach may increase the total number of qubits required in some cases, it enables the construction of simpler quantum circuits that are more compatible with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We apply this method to seven nuclei: Four lithium isotopes $^{6-9}$Li from the \textit{p}-shell, $^{18}$F from the \textit{sd}-shell, and two heavier nuclei ($^{210}$Po, and $^{210}$Pb). We run circuits representing their ground states on a noisy simulator (IBM's \textit{FakeFez} backend) and quantum hardware ($ibm\_pittsburgh$). For heavier nuclei, we demonstrate the feasibility of simulating $^{210}$Po and $^{210}$Pb as 22- and 29-qubit systems, respectively. Additionally, we employ Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) via two-qubit gate folding to mitigate errors in both simulated and hardware-executed results. Post-mitigation, the best results show less than 4 \% deviation from shell model predictions across all nuclei studied. This SD-based qubit mapping proves particularly effective for lighter nuclei and two-nucleon systems, offering a promising route for near-term quantum simulations in nuclear physics.</description>

Abstract: The exact wavefunction of an isolated three-body resonance at finite scattering length is obtained for two identical particles interacting with another one via a pairwise zero-range potential. The corresponding universal spectrum is studied as a function of the scattering length. The universality of the results is illustrated by considering a model with finite-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic linear waves and breakdown of the momentum expansion in spin magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate spin magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) by including the magnetic-flux and total angular momentum conservation laws in the hydrodynamic framework. To specify the local angular momentum conservation, we choose the totally antisymmetric spin current. The entropy-current analysis allows for ten dissipative first-order transport coefficients including anisotropic spin relaxation rates and the conversion rate between a vorticity (shear) to a symmetric stress (antisymmetric torque), as well as anisotropic viscosities and resistivities. By employing the linear-mode analysis, we solve the first-order spin MHD equations to determine the dispersion relations with the complete information of anisotropy retained. Our analytic solutions indicate that the small-momentum expansion is spoiled by blow up of the higher-order terms when the angle between the momentum and the magnetic field approaches the right angle. This also reveals the existence of another expansion parameter, and, in light of it, we provide solutions in an alternative series expression beyond the critical angle. We confirm that these two series expansions work well in the appropriate angle ranges as compared with numerical results. Building on our findings regarding the breakdown of the small-momentum expansion in first-order theory, we proceed to discussing how these first-order solutions are modified when we include the relaxation dynamics for dissipative modes with the Israel-Stewart framework. We find that, due to the presence of the critical behavior in the first-order solutions, there remains a diffusive window even after the relaxation dynamics is introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Quantification of Observability and Equation of State of Twin Stars</title>

Abstract: The possibility of discovering twin stars, two neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii, is usually studied in forward modelings by using a restricted number of NS matter equation of state (EOS) encapsulating a first-order phase transition from hadronic to quark matter (QM). Informing our likelihood function with the NS radius data from GW170817 and using a meta-model with 9-parameters capable of mimicking most NS EOSs available in the literature, we conduct a Bayesian quantification of the observability and underlying EOSs of twin stars. Of the accepted EOSs, between 12-18\% yield twin stars, depending on the restrictions we place on the second branch. The possibility of twin stars remains robust even under recent observational constraints. We show that many of these twin star scenarios are observable with currently available levels of accuracy in measuring NS radii. We also present the marginalized posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of every EOS parameter for each of four mass-radius correlation topologies. We find that the inferred EOS depends sensitively on not only whether twin stars are present, but also the category of twin stars, indicating that the observation of twin stars would provide a strong constraint on the underlying EOS. In particular, for two coexisting hybrid stars having QM cores at different densities, the PDF for QM speed of sound squared $c_{\rm qm}^2$ has two peaks, one below and another above the conformal limit $c_{\rm qm}^2=1/3$ predicted by perturbative QCD.</description>
