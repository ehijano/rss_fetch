      <title>The Clustering of Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, $b_{\rm{eff}}$, at $z\sim5$ for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that $b_{\rm{eff}}\sim4.5$, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses $\sim 8\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $\sigma/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming \texttt{JWST} observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.</description>

      <title>Harmony of the Spheres: Extension to All Points of an Algorithm for Producing a Density Field with Given Two-, Three-, and Four-Point Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work (Slepian 2024) showed that the Smith-Zaldarriaga (2011) algorithm to realize Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps with any desired harmonic-space bispectrum could be generalized to produce a 3D density field with any desired N-Point Correlation Functions (NPCFs, N = $2, 3, \ldots$) about a particular, specified set of ``primary'' points. This algorithm assured one of having the correct correlations if measured about these specific centers. Here, we show that this algorithm was more general than initially believed, and can in fact be used to produce a density field on a grid that has the correct, desired NPCFs as measured about \textit{every} point on the grid. This paper should be considered the second in the series, and now completes the quest to generalize the idea of ``constrained realization'' (Hoffman and Ribak 1991) to higher-order statistics. This algorithm will be of great use for quickly generating density fields both to produce covariance matrices, and test systematics, for current and future 3D large-scale structure surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, Spherex, and Roman.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence of a gravitational wave (GW) signal has emerged in pulsar timing array (PTA) data, opening a new window into the nanoHz GW Universe. We explore the physics of GW signals potentially explaining the data, with a primary focus on GW backgrounds (GWBs), considering both astrophysical and cosmological origins. We describe how: (i) An astrophysical nanoHz GWB emerges as the superposition of individual signals from inspiralling massive black-hole binaries (MBHBs); (ii) Environment coupling, eccentricity, and sparse sampling, affect the MBHB signal spectrum and statistical properties, causing great uncertainty in theoretical predictions, but simultaneously offering a handle to discriminate a potential astrophysical origin; (iii) PTA data offers unprecedented opportunities to constrain high-energy physics beyond the standard model, by probing early Universe GWBs, originated during or after inflation; (iv) Different early Universe GWBs, typically created by non-linear and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, can explain the PTA data, as e.g. from inflation scenarios, first order phase transitions, or topological defects; (v) The PTA detection of GWs opens a new window to explore the Universe, with profound implications for astrophysics and particle physics, probing e.g. the equation of state of the early Universe, the origin of the cosmological perturbations, the nature of the dark matter, or whether exotic objects like primordial black holes or cosmic strings exist.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the polarization angle oscillations of the Crab Nebula with the Simons Array and its applications to the search for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for polarization oscillation of the Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, at millimeter wavelengths using observations with the Simons Array, the successor experiment to POLARBEAR. We follow up on previous work by POLARBEAR using 90 GHz band data of the 2023 observing season of the Simons Array to evaluate the variability of Tau A's polarization angle. Tau A is widely used as a polarization angle calibration source in millimeter-wave astronomy, and thus it is necessary to validate the stability. Additionally, an interesting application of the time-resolved polarimetry of Tau A is to search for axion-like particles (ALPs). We do not detect a global signal across the frequencies considered in this analysis and place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A&lt;0.12^{\circ}$ over oscillation frequencies from 3.39 year$^{-1}$ to 1.50 day$^{-1}$. This constrains the ALP-photon coupling at a median 95% upper bound of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}&lt; 3.84\times 10^{-12}\times\left(m_a/10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\right)$ in the mass range from $4.4\times10^{-22}$ to $7.2\times10^{-20}$ eV, assuming the ALP constitutes all of dark matter, its field is a stochastic Gaussian field, and it is the sole source of Tau A's polarization angle oscillation. Additionally, we do not detect signal at the frequencies where 2.5$\sigma$ hints were previously reported by POLARBEAR, but we do not exclude these signals at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Mass Calibration of the ACT DR5 Galaxy Clusters with the DES Year 3 Weak Lensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use weak gravitational lensing measurements from Year 3 Dark Energy Survey data to calibrate the masses of 443 galaxy clusters selected via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 5 maps of the cosmic microwave background. We incorporate redshift and SZ measurements for individual clusters into a hierarchical model for the stacked lensing signals and perform Bayesian analyses to constrain the hydrostatic mass bias of the clusters. Our treatment of systematic uncertainties includes a prescription for measuring and accounting for the weak lensing boost factor, consideration of a miscentering effect, as well as marginalization over uncertainties in the source galaxy photometric redshift distributions and shear calibration. The resultant constraints on the normalization of the mass-observable relation have a precision of approximately 7\%, with the mean WL halo mass of $M_{\rm 500c} = 5.4 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$. We measure the bias between the true cluster mass and the mass estimated from the SZ signal based on an X-ray--calibrated scaling relation assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, to be $1-b = 0.75^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$ over the full sample. When splitting the clusters into high ($z$=0.43-0.70) and low ($z$=0.15-0.43) redshift bins, we measure $1-b = 0.58^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and $0.82^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, respectively. When introducing additional freedom in redshift and mass to the hydrostatic bias model, we find that $1-b$ decreases with redshift (with the power law of $-2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$, 99.95\% confidence), consistent with findings from other recent studies, while we do not find any significant trend in mass. We also demonstrate that our result is robust against various systematics. The weak-lensing mass calibration presented in this study will be a useful tool for using the ACT clusters as probes of astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>$\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM: A promising natural extension of the standard model of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and introduces two additional, observationally testable contributions to the dark energy sector, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, alongside the cosmological constant. Using Planck CMB and DESI BAO data, we find that this framework is suitable for relaxing the Hubble tension. The Planck CMB data alone allow substantial freedom in late-time dynamics, yielding $H_0 = 75.4^{+3.9}_{-2.3}\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$, fully consistent with distance-ladder measurements from the SH0ES collaboration. When DESI BAO data are included in the analysis, the late-time expansion history becomes more tightly anchored, reducing the $H_0$ discrepancy to $\sim 2.5\sigma$ level. This highlights the limited constraining power of currently available low-redshift data measurements, especially in the context of the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, where dynamical dark energy dominates the background expansion over a relatively large redshift range. The model naturally exhibits a smooth quintessence--phantom transition followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior of the dark energy equation of state, alters late-time cosmic dynamics, and preserves standard early-universe physics. Overall, our results demonstrate that controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM can improve cosmological concordance.</description>

      <title>DESI DR2 Constraints on the $R_h=ct$ Universe: Model Viability and Comparison with $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a comparative analysis of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and the alternative $R_h=ct$ framework using recent observational data from cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernova, and baryon acoustic oscillations. The study evaluates the ability of each model to reproduce the observed expansion history of the Universe through a joint statistical assessment based on the chi-squared statistics, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), and Bayes factor. While both models yield acceptable fits, $\Lambda$CDM consistently attains lower information-criterion values and higher likelihood, indicating a superior overall performance. An examination of the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ shows that $\Lambda$CDM naturally captures the transition from early-time deceleration to late-time acceleration, where as $R_h=ct$ predicts a strictly linear expansion. We also estimate the age of the Universe within both models, finding that $\Lambda$CDM prediction agrees with the Planck 2018 result, while the linear expansion in $R_h=ct$ leads to an older cosmic age. Recent JWST observations of unexpectedly mature high-redshift galaxies have reopened the discussion regarding whether the Universe may be older than implied by the standard model; although these results remain under active investigation, they underscore that fully resolving cosmic evolution may require refinements beyond the concordance paradigm.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Dark Sector: Understanding Modified Gravity Signatures with Cross-Correlations of Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synergy between large-scale structure (LSS) observations and gravitational wave (GW) events for testing modified gravity. In particular, we forecast the LSS $\times$ GW cross-correlation signal using Stage-IV LSS surveys, such as Euclid, in combination with future detections from the Einstein Telescope. This cross-correlation provides a novel probe of fundamental physics, potentially revealing deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm that may not be accessible through electromagnetic observations alone. We describe the considered modified gravity scenarios, the relevant LSS and GW observables, and the synthetic forecast methodology. Our results demonstrate that combining LSS and GWs can significantly enhance constraints on departures from General Relativity, opening a new window for multi-messenger cosmology. We further assess the observational requirements GW experiments must meet to improve upon constraints obtainable from LSS alone.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of clusters of galaxies in the presence of dark energy: Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that, owing to the interaction of baryonic matter with the carrier of dark energy, all configurations of baryonic matter acquire energy and inevitably must expand. This conclusion applies to all hierarchical levels of the baryonic universe, including galaxy clusters. We propose a simple statistical method for identifying possible radial motions of galaxies within clusters. To illustrate this method, we examined the structural features of the Virgo galaxy cluster and identified its substructure, comprising groups of galaxies of varying multiplicity. Galaxies in the substructure are somewhat brighter than those in the overall cluster, and each subgroup contains an active galaxy. Subgroups are considered to be the product of primordial ejections of matter from the central generator galaxy. It is shown that the average stellar magnitude of galaxies in subgroups positively correlates with their average velocity. This correlation can be interpreted as evidence of cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2255. II. Properties of filaments using multi-frequency radio data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to further analyze the filaments in Abell 2255 combining LOFAR data with uGMRT (1260 MHz) and VLA (1520 MHz) data to constrain the spectral shape of the filaments. This allows studying their morphological properties, required to understand their origin, at unprecedentedly high resolution (~2.3 kpc), crucial to disentangle the different cosmic ray components that populate the Original TRG. We produced a LOFAR-VLBI map at 1.5" resolution using the wide-field technique with 56 hours of observations. This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($\alpha &gt; 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\%$. Although there is no clear scenario regarding the formation of filaments, we highlight the importance of the Original TRG as the main driver of such structures, even at larger distances from the core.</description>

      <title>Low-redshift 3D Lyman-{\alpha} Forest Correlations with China Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest traces the large-scale matter distribution over a wide range of redshift, its three-dimensional (3D) clustering at $z &lt; 2$ has not yet been measured. We investigate the prospects for measuring low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ correlations with the UV slitless spectroscopic instrument of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). We construct mock CSST quasar spectra that reproduce the expected survey depth, spectral resolution and noise properties, and derive Ly$\alpha$ auto-correlation functions and cross-correlations with quasars (QSO) and emission-line galaxies (ELG) in the range $1.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.0$. We then interpret these three-dimensional correlation functions with a standard anisotropic redshift-space clustering model and obtain forecast constraints on the Ly$\alpha$ and tracer parameters. At an effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=1.59$ (1.58 for ELGs), the Ly$\alpha$ bias parameters will be measured with a 10-30\% precision, depending on priors on other tracer's biases. We also forecast a marginal $2.5\sigma$ ($3.7\sigma$) detection of the BAO feature, corresponding to a $\sim$10\% (7\%) constraint on the isotropic BAO scale, from the combination of Ly$\alpha$ auto- and Ly$\alpha$-QSO (ELG) cross-correlations. These results show that CSST can provide the first three-dimensional characterization of the low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest and a complementary Ly$\alpha$-based BAO measurement at $z &lt; 2$, helping to link galaxy clustering surveys with high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ forest studies.</description>

      <title>Do low-redshift observations open the doors to an open universe?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of a significant deviation from a zero curvature would have profound consequences for inflationary theories and fundamental physics. Relative to high-redshift Planck's CMB measurements, indicating a $\sim 2\sigma$ evidence for a closed universe, low-redshift observations of BAO and SN Ia have the advantages of weak dependence on early universe physics, independently observational systematics, and strong redshift dependence of distances in constraining the cosmic curvature. Using the integrated observations from DESI BAO and SN Ia, we find an unexpected $2\sigma$ evidence for an open universe, regardless of the SN Ia sample employed. When considering DESI, SN Ia and the acoustic scale $\theta_\star$ data, the preference for an open universe exceeds the $3\sigma$ level, reaching $5\sigma$ for the case of DESY5 Supernovae data. Therefore, low-redshift observations favor an open universe, and this preference persists even when alternative high-redshift priors are adopted. Our results point to the existence of an additional tension between high- and low-redshift observations, present also in non-flat models beyond the minimal $\Lambda$CDM scheme, thereby challenging the standard inflationary predictions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Primordial $B$-mode Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for primordial gravitational waves is a central goal of cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Isolating the characteristic $B$-mode polarization signal sourced by primordial gravitational waves is challenging for several reasons: the amplitude of the signal is inherently small; astrophysical foregrounds produce $B$-mode polarization contaminating the signal; and secondary $B$-mode polarization fluctuations are produced via the conversion of $E$ modes. Current and future low-noise, multi-frequency observations enable sufficient precision to address the first two of these challenges such that secondary $B$ modes will become the bottleneck for improved constraints on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. The dominant source of secondary $B$-mode polarization is gravitational lensing by large scale structure. Various strategies have been developed to estimate the lensing deflection and to reverse its effects the CMB, thus reducing confusion from lensing $B$ modes in the search for primordial gravitational waves. However, a few complications remain. First, there may be additional sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, for example from patchy reionization or from cosmic polarization rotation. Second, the statistics of delensed CMB maps can become complicated and non-Gaussian, especially when advanced lensing reconstruction techniques are applied. We previously demonstrated how a deep learning network, ResUNet-CMB, can provide nearly optimal simultaneous estimates of multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization. In this paper, we show how deep learning can be applied to estimate and remove multiple sources of secondary $B$-mode polarization, and we further show how this technique can be used in a likelihood analysis to produce nearly optimal, unbiased estimates of the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Non-local-in-time structure formation and sixth-order galaxy bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of the non-local-in-time galaxy bias expansion in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure. In order to fully capture time non-locality up to sixth order, we must take into account that every field can contribute non-locally from a separate time in the past. Starting from the general non-local-in-time expression for the galaxy overdensity, we explicitly compute the complete sixth-order basis of bias operators at leading order in spatial derivatives, finding 57 independent biases, compared to 46 in the corresponding local-in-time expansion. As previously found at fifth order, this difference implies that higher-order clustering statistics can distinguish between local- and non-local-in-time galaxy formation, and thus are sensitive, at a single redshift, to the formation time of galaxies. Along the way, we obtain recursion relations for the perturbative kernels and show that they satisfy specific multi-leg soft limits when the sum of a subset of the external momenta goes to zero.</description>

      <title>InterACTing dark radiation models after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we assess the implications of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 measurements for two interacting dark radiation scenarios previously shown to mitigate the Hubble tension. The first model, Wess-Zumino dark radiation (WZDR), features a mass threshold in the dark sector that induces a step-like reduction in the dark radiation abundance as the dark temperature evolves. The second model, new atomic dark matter (nuADaM), introduces dark radiation that remains coupled to a subcomponent of dark matter until shortly before matter-radiation equality. Earlier analyses using Planck data demonstrated that these interactions significantly relax constraints on the dark radiation density and allow values of $H_0$ consistent with local distance-ladder determinations. Incorporating ACT DR6, which extends CMB measurements deep into the high-$\ell$ damping tail, we find that constraints on the additional radiation component tighten substantially in both scenarios, closing most of the parameter space that previously enabled higher values of $H_0$. We further analyze a generalized model including both free-streaming and self-interacting dark radiation, and show that the resulting constraints are consistent with ACT's findings for the limiting cases of purely free-streaming or purely self-interacting radiation. Overall, ACT DR6 significantly restricts interacting dark radiation as a solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A cosmologist's take on Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift sources, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), which may host supermassive black holes (BHs) significantly heavier than their stellar content compared with local scaling relations. These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $\mu$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.</description>

      <title>Are Primordial Black Holes Truly Fine-Tuned?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-field inflationary models which generate primordial black holes through the enhancement of the curvature primordial power at small scales are commonly criticized and frequently dismissed because they require a large amount of fine-tuning in the parameters setting the ultra slow-roll phase. However, the standarly adopted definition of fine-tuning has a clear drawback: the more the primordial black hole abundance is small and cosmologically harmless, the larger the parameter space is fine-tuned. A reliable measure of fine-tuning should deliver a large value when the primordial black hole abundance is fine-tuned and at the same time reduce to something close to unity when it encounters typical sensitivity. Motivated by such arguments, we use the (modified version of) Wilson's naturalness criterion for quantifying the fine-tuning and naturalness and we show that the primordial black hole models are not technically unnatural.</description>

      <title>Effects of helium sedimentation on late star formation in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how helium sedimentation in galaxy clusters can affect the history of star formation in the central cluster galaxy. As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{14} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\rm sun} \lesssim M_{\rm halo} \lesssim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions. For clusters with a halo mass $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{15} M_{\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects can potentially be very important and renew star formation activity in the central galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Correlation Between Black Hole Mass and Dark Matter Halo Concentration in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a positive correlation between supermassive black hole mass and dark matter halo concentration at fixed halo mass in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Analyzing central galaxies in TNG100 (N = 18,954), EAGLE (N = 1,522), and CAMELS-TNG (N = 6,664), we find partial correlation coefficients of r = +0.24, +0.34, and +0.66 respectively, all highly significant (p &lt; 10^-10). The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) &lt; 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Formalism for Simulating Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is plausible that the dark matter particles have non-gravitational interactions among themselves. If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Luminosity-dependent Continuum Lag in NGC 4151 from Photometric and Spectroscopic Continuum Reverberation Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and drives feedback that shapes galaxy evolution. Constraining AGN accretion disk structure is therefore essential for understanding black hole growth and feedback processes. However, direct constraints on disk size remain rare -- particularly from long-term, multi-season spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM), which is critical for isolating the intrinsic disk response from the broad-line region (BLR). We present results from an intensive multi-wavelength RM campaign of NGC 4151 during its brightest state in nearly two decades. This represents the third high-cadence monitoring over the past decade, capturing accretion states spanning the transitional regime between thin and thick disks, making NGC 4151 the only AGN with continuum RM observations across such a wide range in accretion states. Combining spectroscopy from the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope with coordinated Swift UV/X-ray monitoring, we measure inter-band continuum lags from UV to optical. The wavelength-dependent lags follow a tight $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation, consistent with reprocessing in a thin disk, but exceed theoretical predictions by a factor of 6.6. Our lag spectrum reveals clear excesses near the Balmer and possibly Paschen jumps, confirming diffuse continuum (DC) contamination from the BLR. By comparing the three campaigns, we discover a non-monotonic lag-luminosity trend ($&gt;3\sigma$), which cannot be explained by DC emission alone. We propose the lags reflect combined disk and BLR contributions, and present the first evidence that the DC component follows an intrinsic Baldwin effect. These results offer new insights into SMBH mass measurements and theoretical models of AGN inner structure.</description>

      <title>Measurements of quasar proximity zones with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of DESI Y1 quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) around quasars is shaped by their dense environments and by their excess ionizing radiation, forming a "quasar proximity zone" whose size and anisotropy depend on the quasar's halo mass, luminosity, age, and radiation geometry. Using over 10,000 quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 data, with projected comoving separations $r_{\perp} &lt; 2\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, we investigate how the proximity zone of foreground quasars at $z\sim2{\rm-}3.5$ affects Lyman-alpha absorption in their background quasars. The large DESI sample enables unprecedented precision in measuring this "transverse proximity" effect, allowing a detailed investigation of the signal's dependence on the projected separation of quasar pairs and the luminosity of the foreground quasar. We find that enhanced gas clustering near quasars dominates over their ionizing effect, leading to stronger absorption on neighboring sightlines. Under the assumption that quasar ionizing luminosity is isotropic and steady, we infer the IGM overdensity profile in the vicinity of quasars, finding overdensities as high as $\Delta \sim 10$ at comoving distance $\sim 1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ from the most luminous systems. Surprisingly, however, we find no significant dependence of the proximity profile on the luminosity of the foreground quasar. This lack of luminosity dependence could reflect a cancellation between higher ionizing flux and higher gas overdensity, or it could indicate that quasar emission is highly time variable or anisotropic, so that the observed luminosity does not trace the ionizing flux on nearby sightlines.</description>

      <title>Standard Sirens in 2040s: Probing the Cosmic Expansion History with Gravitational Waves and Spectroscopic Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences have matured into a robust cosmological probe, providing self-calibrated luminosity distance measurements independent of any cosmic distance ladder, hence the term "standard sirens". The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy. Forecasts show that photometric uncertainties degrade cosmological constraints by up to an order of magnitude compared to spectroscopic ones. Wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities will therefore be an essential infrastructure for GW cosmology in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for MaNGA Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scalar-mediated Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) model to address small-scale structure anomalies such as the core-cusp and diversity problems. The model is composed by a leptophilic scalar mediator and a pseudo-Dirac dark matter candidate with a mass splitting of 100 eV.We imposed aA dark discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry forbids tree-level elastic scattering. Therefore creates kinematic threshold that suppresses scattering in ultra-faint satellite galaxies while enabling large self-interaction cross-sections in dwarf galaxies via resonant enhancement. To satisfy Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requirements, we introduce a dimension-5 magnetic dipole operator that enable the decay of the excited state ($\chi_2 \rightarrow \chi_1 \gamma$). This operator also provides a unique, low-threshold signal for direct detection experiments, characterized by a distinct $1/E_R$ recoil spectrum. We identify a benchmark parameter space around ($m_\chi \approx 40$ GeV, $m_\phi \approx 20$ MeV) where non-perturbative coupled-channel dynamics successfully reconcile astrophysical observations with cosmological bounds, including CMB constraints on annihilation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Massive Spin-2 Particles During Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the minimal gravitational portal for a massive spin-2 dark matter candidate $X_{\mu\nu}$ produced during perturbative reheating. The dark sector couples to the visible sector only via gravity, and we analyze two unavoidable channels: (i) inflaton condensate annihilation, $\phi+\phi \to X+X$, and (ii) thermal scatterings, ${\rm SM}+{\rm SM}\to X+X$, both mediated by graviton exchange. Working in the Fierz-Pauli framework for a free massive spin-2 field of mass $m_2$, we derive the graviton-mediated amplitudes and perform a full helicity decomposition of the final state. The relic abundance is obtained analytically in terms of $m_2$ and the reheating temperature $T_{\rm RH}$. In the light mass regime $m_2 \ll m_\phi$ (with $m_\phi$ the inflaton mass during oscillations), production is overwhelmingly dominated by the longitudinal (helicity-0) mode: the $2\to2$ cross section is parametrically enhanced, scaling as $\sim (m_\phi/m_2)^4$, and yields efficient dark matter production despite purely gravitational couplings. Compared to lower-spin cases (spin-$0$, $1/2$, $1$, and $3/2$), massive spin-$2$ production is substantially more efficient for the same reheating history. Over most of the parameter space the inflaton condensate channel dominates the yield, while the thermal contribution is negligible. Avoiding overproduction typically requires either a relatively low $T_{\rm RH}$ or a spin-$2$ mass near threshold, $m_2 \lesssim m_\phi$. This places the spin-$2$ portal on similar footing to other higher spins in reheating scenarios, while emphasizing the central role of the helicity-$0$ mode and the reheating history in setting the dark matter density.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Upper Bound on Micro-lensing Signature of the Highest Mass Binary Black Hole Event GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) event, GW231123, is the highest mass binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \texttt{$\mu$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models.</description>

      <title>GW231123: A Case for Binary Microlensing in a Strong Lensing Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unusual properties of GW231123, including component masses within the pair-instability mass gap ($137^{+22}_{-17}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at 90\% credible intervals) and extremely large spins near the Kerr limit, have challenged standard formation scenarios. While gravitational lensing has been proposed as an explanation, current millilensing studies suggest the signal consists of three overlapping images, a configuration that exceeds the predictions of the isolated point-mass lens model. In this work, we investigate a binary lens model embedded within a strong lensing galaxy. This is the simplest model that not only naturally produces the observed number of images but also aligns with the fact that microlensing objects usually reside in galaxies. To overcome the high computational cost of the diffraction integral required for wave optics, we constructed a Transformer-based neural network that accurately generates lensing waveforms within milliseconds per waveform. Using the NRSur7dq4 waveform model, we find primary and secondary lens masses of $714^{+239}_{-309} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $87^{+139}_{-73} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, respectively. We also find a strong lensing magnification of $5.56^{+2.78}_{-1.98}$ (at 90\% credible intervals) and a Bayes factor of $\log_{10}B^\mathrm{Binary}_\mathrm{Single}\simeq1.34$. This result underscores the necessity of considering multi-body and environmental effects in microlensing studies. More crucially, under this embedded binary lens interpretation, the inferred source-frame binary black hole masses ($80.0^{+21.3}_{-14.4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $62.0^{+19.8}_{-29.4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and spins ($0.37^{+0.51}_{-0.33}$ and $0.40^{+0.52}_{-0.35}$) shift to values consistent with the current population constrained from O1--O3.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high precision high voltage system for PTOLEMY</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $\beta$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $\beta$-spectrum endpoint of \SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \SI{0.2}{ppm} per \SI{1}{kV} single board and $\lesssim$ \SI{50}{mV} over the \SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \SI{0.05}{ppm} over \SI{20}{kV}.</description>

Abstract: The GWTC-4.0 catalog of transient gravitational wave signals describes observations made in the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave detector network. Here we extend the LVK's GWTC-4.0 analysis to elliptic orbits, and an improved description of spin precession in the frequency domain. For this study we use state-of-the-art waveforms from the IMRPhenom family (specifically XPNR, TPHM, and TEHM), and we consider the 84 confidently detected events that are consistent with binary-black-hole mergers. We present an extended catalog of updated posterior samples, quantify how incorporation of these waveform effects alters inferred source properties relative to previous analyses, and discuss waveform systematics.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Sectors with Exploding Black Holes: Gamma Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking radiation from the explosion of a black hole would provide definitive information on the particle spectrum of nature. Here we quantify the potential of current and future gamma ray telescopes to probe new dark sectors. We improve on the analysis used in previous work by making careful use of the experimental response functions, deriving a more realistic estimate of the backgrounds and optimizing the statistical analysis. We compute the sensitivity of the current experiments (HAWC and LHAASO) and estimate the reach of the future experiments (SWGO and CTA North and South), for various sky positions of the explosion. We find that for a black hole exploding at $0.01\,\text{pc}$ the gamma ray signal observed by HAWC could probe dark sectors with 10-20 (or more) new Dirac fermions up to masses around $10^5\,\text{GeV}$, while CTA will be able to probe 2-15 new Dirac fermions with masses up to $10^6\,\text{GeV}$. CTA North and South will have sensitivity to 10 dark fermions up to a distance of 0.1 pc and 50 up to a distance of 0.6 pc.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A Measurement of the DR6 CMB Lensing Power Spectrum and its Implications for Structure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing over $9400$ sq. deg. of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB dataset, which consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations. We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at $2.3\%$ precision ($43\sigma$ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure our results are robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. The baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.013\pm0.023$ relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.005\pm0.023$ relative to the $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ best-fit model. From our lensing power spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \left({\Omega_m}/{0.3}\right)^{0.25}$ of $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.818\pm0.022$ from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and $S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.813\pm0.018$ when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with $\Lambda$CDM model constraints from Planck or $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ CMB power spectrum measurements. Our lensing measurements from redshifts $z\sim0.5$--$5$ are thus fully consistent with $\Lambda$CDM structure growth predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily $z\sim1100$. We find no evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low redshifts</description>

      <title>Hint of dark matter-dark energy interaction in DESI DR2 and current cosmological dataset?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new constraints on an interacting dark matter-dark energy scenario motivated by string compactification, where a scalar field adiabatically tracks the minimum of an effective potential sourced by dark matter density. In this study, we focus on the Chameleon dark energy model and numerically solve the Klein-Gordon equation using a shooting algorithm to determine precise initial conditions such that the field rests at effective potential minima today. We perform a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using a combination of datasets, including Planck, BAO (SDSS and DESI DR2), Pantheon+, and SH$_0$ES. Our analysis shows a mild preference for a higher non-zero dark sector coupling, compared to earlier works on similar models, for two particular combinations of datasets: (i) Planck + DESI DR2 BAO +.Pantheon+, (ii) Planck + SDSS BAO + Pantheon+ + SH$0$ES. Notably, the inclusion of DESI DR2 and SH$0$ES data increases the inferred interaction strength to $\beta \sim 0.3$ (68\% C.L.) and yields weak and positive evidence in favor of the model over $\Lambda$CDM, with $\Delta\chi^2_{\rm min} = -4.75, -6.41$ and $\Delta$AIC= $-0.75, -2.41$ respectively. This model remains consistent with a phantom crossing at redshift $z\sim 0.5$, in agreement with the trend indicated by DESI observations. However, due to the settlement of the scalar field at the minima of the effective potential at the present epoch, the effective dark energy equation of state asymptotically approaches $w_{\rm eff}\to -1$. leading to only weak evidence in favor of this model when analyzed using the DESI DR2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Time Non-locality in Dark Matter and LSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the intriguing phenomenon of time non-locality in the evolution of dark matter and Large Scale Structure (LSS). Recently in\,\cite{Donath:2023sav}, it was shown that time non-locality emerges in bias tracer fluctuations, which are $SO(3)$ scalars in real space, at fifth order in the perturbation expansion in dark matter overdensity. We demonstrate that by breaking the symmetry down to $SO(2)$, which is the case whenever line-of-sight effects become important, such as for flux fluctuations in the Lyman $\alpha$ forest, the temporal non-locality appears at the third order in expansion. Additionally, within the framework of EFTofLSS, we demonstrate that time non-locality manifests in the effective stress tensor of dark matter, which is a second rank tensor under $SO(3)$ transformations, again at the third order in dark matter overdensity. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of the standard $\Pi$ basis\,\cite{Mirbabayi:2014zca} in handling time non-local operators.</description>

      <title>Modeling and measuring the anisotropic halo 3-point correlation function: a coordinated study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing and future spectroscopic galaxy surveys will cover unprecedented volumes with a number of objects large enough to effectively probe clustering anisotropies through higher-order statistics. In this work, we present a novel and efficient implementation of both a model for the multipole moments of the anisotropic 3-point correlation function (3PCF) and of their estimator. To evaluate the performance of our model, we compared its predictions against direct 3PCF measurements obtained with our estimator from a set of 298 dark matter halo catalogs drawn from the $z=1$ snapshots of $N$-body simulations. For the statistical analysis, we employed a covariance matrix estimated from an independent suite of 3000 mock halo catalogs at the same redshift. We then repeated the analysis by combining the 2-point correlation function (2PCF) to the 3PCF, with and without including its anisotropic part. In the 3PCF-only analysis, the addition of the anisotropic component of the 3PCF effectively breaks the degeneracy between the growth rate $f$ and the linear bias $b_1$, significantly reducing their uncertainties. It also significantly improves the precision of the Alcock-Paczynski parameter $\varepsilon$ but does not reduce the $\sim 1$% offset we find in the estimate of the isotropic dilation parameter $\alpha$. The joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis reduces, though does not fully remove, biases in the AP and isotropic dilation parameters and breaks the $f$-$b_1$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy, leading to tighter constraints overall. The anisotropic 3PCF adds little to the joint analysis because the tree-level 3PCF model fails to capture the anisotropic information primarily encoded on small scales and in squeezed triangle configurations. A more advanced model will be required to exploit this information fully.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial black hole abundance with Insight-HXMT</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a major candidate for dark matter and they have been extensively constrained across most mass ranges. However, PBHs in the mass range of $10^{17}$ - $10^{21}$ g remain a viable explanation for all dark matter. In this work, we use observational data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) to refine constraints on PBHs within the mass range of $2\times10^{16}$ - $5\times10^{17}$ g. Our analysis explores three scenarios: directly using observational data, incorporating the astrophysical background model (ABM), and employing the power-law spectrum with an exponential cutoff. Our results indicate that although Insight-HXMT does not have an advantage in the first two scenarios, when considering the power-law model, its exceptional sensitivity in the hard X-ray regime and sufficiently high upper energy limit significantly strengthen the constraints on PBHs with masses greater than $10^{17}$ g compared to previous limits. Furthermore, the exclusion limit for PBHs as dark matter has reached $4\times10^{17}$ g, which is comparable to the current threshold.</description>

Abstract: The question of whether the massive sterile neutrinos exist remains a crucial unresolved issue in both particle physics and cosmology. We explore the cosmological constraints on the massive sterile neutrinos using the latest observational data, including the baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck satellite and ACT, and the 5-year Type Ia supernova data and the 3-year weak-lensing data from DES. We search for the massive sterile neutrinos within the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our analysis shows that when considering massive sterile neutrinos within the $w_0w_a\rm CDM$ model, the combined datasets allow us to infer a non-zero sterile neutrino mass at approximately $2\sigma$ confidence level. Specifically, in the $w_0w_a$CDM+Sterile model, the effective mass of sterile neutrinos and the effective number of relativistic species are constrained to be $m_{\nu,\ \mathrm{sterile}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = 0.50^{+0.33}_{-0.27} \, \mathrm{eV}$ and $N_\mathrm{eff} = 3.076^{+0.011}_{-0.017}$, respectively. However, the $\Lambda$CDM+Sterile and $w$CDM+Sterile models could not provide evidence supporting the existence of massive sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Multi-copy Axion Transfer Function and Observational Implications of Effective de Broglie Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-light axions are viable fuzzy/wave-like dark matter ($\psi $DM) candidates generically predicted by the String Axiverse paradigm with multiple particle copies, whereas most of the discussions/constraints on $\psi $DM from astronomical observations to date are based on the assumption of a single particle copy. Here, we aim to complete this gap by exploring the generic multi-axion scenario motivated in the String Axiverse context, and investigate its astronomical implications in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. In the linear regime, with linear density perturbation analysis, we provide a simplified prescription for obtaining multi-copy axion transfer functions and also identify an "equivalence" among all axion copies owing to the mutual coupling to the gravitational potential. As a result of this 'equivalence', we argue the suppression to LSS is governed by an effective mass $m_{eff}^{-2}=\sum_i w_i m_i^{-2}$, with $\{ w_i\}$ being fractional contributions of different copies to the full cosmic dark matter density. In non-linear regime within galaxy halos, we show that similar notions of effective mass, with expressions provided, to govern the collective wave interference and hence determine the net stellar heating rates and the substructure-induced spread of JWST transients near critical curves. Distinctive to the multi-copy scenario, the effective mass within galaxy halos is generically anticipated to be radially decreasing following the stronger concentration of heavier copies to the galactic center. Such a spatial variation leads to radially increasing spreading scales for micro-lensed transients at different radial positions, a signature that may be tested with future JWST lensing observations.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark energy after DESI DR2: a challenge for $\Lambda$CDM paradigm?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck 2018, data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and finally various Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) datasets (PantheonPlus, Union3 and DESY5). For the basic and simplest interacting model we find a mild preference of the interaction at slightly more than $1\sigma$ however still within $2\sigma$, and thus no strong evidence of interaction is found. However, comparison with $\Lambda$CDM scenario through $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}$, AIC and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture, namely according to $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min}$ the interaction is mildly favored by most of the datasets, while the remaining statistical measures are inclined toward $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data requires reliable likelihood modeling, particularly at large angular scales where angular power spectrum estimators exhibit non-Gaussian statistics. We present a novel approach, based on the Hamimeche-Lewis formalism, that marginalizes over auto-spectra, thus reducing residual biases from noise misestimation and partial sky coverage. We validate our approach by simulating three independent CMB channels, or data splits, in a multi-field setting, comparing to the pixel-based likelihood ground truth estimates for the optical depth $\tau$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We benchmark our method against the main power spectrum based alternatives available in the literature, showing that it outperforms all of them in terms of accuracy, while remaining fast and computationally efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03023v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from 8 strongly lensed quasars (hereafter, the TDCOSMO-2025 sample). Building on previous work, our analysis incorporated new deflector stellar velocity dispersions measured from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Keck Telescopes, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), utilizing improved methods. We used integrated JWST stellar kinematics for 5 lenses, VLT-MUSE for 2, and resolved kinematics from Keck and JWST for RXJ1131-1231. We also considered two samples of non-time-delay lenses: 11 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample with Keck-KCWI resolved kinematics; and 4 from the Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample. We improved our analysis of line-of-sight effects, the surface brightness profile of the lens galaxies, and orbital anisotropy, and corrected for projection effects in the dynamics. Our uncertainties are maximally conservative by accounting for the mass-sheet degeneracy in the deflectors' mass density profiles. The analysis was blinded to prevent experimenter bias. Our primary result is based on the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, in combination with $\Omega_{\rm m}$ constraints from the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae (SN) dataset. In the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM), we find $H_0=71.6^{+3.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The SLACS and SL2S samples are in excellent agreement with the TDCOSMO-2025 sample, improving the precision on $H_0$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM to 4.6%. Using the Dark Energy Survey SN Year-5 dataset (DES-SN5YR) or DESI-DR2 baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) likelihoods instead of Pantheon+ yields very similar results. We also present constraints in the open $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, and $w_{\phi}$CDM cosmologies. The TDCOSMO $H_0$ inference is robust and consistent across all presented cosmological models, and our cosmological constraints in them agree with those from the BAO and SN.</description>

      <title>Indicator Functions: Distilling the Information from Gaussian Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random Gaussian density field contains a fixed amount of Fisher information on the amplitude of its power spectrum. For a given smoothing scale, however, that information is not evenly distributed throughout the smoothed field. We investigate which parts of the field contain the most information by smoothing and splitting the field into different levels of density (using the formalism of indicator functions), deriving analytic expressions for the information content of each density bin in the joint-probability distribution (given a distance separation). When we choose one particular distance regime (i.e., cells separated by $60$-$80h^{-1}$ Mpc), we find that the information in that range peaks at moderately rare densities (where the number of smoothed survey cells is roughly of order of magnitude 100). Counter-intuitively, we find that, for a finite survey volume (again at a particular distance range), indicator function analysis can outperform conventional two-point statistics while using only a fraction of the total survey cells, and we explain why. In light of recent developments in marked statistics (such as the indicator power spectrum and density-split clustering), this result elucidates how to optimize sampling for effective extraction of cosmological information.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: A Physically Motivated Closure and Observational Test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-point correlation function (3PCF) is a crucial probe of non-Gaussianity and nonlinear structure formation. We develop a thermodynamic framework for the galaxy 3PCF by closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a physically motivated hierarchical ansatz, yielding a separable, analytic solution for the equilateral 3PCF. Our framework addresses the apparent discrepancy between the perturbation theory prediction for dark matter ($Q_{dm} \approx 1.6$) and observed galaxy measurements ($Q_{gal} \approx 0.5$) by incorporating thermodynamic virial effects and velocity dispersion. We validate this model with SDSS/BOSS CMASS measurements, obtaining an excellent fit ($\chi^2/\mathrm{dof} = 1.27$) across $1$-$50,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The analysis utilizes the Szapudi-Szalay estimator with robust covariance estimation from the SLICS simulation suite. By linking the thermodynamic temperature $T$ to the small-scale velocity dispersion (Fingers-of-God), we establish the thermodynamic approach as a predictive, complementary description of higher-order galaxy clustering on quasi-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Mitigating incoherent excess variance in high-redshift 21 cm observations with multi-output cross-Gaussian process regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21 cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21 cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21 cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21 cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21 cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21 cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21 cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21 cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21 cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21 cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21 cm signal.</description>

Abstract: We present updated constraints on an interacting dark energy - dark matter model with pure momentum transfer, where dark energy is in the form of a quintessence scalar field with an exponential potential. We run a suite of MCMC analyses using the DESI DR2 BAO measurements, in combination with CMB data from Planck and supernovae data from DESY5. In contrast to the standard case of uncoupled quintessence, we find that values for the potential's slope parameter $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$, which are conjectured by string theory scenarios, are not excluded. If $\lambda$ is fixed to such a value, we find that the data favour the negative coupling branch of the model, which is the branch exhibiting late-time growth suppression. We also derive 95% upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses, finding $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.06$ eV ($\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.16$ eV) when $\lambda$ is fixed (varied). Our results motivate further studies on dynamical dark energy models that obey string theory bounds and can be constrained with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Echoes from the dark: Galaxy catalog incompleteness in standard siren cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations can be combined with galaxy catalogs to constrain cosmology and test modified gravity theories using the standard siren method. However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected, thereby weakening constraints and potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precisions of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable even when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.</description>

      <title>Transverse Velocities in Real-Time Cosmology: Position Drift in Relativistic N-Body Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity, which is notoriously difficult to measure and is typically inferred statistically from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Energy Changing? Probing the Universe's Expansion with present and future astronomical probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the possibility of a time-varying dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) deviating from -1. We employ a comprehensive dataset of usual astronomical probes (Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, Hubble data, and Planck 2018 CMB) alongside future mock gravitational wave (GW) distance measurements from the Einstein Telescope. We utilize the Pad'e approximation, a versatile framework encompassing well-known DE models like constant EoS, Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization and other time-evolving DE parametrizations. Within Pad'e parametrization, we examine three specific forms (Pad'e-I, SPad'e-I, Pad'e-II) applied to both spatially flat and non-flat universes. Pad'e-II exhibits particularly interesting features in terms of the evidence of dynamical DE at many standard deviations. Our results can be summarized as follows. Flat Universe: When analyzing the combined dataset of standard probes (including CMB) with Pad'e-II in a flat universe, we find a strong preference (6.4{\sigma}) for a dynamical (time-varying) DE EoS. This preference remains significant (4.7{\sigma}) even when incorporating future GW data. Non-Flat Universe: In a non-flat universe, the combined standard datasets (without or with CMB) also indicate dynamical DE EoS at a high confidence level (6.2{\sigma} and 6.4{\sigma}, respectively). The addition of GW data slightly reduces the evidence (3.8{\sigma} and 5.1{\sigma}, respectively), but the preference persists. These results collectively suggest a robust case for dynamical DE in the dark sector. While a non-flat universe is not strongly favored, Pad'e-II hints at a possible closed universe when CMB data is included (with or without GW data).</description>

      <title>The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power -- up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.767\pm 0.042$ and $S_8 = 0.793\pm 0.035$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k &gt; \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Nonlinear Systematics in Weak Lensing Surveys II: Stability and Diagnostics with Intrinsic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform provides a powerful framework for analysing tomographic cosmic shear data by improving the localization of shear correlations in physical scale. It operates by performing a linear combination of the shear data vector in $\ell$-space, yielding a transformed vector that is better localized in both redshift and $k$-space. BNT is particularly useful for estimating cosmological parameters while minimizing the impact of poorly understood nonlinear physics, without discarding large amounts of information as is typically done with simple scale cuts. In our previous work, we showed that BNT outperforms traditional weak-lensing analyses; however, that study did not include intrinsic alignments (IA). In the present work, we assess the robustness of our BNT-based $k$-cut framework in the presence of realistic IA models. We consider two cases: (i) when the assumed IA model used in sampling is close to, but not identical to, the true one, and (ii) when the assumed IA model is significantly biased compared to the true one. In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. Using Euclid-like mock data and a stringent $k$-cut of $k \le 0.1\;{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for all tomographic bins, we found that BNT can constrain $S_8$ with a precision better than 2\% while non-BNT has lost all constraining power. In the second case, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in $k$-space and redshift-space both exceeding 5$\sigma$ when the functional form of the sampling and fiducial IA models differ fundamentally.</description>

      <title>DESI-DR1 $3 \times 2$-pt analysis: consistent cosmology across weak lensing surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.</description>

      <title>The Power of DESI for Photometric Redshift Calibration: A Case Study with KiDS-1000</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate redshift estimates are a critical requirement for weak lensing surveys and one of the main uncertainties in constraints on dark energy and large-scale cosmic structure. In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.</description>

      <title>The contribution from small scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\sim 1.1\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During a cosmological first-order phase transition in a dark sector, fermion dark matter particles $\chi$ can form macroscopic Fermi balls that collapse to primordial black holes (PBHs) under certain conditions. The evaporation of the PBHs produces a boosted $\chi$ flux, which may be detectable if $\chi$ couples to visible matter. We consider the interaction of $\chi$ with electrons, and calculate signals of the dark matter flux in the XENON1T, XENONnT, Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. A correlated gravitational wave signal from the phase transition can be observed at THEIA and $\mu$Ares. An amount of dark radiation measurable by CMB-S4 is an epiphenomenon of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Stellar Stripping and Disruption in Disks around Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Repeating nuclear transients prior to LISA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are driven together by gas disks in galactic nuclei, then a surrounding nuclear star cluster or in-situ star-formation should deliver stars to the disk plane. Migration through the circumbinary disk will quickly bring stars to the edge of a low-density cavity cleared by the binary, where the stellar orbit becomes trapped and locked with the binary decay. Here we explore the scenario where the trapped stellar orbit decays with the binary until the binary tidally strips the star in a runaway process. For Sun-like stars, this occurs preferentially for $10^4-10^6 M_{\odot}$ SMBHBs, as the SMBHB enters the LISA band. We estimate that the runaway stripping process will generate Eddington-level X-ray flares repeating on hours-to-days timescales and lasting for decades. The flaring timescales and energetics of these circumbinary-disk tidal-disruption events (CBD-TDEs) match well with the recently discovered Quasi-Periodic Eruptions. However, the inferred rates of the two phenomena are in tension, unless low-mass SMBHB mergers are more common than expected. For less-dense stars, stripping begins earlier in the SMBHB inspiral, has longer repetition times, lasts longer, is dimmer, and can occur for more massive SMBHBs. Whether CBD-TDEs are a known or a yet-undiscovered class of repeating nuclear transients, they could provide a new probe of the elusive SMBH mergers in low mass / dwarf galaxies, which lie in the sweet-spot of the LISA sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>The Possibility of Formation of Compact Boson Stars via Cosmological Evolution of a Background Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boson stars, hypothetical astrophysical objects bound by the self-gravity of a scalar field, have been widely studied as a type of exotic compact object that is horizonless and provides a testing ground for physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, many previous works have demonstrated methods for distinguishing compact boson stars from black holes in general relativity through gravitational wave observations. However, the formation scenario of compact boson stars within the age of the universe remains unclear. In this paper, we explore a possible scenario for the formation of compact boson stars. The model we consider requires two coupled scalar fields: a complex scalar field that forms a boson star and a spatially homogeneous background field, as formation of a compact boson star cannot be achieved in a single filed model. Using the adiabatic approximation, we show that non-relativistic boson clouds can evolve into compact boson stars through the cosmological time-evolution of the background field. In our model the background field evolves to increase the effective mass of the scalar field, and as a result compact boson stars can form within the cosmological timescale, if the variation of the background field is as large as the Planck scale. However, further investigation is required because the required initial states are not the configurations that can be described by the well-studied Schr\"odinger-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Isocurvature Bounds on the Minimal QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion has important connections to early universe cosmology. For example, it is often said that isocurvature limits rule out a combination of high axion decay constant, $f_a$, and high inflationary Hubble scale, $H_I$. High scales are theoretically motivated, so it is important to ask how robust this constraint is. We demonstrate that this constraint is naturally evaded when the quartic coupling of the complex $U(1)_\mathrm{PQ}$-breaking field is small. In this case, $f_a$ changes from a larger value during inflation to a smaller value in the later universe, suppressing isocurvature perturbations. Importantly, we show that in large parts of parameter space this solution is not jeopardised by overproduction of the axion through parametric resonance. The isocurvature bounds are thus dependent on UV physics. We have found that, even for the minimal QCD axion, large parts of UV parameter space at both high $f_a$ and high $H_I$ are in fact allowed, not ruled out by isocurvature constraints.</description>

      <title>Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</title>

Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>

      <title>Predicting stellar collision outcomes of main sequence stars</title>

Abstract: Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic characterization of a remarkable temporally varying, triple-lensed quasar at z=2.67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the independent spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar at $z=2.67$, identified based on astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, previously identified in Pan-STARRS. Furthermore, a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <title>Delayed Scaling of Multi-Type Cosmic F- and D-strings in VOS Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model to the case of one cosmic F-string and two D-strings as color flux tubes in pure Spin($4N$) gauge theory. We analytically calculate the scaling string density as a function of the reconnection probabilities, and confirm our results with numerical calculations. We also determine the timescale at which the string density reaches the scaling regime, and find that for certain values of the reconnection probability, the scaling time can become extremely large, by many orders of magnitude. This leads to a characteristic suppression signature of the gravitational-wave signal at high frequencies, which may become observable in the frequency range of future interferometric gravitational-wave observations.</description>
