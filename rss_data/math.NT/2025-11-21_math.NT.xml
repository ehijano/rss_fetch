      <title>Local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a number field $k$ with the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_k$ and a matrix $M\in \mathrm{M}_{n}(\mathcal{O}_k)$. We prove that if $\mathcal{O}_k$ is a principal ideal domain, the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ holds. To explain the possible failures of the local-global principle, we prove that the stratified Brauer--Manin obstruction is the only obstruction to the local-global principle for triangularizability and diagonalizability of $M$ in some special cases.</description>

      <title>Elementary Bounds on Digital Sums of Powers, Factorials, and LCMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the sum of the base-$b$ digits of $a^{n}$ grows at least logarithmically in $n$ if $\log(d)/\log(b)$ is irrational, where $d$ is the smallest factor of $a$ such that $\gcd(a/d, b) = 1$. Our approach uses only elementary number theory and applies to a wide class of sequences, including factorials and $\Lambda(n) = lcm(1, 2, \ldots, n)$. We conclude with an expository proof of the previously known result that the sum of the base-$b$ digits of $a^{n}$ tends to infinity with $n$ if and only if $\log(a)/\log(b)$ is irrational.</description>

      <title>A Dirichlet Generating Function for the Coefficients of Euler's Pentagonal Number Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an integral representation for the Dirichlet generating function of the coefficients of Euler's pentagonal number theorem. The Bromwich-type integral enables analytic continuation to the entire complex plane, filling a gap in the literature and providing a new framework for studying the sequence's analytic structure. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic behavior as the variable tends to negative infinity, and give integral representations for the Euler function $\phi(q)$ and the Dedekind eta function $\eta(\tau)$. Moreover, we obtain an explicit formula for the Dirichlet generating function at each positive integer, expressed as a finite sum.</description>

      <title>The Landau-Selberg-Delange method for products of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and applications, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Selberg-Delange method gives precise asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ of a Dirichlet series $\sum_n \, a_n/n^s$ that behaves like a complex power of the Riemann zeta function. However, situations often arise when the Dirichlet series behaves like a product of complex powers of several Dirichlet $L$-functions to a modulus $q$. In such situations, one often requires sharp asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ that apply in much wider ranges of $q$ than permitted by known forms of the Landau-Selberg-Delange method. In this manuscript, we address this problem, giving new estimates on $\sum_{n \le x} \, a_n$ in ranges of $q$ that are (in most applications) much wider than attainable from previous results. Our results also weaken certain hypotheses on the size of $\{a_n\}_n$. As applications of our main theorems, we extend Landau's classical results on the distribution of integers with prime factors restricted to progressions, and improve upon Chang, Martin and Nguyen's work on the distributions of the least invariant factors and least primary factors of multiplicative groups. We also extend the classical Sathe-Selberg theorem and study the local laws of the functions $\Omega_a(n)$ and $\omega_a(n)$, that count (with and without multiplicity, respectively), the number of prime divisors of $n$ lying in the progression $a$ mod $q$.</description>

      <title>Affine Chabauty I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove finiteness and give an explicit upper bound on the number of $S$-integral points on affine curves satisfying a certain rank-genus inequality. We achieve this by developing an analogue of the Chabauty method, embedding the curve into its generalised Jacobian and bounding the Abel-Jacobi image of the $S$-integral points using arithmetic intersection theory. Our results also provide the foundations for a computational method to determine the set of $S$-integral points on affine curves which will be presented in a follow-up article.</description>

      <title>Superelliptic degree sets over Henselian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a discretely valued Henselian field. Creutz and Viray show that the degree set of a curve $C$ over a $p$-adic field can miss infinitely many multiples of the index of $C$, a phenomenon that cannot occur over finitely generated fields. For curves $C/K$ with a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^1$ of prime degree, under mild assumptions, we completely characterize how and when this behavior can occur, and give a method for computing degree sets of curves of this type.</description>

      <title>Change of weights operations for triangulated $({\varphi},{\Gamma})$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zhixiang Wu has shown the existence of "change of weights" operation on $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in families (arxiv:2405.16637). We interpret it in the trianguline case as pullbacks with a discussion on related stacks. Finally, we prove that it intertwines well with translation functors via a 1-1 correspondence defined by Yiwen Ding (arXiv:2407.21237) in the non-critical crystabelline case.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Congruences for Eta-quotient newforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973, Swinnerton-Dyer completely classified all congruences for coefficients of normalized eigenforms in weights $k \in \{12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 26\}$ on $\Gamma_{0}(1) = \operatorname{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ using the theory of modular Galois representations. In this paper, we classify congruences of Type I and Type II considered by Swinnerton-Dyer for the coefficients of eta-quotient newforms in $S_{k}(N, \chi)$. When $k \geq 2$, we prove them using the theory of modular forms modulo primes. We also prove extensions of these congruences modulo prime powers.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Non-Roots of D'Arcais Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lehmer conjecture states that the non-constant Fourier coefficients of the 24th power of the Dedekind eta function are non-zero. In a recent preprint, Neuhauser and the first author exploited an easily accessible tool from algebraic number theory, namely the Dedekind--Kummer Theorem, to prove the non-vanishing of the Fourier coefficients of certain powers of the Dedekind eta function at roots of unity. We extend the application of this method to enlarge the scope of non-roots of the related D'Arcais polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Given $\beta\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ with $|\beta|&gt;1$ and a finite set $D\subset\mathbb{Q}(i)$, let \[K_{\beta, D}=\left\{\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}\frac{d_j}{\beta^j}: d_j\in D, \forall j\geq 1\right\}.\] Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of non-associate prime elements in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ not dividing $\beta$. We prove that if the Hausdorff dimension of $K_{\beta,D}$ is less than $1$, then there are only finitely many Gaussian rational numbers in $K_{\beta,D}$ whose denominators have all their prime factors in $\mathcal{S}$.</description>

      <title>Primes in arithmetic progressions under the presence of Landau-Siegel zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x\geqslant 2$ and assume that $a$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers. As usual, $\psi(x;q,a):=\sum_{n\leqslant x,n\equiv a(\!\!\!\mod{\!\!q})}\Lambda(n)$, where $\Lambda$ is the von Mangoldt function. In 2003, Friedlander and Iwaniec assumed the existence of exceptional characters corresponding to "extreme" Landau-Siegel zeroes and established a meaningful asymptotic formula for $\psi(x;q,a)$ beyond the square-root barrier of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. In particular, their asymptotic yields non-trivial information for moduli $q\leqslant x^{1/2+1/231}$. In this paper, we considerably relax the extremity of the Landau-Siegel zero required in the work of Friedlander and Iwaniec and obtain a conditional asymptotic formula for $\psi(x;q,a)$ in a slightly wider range of $q$.</description>

      <title>The metric theory of small gaps for a sequence of real numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of distinct positive integers. The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\{\alpha a_n \text{ mod }1, 1\leq n \leq N\}$ as $N \to \infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$ for almost every $\alpha$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_N\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \emph{integer} sequences to the case of \emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $\delta_{\min}^{\alpha}(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\lfloor \delta^{\alpha}_{\min} \rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Relations for k-Fold Nested Power Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the $k$-nested sum of integer powers, $F(n,m,k)$, defined as repeated partial sums of the classical Faulhaber polynomials. We provide an explicit recurrence relation relating $F(n,m,k)$ to sums of lower power $m-1$ and higher nesting level $k+1$. This identity is derived from a core algebraic relation on the binomial coefficients that form the kernel of the nested sum's representation. We discuss the relevance to the 2010 paper by S.~Butler and P.~Karasik, ``A Note on Nested Sums'' (JIS, Vol.~13, Article~10.4.4), which studies nested sums of powers of integers that generalize Faulhaber-type sums. We also discuss the equivalence to a related recurrence previously established in the context of hypersums of powers of integers by J.~L.~Cereceda.</description>

      <title>Semistable Reduction of Plane Quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stable Reduction Theorem guarantees that any smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus $g \geq 2$ over a discretely valued field admits a unique stable model after a finite field extension. Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of the famous LLL algorithm, lattice reduction has been an extremely useful tool in computational number theory. By construction, the LLL algorithm deals with lattices living in a vector space endowed with a positive definite scalar product. However, it seems quite nature to ask about the indefinite case, where the scalar product is replaced by an arbitrary quadratic form, possibily indefinite. This question was considered independently in two lines of work. One by G{\'a}bor Ivanyos and {\'A}gnes Sz{\'a}nt{\'o} and one by Denis Simon. Both lead to an algorithm that generalizes LLL and whose performance is very similar to LLL, i.e. a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the shortest vector within an approximation factor exponential in the dimension. Denis Simon achieves an approximation factor close to that of LLL under the assumption that no isotropic vectors arise during reduction. G{\'a}bor Ivanyos and {\'A}gnes Sz{\'a}nt{\'o} show that it is possible to avoid isotropic vectors altogether, at the cost of a somewhat worse approximation factor.  In this paper, we revisit the reduction of indefinite lattices and conclude that it can lead to much better reduced representations that previously thought. We also conclude that the approximation factor depends on the signature of the indefinite lattice rather than on its dimension.</description>

      <title>Block-Separated Overpartitions and Their Fibonacci-Type Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new restricted family of overpartitions, called block-separated overpartitions, in which no two consecutive distinct part-size blocks may both be overlined. Using a two-state transfer-matrix automaton, we derive a closed matrix-product expression for the ordinary generating function, establish an Euler-type factorization, and obtain an explicit normalized recurrence suitable for computation of arbitrary coefficients. We further prove that the possible overlining patterns on the distinct blocks are counted by Fibonacci numbers, giving natural bijections with independent sets on paths, pattern-avoiding binary words, and Fibonacci tilings.</description>

      <title>Riesz products and the Lonely Runner Conjecture: A wider gap of loneliness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lonely runner conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that if $n$ runners with distinct constant speeds run around a a circular unit length track, starting at a common time and place, then each runner will at some time be separated by a distance of at least $\frac{1}{n}$ from all other runners. A weaker lower bound of $\frac{1}{2n-2}$ follows from the so-called trivial union bound, and subsequent work upgraded this to bounds of the form $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{c}{n^2}$ for various constants $c&gt;0$. Tao strengthened this to $\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}{n^2}$. In this paper, we obtain a polynomial improvement of the form $$\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1}{n^{5/3+o(1)}}.$$</description>

      <title>Crystalline Chebotar\"ev density theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.07084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Tannakian formalism, we formulate conjectural analogs of Chebotar\"ev's Density Theorem for $F$-isocrystals over a smooth geometrically irreducible variety defined over a finite field. We prove these analogs for several large classes, including (a) constant $F$-isocrystals, (b) direct sums of isoclinic convergent $F$-isocrystals, (c) semi-simple overconvergent $F$-isocrystals, and (d) semi-simple convergent $F$-isocrystals which have an overconvergent extension. Case (a) is a generalization of the Mordell-Lang Conjecture for tori and enters in the proofs of (b) and (c). For (b) we use the classical Chebotar\"ev Density Theorem, and point counting techniques in $p$-adic Lie groups building on a result of Oesterl\'e. For (c) we give two proofs. One of them uses deep input on the Langlands correspondence by Abe and Lafforgue, and the theory of Frobenius weights of Kedlaya, Abe and Caro. Building on this we formulate and prove the $p$-adic analog of Deligne's Equidistribution Theorem. Then (c) follows by applying real algebraic geometry to maximal compact subgroups in complex algebraic groups, measure theory, and a convergence result on complex hypersurfaces. For (d) we develop the theory of maximal quasi-tori (generalizing maximal tori in non-connected linear algebraic groups) and use D'Addezio's result on Crew's parabolicity conjecture to reduce to (b). These arguments also yield a second proof of (c). Besides of the deep inputs mentioned above and some Tannakian arguments, our main technique is the theory of linear algebraic groups. We include a comparison with the recent article of Cadoret and Tamagawa on the same topic.</description>

      <title>Congruence counting in Schottky and continued fractions semigroups of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the two settings we are concerned with are $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SO}(n, 1)$ a Zariski dense Schottky semigroup and $\Gamma &lt; \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb C)$ a Zariski dense continued fractions semigroup. In both settings, we prove a uniform asymptotic counting formula for the associated congruence subsemigroups, generalizing the work of Magee-Oh-Winter [arXiv:1601.03705] in $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$ to higher dimensions. Superficially, the proof requires two separate strategies: the expander machinery of Golsefidy-Varj\'u, based on the work of Bourgain-Gamburd-Sarnak, and Dolgopyat's method. However, there are several challenges in higher dimensions. Firstly, using the expander machinery requires a key input: the Zariski density and full trace field property of the return trajectory subgroups, newly introduced in [arXiv:2006.07787]. Secondly, we need to adapt Stoyanov's version of Dolgopyat's method to circumvent some technical issues while the main difficulty is to prove the key inputs: the local non-integrability condition (LNIC) and the non-concentration property (NCP).</description>

      <title>Minimal ring extensions of the integers exhibiting Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</description>

      <title>The topology of the set of multiple zeta-star values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a multiple integral representation for each multiple zeta-star value, and utilize these representations to establish a natural order structure on the set of such values. This order structure allows for a one-to-one correspondence between a subset of the infinite sequences of natural numbers and the half line $(1,+\infty)$. Some basic properties of this correspondence are discussed. We also calculate the Hausdorff dimensions for the images of some subsets of the infinite sequences under this correspondence. As a result of this correspondence, we are able to determine the limits for a number of natural multiple integrals. Our analysis also reveals that the set of multiple zeta-star values is dense within the $(1,+\infty)$ domain, and that each value is non-integer in nature.</description>

      <title>Translates of completely normal elements and the Morgan-Mullen conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field of order $q$ and by $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ its extension of degree $n$. Some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called primitive if it generates the multiplicative group $\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ and it is called $q^n/q$-normal if its $\mathbb F_q$-conjugates form an $\mathbb F_q$-basis of $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ if the latter is viewed as an $\mathbb F_q$-vector space. Furthermore, some $a\in\mathbb F_{q^n}$ is called $q^n/q$-completely normal if it is $q^n/q^d$-normal for all $d\mid n$. In this work we prove a new construction of sets of completely normal elements and, we establish, under conditions, the existence of elements that are simultaneously primitive and $q^n/q$-completely normal, covering some yet unresolved cases of a 30-year-old conjecture by Morgan and Mullen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider \begin{align*} G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q) = \sum\limits_{j\in\mathbb{Z}}(-1)^jq^{\frac{1}{2}Kj((\alpha+\beta)j+\alpha-\beta)}\left[\begin{matrix}M+N\\N-Kj\end{matrix}\right]_{q}. \end{align*} In this paper, we prove the non-negativity of coefficients of some cases of $G(N,M;\alpha,\beta,K,q)$. For instance, for non-negative integers $n$ and $t$, we prove that\\ \begin{align*} G\left(n,n;\frac{4}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},\frac{5}{3}+\frac{3(3^t-1)}{2},3^{t+1},q\right) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} G\left(n-\frac{3^t-1}{2},n+\frac{3^t+1}{2};\frac{8}{3}+2(3^t-1),\frac{4}{3}-(3^t-1),3^{t+1},q\right)\\ \end{align*} are polynomials in $q$ with non-negative coefficients. Using cubic positivity preserving transformations of Berkovich and Warnaar and some known formulae arising from Rogers-Szeg\"{o} polynomials, we establish new identities such as\\ \begin{align*} \sum\limits_{0\le 3j\le n}\dfrac{(q^3;q^3)_{n-j-1}(1-q^{2n})q^{3j^2}}{(q;q)_{n-3j}(q^6;q^6)_{j}} = \sum\limits_{j=-\infty}^{\infty}(-1)^jq^{6j^2}{2n\brack n-3j}_q. \end{align*}</description>

      <title>On the irrationality exponent of real numbers with low complexity expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a real number and $b \ge 2$ an integer. We study the relationship between the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ and the subword complexity $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ of the $b$-ary expansion $\mathbf{x}$ of $\xi$, where $p(n, \mathbf{x})$ counts the number of distinct blocks of length $n$ in $\mathbf{x}$, for $n \ge 1$. If the irrationality exponent of $\xi$ is equal to $2$, which is the case for almost all real numbers $\xi$, we show that the limit superior of the sequence $(p(n, \mathbf{x}) / n)_{n \ge 1}$ is at least equal to 4/3. The proof is based on a careful study of the evolution of the Rauzy graphs of infinite words of low complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Choie and Kumar extensively studied the Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$, defined as \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v) = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} dt, \quad \textrm{for} \quad \mathfrak{Re}(z)&gt;0. \end{align*} They obtained two-term, three-term and six-term functional equations for $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ and also evaluated special values in terms of di-logarithmic functions. Motivated from their work, we study the following two integrals, \begin{align*} \mathfrak{F}(z;u,v,w) &amp;=\int_{0}^1 \frac{\log(1-ut^z)\log(1-wt^z)}{v^{-1}-t}\text{d}t, \\ \mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v) &amp;= \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log^k(1-ut^z)}{v^{-1}-t} \, \text{d}t, \end{align*} for $\mathfrak{Re}(z)&gt;0$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $k=1$, the integral $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$ reduces to $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$. This allows us to recover the properties of $\mathfrak{F}(z;u,v)$ by studying the properties of $\mathfrak{F}_k(z;u,v)$. We evaluate special values of these two functions in terms of poly-logarithmic functions.</description>

Abstract: We state a conjecture relating de Rham cohomology of a smooth rigid analytic variety to its compactly supported pro-\'etale cohomology. We prove the conjecture in the cases where the variety is a Stein curve of dimension one or a Stein space of higher dimension with low Frobenius slopes. The proof uses computation of the Galois cohomology of the almost de Rham period ring BdR[log(t)].</description>

Abstract: Basis partitions are minimal partitions corresponding to successive rank vectors. We show combinatorially how basis partitions can be generated from primary partitions which are equivalent to the Rogers-Ramanujan partitions. This leads to the definition of a signature of a basis partition that we use to explain certain parity results. We then study a special class of basis partitions which we term as complete. Finally we discuss basis partitions and minimal basis partitions among partitions with non-repeating odd parts by representing them using 2-modular graphs.</description>
