      <title>On the Use of Letters of Recommendation in Astronomy and Astrophysics Graduate Admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Letters of recommendation are a common tool used in graduate admissions. Most admissions systems require three letters for each applicant, burdening both letter writers and admissions committees with a heavy work load that may not be time well-spent. Most applicants do not have three research advisors who can comment meaningfully on research readiness, adding a large number of letters that are not useful. Ideally, letters of recommendation will showcase the students' promise for a research career, but in practice, the letters often do not fulfill this purpose.
  As a group of early and mid-career faculty who write dozens of letters every year for promising undergraduates, we are concerned and overburdened by the inefficiencies of the current system. In this open letter to the AAS Graduate Admissions Task Force, we offer an alternative to the current use of letters of recommendation: a portfolio submitted by the student, which highlights e.g., a paper, plot, or presentation that represents their past work and readiness for grad school, uploaded to a centralized system used by astronomy and astrophysics PhD programs. While we argue that we could eliminate letters in this new paradigm, it may instead be advisable to limit the number of letters of recommendation to one per applicant.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{UFig v1}$: The ultra-fast image generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods, simulations need to be fast as well as realistic. $\texttt{UFig v1}$ is a public Python package that generates simulated astronomical images with exceptional speed - taking approximately the same time as source extraction. This makes it particularly well-suited for simulation-based inference (SBI) methods where computational efficiency is crucial. To render an image, $\texttt{UFig}$ requires a galaxy catalog and a description of the point spread function (PSF). It can also add background noise, sample stars using the Besan\c{c}on model of the Milky Way, and run $\texttt{SExtractor}$ to extract sources from the rendered image. The extracted sources can be matched to the intrinsic catalog, flagged based on $\texttt{SExtractor}$ output and survey masks, and emulators can be used to bypass the image simulation and extraction steps. A first version of $\texttt{UFig}$ was presented in Berg\'e et al. (2013) and the software has since been used and further developed in a variety of forward modelling applications.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside the three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters ($\log g$, $T_{\text{eff}}$, $A_V$, $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic HST/WFC3 UVIS and IR fluxes, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred SEDs from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>ESpRESSO -- Forward modeling Roman Space Telescope spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the software package $\texttt{ESpRESSO}$ - [E]xtragalactic [Sp]ectroscopic [R]oman [E]mulator and [S]imulator of [S]ynthetic [O]bjects, created to emulate the slitless spectroscopic observing modes of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) Wide Field Instrument (WFI). We combine archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data of comparable spatial resolution with model spectral energy distributions to create a data-cube of flux density as a function of position and wavelength. This data-cube is used for simulating a nine detector grism observation, producing a crowded background scene which model field angle dependent optical distortions expected for the grism. We also demonstrate the ability to inject custom sources using the described tools and pipelines. In addition, we show that spectral features such as emission line pairs are unlikely to be mistaken as off order contaminating features and vice versa. Our result is a simulation suite of half of the eighteen detector array, with a realistic background scene and injected Ly$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) galaxies, realized at 25 position angles (PAs), 12 with analogous positive and negative dithers, Using an exposure time of 10ks per PA, the full PA set can be used as a mock deep Roman grism survey with high (synthetic) LAE completeness for developing future spectral data analysis tools.</description>

      <title>herakoi: a sonification experiment for astronomical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research is revealing data-sonification as a promising complementary approach to vision, benefiting both data perception and interpretation. We present herakoi, a novel open-source software that uses machine learning to allow real-time image sonification, with a focus on astronomical data. By tracking hand movements via a webcam and mapping them to image coordinates, herakoi translates visual properties into sound, enabling users to "hear" images. Its swift responsiveness allows users to access information in astronomical images with short training, demonstrating high reliability and effectiveness. The software has shown promise in educational and outreach settings, making complex astronomical concepts more engaging and accessible to diverse audiences, including blind and visually impaired individuals. We also discuss future developments, such as the integration of large language and vision models to create a more interactive experience in interpreting astronomical data.</description>

      <title>A new and flexible design method for Symmetric Quadrature Hybrid Couplers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrature Hybrid Couplers (QHDC) are critical components in RF, mm-wave, and sub-mm wave astronomical instrumentation, where wideband performance with minimal passband ripple is essential. Traditional designs have been limited to 5-sections at most due to computational limitations. In this work, we introduce a new analytical technique to design couplers with larger sections and improved performance. We do this by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based solver. By defining a likelihood function based on S-parameter equations and incorporating physical priors, we derive optimized impedance values that enhance bandwidth beyond what is reported in the literature. Our flexible pipeline allows efficient tuning of the coupler design. The results demonstrate fractional bandwidths that reach 1.0 for a 9-section coupler, substantially outperforming previous designs. Statistical analysis and convergence tests confirm the robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>

      <title>Evidence of enhanced two-level system loss suppression in high-Q, thin film aluminum microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As superconducting kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) continue to grow in popularity for sensitive sub-mm detection and other applications, there is a drive to advance toward lower loss devices. We present measurements of diagnostic thin film aluminum coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators designed to inform ongoing KID development at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The resonators span $\rm f_0 = 3.5 - 4$\,GHz and include both quarter-wave and half-wave resonators with varying coupling capacitor designs. We present measurements of the device film properties and an analysis of the dominant mechanisms of loss in the resonators measured in a dark environment. We demonstrate quality factors of $\rm Q_i^{-1} \approx 3.64 - 8.57 \times10^{-8}$, and observe enhanced suppression of two-level system (TLS) loss in our devices at high internal microwave power levels before the onset of quasiparticle dissipation from microwave heating. We observe deviations from the standard TLS loss model at low powers and temperatures below 60 mK, and use a modified model to describe this behavior.</description>

      <title>Characterizing hole trap production due to proton irradiation in germanium cross-strip detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the effects of high-energy proton damage on charge trapping in germanium cross-strip detectors, with the goal of accomplishing three important measurements. First, we calibrated and characterized the spectral resolution of a spare COSI-balloon detector in order to determine the effects of intrinsic trapping, finding that electron trapping due to impurities dominates over hole trapping in the undamaged detector. Second, we performed two rounds of proton irradiation of the detector in order to quantify, for the first time, the rate at which charge traps are produced by proton irradiation. We find that the product of the hole trap density and cross-sectional area, $[n\sigma]_\mathrm{h}$ follows a linear relationship with the proton fluence, $F_\mathrm{p}$, with a slope of $(5.4\pm0.4)\times10^{-11}\,\mathrm{cm/p^{+}}$. Third, by utilizing our measurements of physical trapping parameters, we performed calibrations which corrected for the effects of trapping and mitigated degradation to the spectral resolution of the detector.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Distances of Extragalactic Binaries through Spectroastrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing ``Hubble tension'' has prompted the need for precise measurements of cosmological distances. This paper demonstrates a purely geometric approach for determining the distance to extragalactic binaries through a joint analysis of spectroastrometry (SA), radial velocity (RV), and light curve (LC) observations. A parameterized model for the binary system is outlined, and simulated SA, RV, and LC data are computed to infer the probability distribution of model parameters based on the mock data. The impact of data quality and binary parameters on distance uncertainties is comprehensively analyzed, showcasing the method's potential for high-precision distance measurements. For a typical eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the distance uncertainty is approximately 6% under reasonable observational conditions. Within a specific range of data quality and input parameters, the distance measurement precision of individual binary star systems is generally better than 10%. As a geometric method based on the simplest dynamics, it is independent of empirical calibration and the systematics caused by model selections can be tested using nearby binaries with known distances. By measuring multiple binary star systems or monitoring one binary system repeatedly, geometric distance measurements of nearby galaxies can be achieved, providing valuable insights into the Hubble tension and advancing our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameter prediction and spectral simulation using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied machine learning to the entire data history of ESO's High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument. Our primary goal was to recover the physical properties of the observed objects, with a secondary emphasis on simulating spectra. We systematically investigated the impact of various factors on the accuracy and fidelity of the results, including the use of simulated data, the effect of varying amounts of real training data, network architectures, and learning paradigms. Our approach integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques within autoencoder frameworks. Our methodology leverages an existing simulation model that utilizes a library of existing stellar spectra in which the emerging flux is computed from first principles rooted in physics and a HARPS instrument model to generate simulated spectra comparable to observational data. We trained standard and variational autoencoders on HARPS data to predict spectral parameters and generate spectra. Our models excel at predicting spectral parameters and compressing real spectra, and they achieved a mean prediction error of approximately 50 K for effective temperatures, making them relevant for most astrophysical applications. Furthermore, the models predict metallicity ([M/H]) and surface gravity (log g) with an accuracy of approximately 0.03 dex and 0.04 dex, respectively, underscoring their broad applicability in astrophysical research. The models' computational efficiency, with processing times of 779.6 ms on CPU and 3.97 ms on GPU, makes them valuable for high-throughput applications like massive spectroscopic surveys and large archival studies. By achieving accuracy comparable to classical methods with significantly reduced computation time, our methodology enhances the scope and efficiency of spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Substellar candidates at the earliest stages: the SUCANES database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.</description>

      <title>Primary Beam Chromaticity in HIRAX: I. Characterization from Simulations and Power Spectrum Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is an upcoming radio interferometric telescope designed to constrain dark energy through the 21cm intensity mapping of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Instrumental systematics must be controlled and carefully characterized to measure the 21cm power spectrum with fidelity and achieve high-precision constraints on the cosmological parameters. The chromaticity of the primary beam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally smooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial and spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies the chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate measurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of chromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam modeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics that can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the primary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe and sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple foreground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the H$\textsc{i}$ power spectrum. Additionally, we find that modeling up to the octupolar azimuthal order feature (fourth-order angular variation) in the primary beam is sufficient to reduce the leakage outside the wedge with minimal bias.</description>

      <title>Optical Design of the EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping (EXCLAIM)</title>

Abstract: This work describes the design and implementation of optics for EXCLAIM, the EXperiment for Cryogenic Large-Aperture Intensity Mapping. EXCLAIM is a balloon-borne telescope that will measure integrated line emission from carbon monoxide (CO) at redshifts $z&lt;1$ and ionized carbon ([CII]) at redshifts $z = 2.5-3.5$ to probe star formation over cosmic time in cross-correlation with galaxy redshift surveys. The EXCLAIM instrument is designed to observe at frequencies of $420$--$540$ GHz using six microfabricated silicon integrated spectrometers with spectral resolving power $R = 512$ coupled to kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). A completely cryogenic telescope cooled to a temperature below 5~K provides low-background observations between narrow atmospheric lines in the stratosphere. Off-axis reflective optics use a $90$-cm primary mirror to provide $4.2^\prime$ full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at the center of the EXCLAIM band over a field of view of $22.5^\prime$. Illumination of the $1.7$ K cold stop combined with blackened baffling at multiple places in the optical system ensure low ($&lt; -40$ dB) edge illumination of the primary to minimize spill onto warmer elements at the top of the dewar.</description>

      <title>Analysis of biasing from noise from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: implications for weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, set to launch in 2026, will bring unprecedented precision to measurements of weak gravitational lensing. Because weak lensing is an inherently small signal, it is imperative to minimize systematic errors in measurements as completely as possible; this will ensure that the lensing measurements can be used to their full potential when extracting cosmological information. In this paper, we use laboratory tests of the Roman detectors, simulations of the Roman High Latitude Survey observations, and the proposed Roman image combination pipeline to investigate the magnitude of detector read noise biasing on weak lensing measurements from Roman. First, we combine lab-measured detector noise fields with simulated observations and propagate these images through the Roman image combination pipeline, IMCOM. We characterize the specific signatures of the noise fields in the resultant images and find that noise contributes to the combined images most strongly at scales relevant to physical characteristics of the detector including PSF shape, chip boundaries, and roll angles. We then measure shapes of simulated stars and galaxies and determine the magnitude of noise-induced shear bias on these measurements. We find that star shape correlations satisfy the system noise requirements as defined by the Roman Science Requirements Document. However, for galaxies fainter than $m_{\rm AB}\simeq24$, correction for noise correlations will be needed in order to ensure confidence in shape measurements in any observation band.</description>

      <title>votess: A multi-target, GPU-capable, parallel Voronoi tessellator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: votess is a library for computing parallel 3D Voronoi tessellations on heterogeneous platforms, from CPUs and GPUs, to future accelerator architectures. To do so, it leverages the SYCL abstraction layer to achieve portability and performance across these architectures. The core library is an implementation of a Voronoi cell-by-cell computation algorithm, producing the geometry of the cells and their neighbor connectivity information, rather than a full combinatorial mesh data structure. This simplifies the Voronoi tessellation and makes it more suitable to data parallel architectures than alternatives such as sequential insertion or the Bowyer-Watson algorithm. The library demonstrates significant performance improvements over established single-threaded programs and serves as a foundational tool for performance-critical applications, such as on-the-fly computations in hydrodynamical codes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Near-Real Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval Methods from Precise Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the density of the thermosphere during geomagnetic storms is critical for both thermosphere modelling efforts and satellite operations. Accurate near-real time density estimates can feed into data assimilation schemes and provide operators with an early warning system for storm-triggered drag increases. This study evaluates two methods for generating near-real time thermospheric density estimates: the Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) method and the Precise Orbit Determination (POD)-accelerometry method.
  Using accelerometer-derived densities from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) and Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) spacecraft as truth over 45 geomagnetic storms, the POD accelerometry method was found to surpass EDR density retrieval as well as one commonly used atmospheric density model (DTM2000) in terms of mean absolute percentage error (by 113.30\% and 130.64\%, respectively). The POD accelerometry method is comparable, albeit slightly worse, than two other models: JB2008 (-8.74\%) and NRLMSISE-00 (-22.74\%). These results highlight the potential for near-real-time density inversion to rival models driven by post-processed indices, which outperform these same models in an operational setting, where they rely on forecasted or nowcasted indices.
  By applying the POD accelerometry method along the orbits of three LEO satellite orbits during 80 geomagnetic storms (2001--2024), this study illustrates the potential of POD accelerometry as a near-real-time resource for the thermosphere and satellite operations community. The accompanying codebase facilitates broader adoption of these techniques, advancing both storm-time modelling and operational response capabilities.</description>
