      <title>Integrating LLM-Generated Views into Mean-Variance Optimization Using the Black-Litterman Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization faces challenges due to the sensitivity in traditional mean-variance models. The Black-Litterman model mitigates this by integrating investor views, but defining these views remains difficult. This study explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) generated views into portfolio optimization using the Black-Litterman framework. Our method leverages LLMs to estimate expected stock returns from historical prices and company metadata, incorporating uncertainty through the variance in predictions. We conduct a backtest of the LLM-optimized portfolios from June 2024 to February 2025, rebalancing biweekly using the previous two weeks of price data. As baselines, we compare against the S&amp;P 500, an equal-weighted portfolio, and a traditional mean-variance optimized portfolio constructed using the same set of stocks. Empirical results suggest that different LLMs exhibit varying levels of predictive optimism and confidence stability, which impact portfolio performance.

      <title>Beating the Correlation Breakdown: Robust Inference, Flexible Scenarios, and Stress Testing for Financial Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We live in a multivariate world, and effective modeling of financial portfolios, including their construction, allocation, forecasting, and risk analysis, simply is not possible without explicitly modeling the dependence structure of their assets. Dependence structure can drive portfolio results more than many other parameters in investment and risk models, sometimes even more than their combined effects, but the literature provides relatively little to define the finite-sample distributions of dependence measures in useable and useful ways under challenging, real-world financial data conditions. Yet this is exactly what is needed to make valid inferences about their estimates, and to use these inferences for a myriad of essential purposes, such as hypothesis testing, dynamic monitoring, realistic and granular scenario and reverse scenario analyses, and mitigating the effects of correlation breakdowns during market upheavals (which is when we need valid inferences the most). This work develops a new and straightforward method, Nonparametric Angles-based Correlation (NAbC), for defining the finite-sample distributions of any dependence measure whose matrix of pairwise associations is positive definite (e.g. Pearsons, Kendalls Tau, Spearmans Rho, Chatterjees, Lancasters, Szekelys, and their many variants). The solution remains valid under marginal asset distributions characterized by notably different and varying degrees of serial correlation, non-stationarity, heavy-tailedness, and asymmetry. Notably, NAbCs p-values and confidence intervals remain analytically consistent at both the matrix level and the pairwise cell level. Finally, NAbC maintains validity even when selected cells in the matrix are frozen for a given scenario or stress test, that is, unaffected by the scenario, thus enabling flexible, granular, and realistic scenarios.</description>
