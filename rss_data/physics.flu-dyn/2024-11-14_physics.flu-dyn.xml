      <title>Routes to stratified turbulence and temporal intermittency revealed by a cluster-based network model of experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling fluid turbulence using a `skeleton' of coherent structures has traditionally progressed by focusing on a few canonical laboratory experiments such as pipe flow and Taylor-Couette flow. We here consider the stratified inclined duct, a sustained shear flow whose density stratification allows for the exploration of a wealth of new coherent and intermittent states at significantly higher Reynolds numbers than in unstratified flows. We automatically identify the underlying turbulent skeleton of this experiment with a data-driven method combining dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering of shadowgraph visualisations. We demonstrate the existence of multiple types of turbulence across parameter space and intermittent cycling between them, revealing distinct transition pathways. With a cluster-based network model of intermittency we uncover patterns in the transition probabilities and residence times under increasing levels of turbulent dissipation. Our method and results pave the way for new reduced-order models of multi-physics turbulence.</description>

      <title>Energy and entropy conserving compatible finite elements with upwinding for the thermal shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a new compatible finite element formulation of the thermal shallow water equations that conserves energy and mathematical entropies given by buoyancy-related quadratic tracer variances. Our approach relies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous approximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time integration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The proposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes, monotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The fully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level. The ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and upwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally unstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different transient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability where including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations while successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy. The second is a double vortex where a constrained fully discrete formulation is shown to achieve exact entropy conservation in time.</description>

      <title>Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics with Application to Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in science and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of freedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control, optimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an enhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric reduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy Identification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the original GILD approach. This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the quadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be reformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions lead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the conjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD achieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to GILD's steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and iteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model predictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring controlled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and learning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated through its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the flow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven cylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD's ability to treat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Complementary Soft and Hard Constraints for Solving Complex Boundary Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft- and hard-constrained Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have achieved great success in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these methods still face great challenges when solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with complex boundary conditions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel complementary scheme combining soft and hard constraint PINN methods. The soft-constrained part is thus formulated to obtain the preliminary results with a lighter training burden, upon which refined results are then achieved using a more sophisticated hard-constrained mechanism with a primary network and a distance metric network. Specifically, the soft-constrained part focuses on boundary points, while the primary network emphasizes inner domain points, primarily through PDE loss. Additionally, the novel distance metric network is proposed to predict the power function of the distance from a point to the boundaries, which serves as the weighting factor for the first two components. This approach ensures accurate predictions for both boundary and inner domain areas. The effectiveness of the proposed method on the NSEs problem with complex boundary conditions is demonstrated by solving a 2D cylinder wake problem and a 2D blocked cavity flow with a segmented inlet problem, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to traditional soft- and hard-constrained PINN approaches. Given PINN's inherent advantages in solving the inverse and the large-scale problems, which are challenging for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, this approach holds promise for the inverse design of required flow fields by specifically-designed boundary conditions and the reconstruction of large-scale flow fields by adding a limited number of training input points. The code for our approach will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Leidenfrost drop dynamics: An approach to follow the complete evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model to follow the complete evolution of a drop in Leidenfrost state is presented in this work. The main ingredients of the phenomenon were considered, including: 1) the shape and weight of a sessile drop, according to its size, compared to the capillary length, using the Young-Laplace equation; 2) the evaporation at the entire surface of the drop, due to the heat transfer across the vapor film, to the proximitiy of a hot plate and to the diffusion in air; 3) the velocity, pressure and temperature fields at the vapor film, between the drop and the hot plate, which are recovered by means of a Hankel transform method, being valid for any size of drops and any thickness of vapor films (below the vapor film stability threshold); 4) an estimation of the thermo-capillary Marangoni convection flow, without simulating numerically the flow within the drop. The aforementioned features were addressed and calculated, in order to include their effect within a single non-linear ODE, describing the temporal evolution of the size of the drop, through the Bond number. Three dimensionless parameters, relating the thermophysical properties of the drop fluid and the surrounding air, control the development of the phenomenon. All those properties were calculated according to the ideal gas approximation and to widely used empirical correlations, without any fitting parameter. The model predictions were compared against experimental results, using different organic and inorganic compounds, for which a good agreement has been found, when no bounce or rotation of the drop spontaneously occurs.</description>

      <title>On the Drag Coefficient Universality of a Rough Grain in Creeping Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controversy exists regarding whether grain morphology reduces or enhances the drag of a single grain in creeping flows; further complication occurs when orientation dependence for aspherical grains comes into play. To quantify influences of shape irregularity and orientation, this study numerically investigates the drag in creeping flows for fractally rough grains depicted by Spherical Harmonics. As the grain surface becomes more angular with increasing relative roughness and fractal dimension, a stronger drag reduction is observed; this observed morphology-dependent reduction indicates Stokes formula is insufficient. The rotational dependence helps to explain the paradox wherein drag enhancement is always encountered insettling-grain experiments popular in geophysics. For the drag of a given rough grain at various orientations, extracted distributions of the overall drag, and its two components, i.e., skin friction and pressure drag, universally adhere to the Weibull patterns. Moreover, we identify a universal power law between drag coefficients and a newly proposed area-related number, sufficiently taking into consideration both grain roughness by surface area and orientational dependence by projected area perpendicular to the flow direction. This law is primarily controlled by relative roughness, with less sensitivity to fractal dimension. The determined expression enables precise estimation of fluid-particle interactions in upscaling simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of a New Ginzburg-Landau Reduced-Order Model for Vortex Shedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex shedding is an important physical phenomenon observed across many spatial and temporal scales in fluids. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have established a hierarchy of local and global reduced-order models for vortex shedding based on the Stuart-Landau and Ginzburg-Landau equations. In this work, we employ data-driven methods to discover a new Landau variable for the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) for periodic two-dimensional vortex shedding past a cylinder. We first coarse grain vorticity field data from direct numerical simulations of the fluid by integrating over the vertical spatial dimension, and then time-delay embed this new variable to obtain phase information necessary for CGLE analysis. Finally, we use the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to learn an interpretable system of coupled real partial differential equations that balance model complexity and prediction error. We develop local homogeneous models in key regions of the wake, as well as global heterogeneous models that are parameterized by the streamwise coordinate across the entire wake. After computing the normal-form parameters from the discovered equations, we classify the different models and determine behavior and stability in the different regions of the wake, demonstrating the validity of these models across a range of spatiotemporal subdomains. Different dynamics are found to dominate at different stations within the wake. In addition to introducing a novel Landau variable for vortex shedding, this work may also help characterize other vortex shedding systems and inform the design of control schemes.</description>

      <title>Large-scale self-organisation in dry turbulent atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How turbulent convective fluctuations organise to form large-scale structures in planetary atmospheres remains a question that eludes quantitative answers. The assumption that this process is the result of an inverse cascade was suggested half a century ago in two-dimensional fluids, but its applicability to atmospheric and oceanic flows remains heavily debated, hampering our understanding of the energy balance in planetary systems. We show with direct numerical simulations of spatial resolutions of 122882 $\times$ 384 points that rotating and stratified flows can support a bidirectional cascade of energy, in three dimensions, with a ratio of Rossby to Froude numbers comparable to that of the Earth's atmosphere. Our results establish that in dry atmospheres spontaneous order can arise via an inverse cascade to the largest spatial scales.</description>

      <title>LES-FGM modelling of non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames including preferential diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabulated chemistry methods are a well-known strategy to efficiently store the flows thermochemical properties. In particular, the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) is a widely used technique that generates the database with a small number of control variables. In order to build such a manifold, these coordinates must be monotonic in space and time. However, the high diffusivity of hydrogen can prevent such requisite.
  To avoid the non-monotonicity of control variables (the progress variable, in particular), one practical workaround is to perform the tabulation on zero-dimensional (0D) reactors rather than on one-dimensional (1D) flamelets. Various works already implemented and tested such 0D-based manifold, but mainly in the context of spray engines, where most of the composition is lean and information past the flammability limit is not relevant. The present work aims at investigating, for the first time, the applicability of a tabulation based on homogeneous reactors to study auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen jets.
  It is shown that a combined use of homogeneous reactors at the lean side and an extrapolation with 1D flamelets on the richer side is required to capture both chemistry and diffusive effects accurately in pure hydrogen flames. Then, this manifold is coupled to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of three-dimensional turbulent mixing layers and evaluated against direct numerical simulation with detailed chemistry. Good agreement is found, in terms of both ignition delay and the following steady-state burning process. Further analyses are carried out on statistics and modelling. In particular, the sensitivity of the LES solution to filter width, turbulence-chemistry interaction and multidimensional flame effects is investigated to provide new relevant insights on modelling non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames.</description>

      <title>D-shaped body wake control through flexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the flow around a canonical blunt body, specifically a D-shaped body of width $D$, in a closed water channel. Our goal is to explore near-wake flow modifications when a series of rigid and flexible plates ($l=1.8D$) divided into filaments ($h=0.2D$) are added. We focus on assessing the interaction between the flexible filaments and the wake dynamics, with the aim of reducing the recirculation bubble and decreasing the velocity deficit in the wake. To achieve this, we conduct a comparative study varying the stiffness and position of the filaments at different flow velocities. The study combines Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in the wake behind the body with recordings of the deformation of the flexible filaments. Our observations show that the flexible filaments can passively reconfigure in a two-dimensional fashion, with a mean tip deflection angle that increases with the incoming flow velocity. Deflection angles up to approximately $\sim 9^\circ$ and vibration tip amplitude of around $\sim 4^\circ$ are achieved for flow velocities $U^{*}\simeq f_{n}D/u_{\infty}\geq 1.77$, where $f_n$ is the natural frequency of the flexible filaments. This reconfiguration results in a reduction of the recirculation bubble and a decrease in the velocity deficit in the wake compared to the reference and rigid cases. In addition, curved filaments with a prescribed rigid deformation exhibit very similar behavior to that of flexible filaments, indicating that the vibration of flexible filaments does not significantly disturb the wake. The obtained results highlight the interest of testing flexible appendages in the wake of blunt bodies for designing effective flow control devices.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer in a planer diverging channel with a slot jet inlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delves into a numerical exploration of two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar flow within a confined diverging jet. The study aims to understand how variations in the inlet opening fraction and Reynolds number affect the heat transfer and flow patterns. The research employs the finite volume method with a collocated mesh to solve the governing equations. Across a broad spectrum of inlet opening fractions (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) and Reynolds numbers (ranging from 500 to 900), the findings reveal that increasing the inlet opening fraction of the jet in the diverging channel can lead to a remarkable (53%) improvement in heat transfer while simultaneously reducing pressure loss by 90%. This outcome holds the potential to conserve energy by requiring less pumping power. Notably, this investigation is pioneering and offers novel and valuable insights into enhancing heat transfer through the utilization of a diverging channel.</description>

      <title>Drop impact onto a heated surface in a depressurized environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of a droplet on a heated surface in a depressurized environment, with a particular focus on the unique outcome observed under these conditions: magic carpet breakup. This phenomenon, first reported by Hatakenaka et al. [Int. J. Heat Mass Transf., 145, 118729(2019)], describes an explosive, widespread rebound of the drop. A newly-developed thin-film Fe-Ni thermocouple array with $20~\mathrm{nm}$ thick layers unveiled surface temperature during the magic carpet breakup. This high-speed surface temperature measurement was synchronized with total internal reflection (TIR) imaging. The bubble growth and the subsequent pressure release eventually led to an explosive rebound of the drop. The bubble grew almost linearly with a slight acceleration, significantly different from the asymptotic growth observed for the bubble on a superheated substrate in a liquid pool. The growth rate remained low even when the surface was superheated to delta T = 60 K, but it increased sharply afterward. The surface temperature decreased sharply as the measuring junction became wet but did not recover immediately after the ring-shaped contact region passed. Remarkably, the study captured liquid microdroplets forming at the receding contact line of a growing bubble via a side-view camera and TIR. The surface temperature remained relatively low due to the evaporation of microdroplets. The threshold for microdroplet formation is related to the bubble growth rate.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fluid-dynamical systems met in nature are quasi-two-dimensional: they are constrained to evolve in approximately two dimensions with little or no variation along the third direction. This has a drastic effect in the flow evolution because the properties of three dimensional turbulence are fundamentally different from those of two dimensional turbulence. In three-dimensions energy is transferred on average towards small scales, while in two dimensions energy is transferred towards large scales. Quasi-two-dimensional flows thus stand in a crossroad, with two-dimensional motions attempting to self-organize and generate large scales while three dimensional perturbations cause disorder, disrupting any large scale organization. Where is energy transferred in such systems? It has been realized recently that in fact the two behaviors can coexist with a simultaneous transfer of energy both to large and to small scales. How the cascade properties change as the variations along the third direction are suppressed has lead to discovery of different regimes or phases of turbulence of unexpected richness in behavior. Here, recent discoveries on such systems are reviewed. It is described how the transition from three-dimensional to two-dimensional flows takes place, the different phases of turbulence met and the nature of the transitions from one phase to the other. Finally, the implications these new discoveries have on different physical systems are discussed.</description>

The droplet bag breakup problem is of significance for many multiphase processes in scientific and engineering applications. Turbulent fluctuations are introduced synthetically into a mean flow, and the droplet is inserted when the air-phase turbulence reaches a statistically stationary state. The morphological evolution of the droplet under different turbulence configurations is retrieved and analysed in comparison with laminar aerobreakup results. It is found that while the detailed evolution history of individual droplets varies widely between different realisations of the turbulent flow, common dynamic and morphological evolution patterns are observed. The presence of turbulence is found to enhance the drag coefficient of the droplet as it flattens. At late times, the droplet becomes tilted and increasingly corrugated under strong turbulence intensity. We quantify these phenomena and discuss their possible governing mechanisms associated with turbulence intermittency. Lastly, the influences of liquid-gas viscosity ratio are examined and the implications of air-phase turbulence on the later bag film breakup process are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Function Learning: A sparse aerodynamic data reconstruction method for generalizing aircraft shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and complete aerodynamic data sets are the basis for comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the overall performance of aircraft. However, the sampling cost of full-state aerodynamic data is extremely high, and there are often differences between wind tunnel conditions and actual flight conditions. Conventional scaling parameter extraction methods can solve the problem of aerodynamic state extrapolation, but hard to achieve data migration and shape generalization. In order to realize the low-cost construction of a full-state nonlinear aerodynamic database, this research proposes the Scaling Function Learning (SFL) method. In SFL method, symbolic regression is used to mine the composite function expression of aerodynamic force coefficient for a relatively complete aerodynamic data set of typical aircraft. The inner layer of the function represents a scaling function. The SFL method was validated on the HB-2 by extracting scaling parameters for axial force coefficients and generalizing the scaling function by releasing its constants. The effectiveness and accuracy of the scaling function are verified using different hypersonic aircraft configurations, such as HBS, double ellipsoid, sharp cone, and double cone missile. The results show that the extracted scaling function has the ability to generalize across states and configurations. With only 3-4 state samples, the aerodynamic database construction of variable Mach number, angle of attack and Reynolds number can be realized, which shows great state extrapolation ability with a relative error of about 1-5%. This research also lays a methodological foundation for parameter space dimensionality reduction and small sample modeling of other complex high-dimensional engineering problems.</description>

      <title>incompressibleFoam: a new time consistent framework with BDF and DIRK integration schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the development of a new incompressible solver, within OpenFOAM, that incorporates several numerical methods. Two momentum interpolation (MI) methods are implemented as well as two forms of the pressure Poisson equation. Regarding the time discretization, backward differentiation and Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (SDIRK), up to the third order, are coded. The solver is tested against three test cases to assess the performance of different numerical configurations. The results are also compared with the standard incompressible solver of OpenFOAM: pimpleFoam. The results allow us to put into perspective previous attempts to improve OpenFOAM's incompressible solvers and give practical results regarding the choice of momentum interpolation, pressure equation form and time schemes. Finally, the source code is released in the following github repository : https://github.com/ferrop/incompressibleFoam.</description>

      <title>Internal Boundary Layer Scaling for Roughness Transitions in Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When turbulent boundary layer flows encounter abrupt roughness changes, an Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) forms. Equilibrium theory breaks down in the nonequilibrium IBL, which may extend O(10) km for natural atmospheric flows. Here, we find that the IBL possesses a characteristic time-scale associated with the IBL height, ${\delta}_i$. We show that ${\delta}_i$ and the edge velocity set the scales of the mean and defect velocity profiles within the IBL, for simulation and experimental data covering a multitude of roughness transition types. We present a nontrivial extension of equilibrium theory to the dynamically adjusting IBL, which can be useful for modeling a range of environmental and industrial flows.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Axisymmetrization and Enhanced Inviscid Damping in 2D Linearized Euler Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the mathematical theory of axisymmetrization and vorticity depletion within the two-dimensional (2D) Euler equations, with an emphasis on the dynamics of radially symmetric, monotonic vorticity profiles. By analyzing inviscid damping, we establish new optimal decay rates for radial and angular velocity components in weighted Sobolev spaces, showing that vorticity depletion enhances damping effects beyond those observed in passive scalar dynamics. Our methodology involves the construction of advanced Greens functions and the use of spectral techniques to achieve precise asymptotic expansions, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing long-term stability. These results mark the first rigorous confirmation of enhanced inviscid damping rates in axisymmetric vortices, substantially advancing the theoretical understanding of coherent vortex structures in high Reynolds number flows. This work has potential applications in fluid stability theory, turbulence modeling, and other fields that involve the study of inviscid flows.</description>

      <title>Recovering head and flux distributions at the sediment-water interface for arbitrary, transient bedforms by inversion of photographic time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works that predict bedform-induced hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) typically either assume a simplified streambed shape and corresponding sinusoidal head distribution or rely on costly computational fluid dynamics simulations. Experimental data have been lacking for the formulation of a priori prediction rules for hydraulic head and flux distributions induced by spatiotemporally heterogeneous natural bedforms because it has not previously been feasible to determine these in the laboratory. We address this problem, presenting a noninvasive technique for regularized inversion of photographic time series of dye front propagation in the hyporheic zone, compatible with arbitrarily-shaped, generally transient bedforms. We employ the technique to analyze three bench-scale flume experiments performed under different flow regimes, presenting a new data set of digitized bed profiles, corresponding head distributions, and dye fronts. To our knowledge, this is the first such data set collated for naturally-formed sand bedforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence in a Three-Dimensional Holographic Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report real-time simulations of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of a holographic superfluid in three dimensions. The holographic duality maps a strongly coupled superfluid to a weakly coupled theory with gravity in a higher-dimensional curved space which we study numerically. Starting from configurations of dense tangles of quantized vortex lines, the superfluid exhibits turbulent behavior during its evolution towards thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we observe two subsequent universal regimes of quasi-stationary scaling in the occupation number spectrum, the first of which is Kolmogorov-like. Indications for the strongly dissipative nature of vortex dynamics in the three-dimensional holographic superfluid are found in the rapid shrinking and annihilation of small vortex rings that emerge from frequent reconnections of vortex lines during the evolution.</description>

      <title>Electrohydrodynamic flow about a colloidal particle suspended in a non-polar fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, where electrically driven fluid flows depend nonlinearly on the applied voltage, are commonly encountered in aqueous suspensions of colloidal particles. A prime example is the induced-charge electro-osmosis, driven by an electric field acting on diffuse charge induced near a polarizable surface. Nonlinear electrohydrodynamic flows also occur in non-polar fluids, driven by the electric field acting on space charge induced by conductivity gradients. Here, we analyze the flows about a charge-neutral spherical solid particle in an applied uniform electric field that arise from conductivity dependence on local field intensity. The flow pattern varies with particle conductivity: while the flow about a conducting particle has a quadrupolar pattern similar to induced-charge electro-osmosis albeit with opposite direction, the flow about an insulating particle has a more complex structure. We find that this flow induces a force on a particle near an electrode that varies non-trivially with particle conductivity: while it is repulsive for perfectly insulating particle and particles more conductive than the suspending medium, there exists a range of particle conductivities where the force is attractive. The force decays as inverse square of the distance to the electrode and thus can dominate the dielectrophoretic attraction due to the image dipole, which falls off with the fourth power with the distance. This electrohydrodynamic lift opens new possibilities for colloidal manipulation and driven assembly by electric fields.</description>

      <title>Combustion Instabilities in Complex Chamber Geometries of Solid Propellant Rocket Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency combustion instabilities can lead to significant fluctuations in chamber pressure, affecting the structural integrity and performance of solid rocket motors. Since these instabilities manifest as acoustic oscillations during combustion, a mathematical model has been developed to calculate the chamber modes, providing an accurate method for predicting the acoustic behaviour of the combustion chamber. A novel method for discretising the Laplacian operator is introduced, which allows the calculation of the acoustic modes of complex chamber geometries. This approach uses an efficient numerical algorithm designed for unstructured mesh configurations. Several computational examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the model to complex geometries typical of solid rocket motors. In addition, an analytical procedure is developed in these examples to aid the design process, providing engineers with critical data to optimise the stability and performance of propulsion systems. This research provides valuable insights into the analysis of combustion instabilities, with broad implications for the design and optimisation of propulsion systems in aerospace engineering.</description>

      <title>Flow reconstruction in time-varying geometries using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a Graph Attention Convolutional Network (GACN) for flow reconstruction from very sparse data in time-varying geometries. The model incorporates a feature propagation algorithm as a preprocessing step to handle extremely sparse inputs, leveraging information from neighboring nodes to initialize missing features. In addition, a binary indicator is introduced as a validity mask to distinguish between the original and propagated data points, enabling more effective learning from sparse inputs. Trained on a unique data set of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a motored engine at a technically relevant operating condition, the GACN shows robust performance across different resolutions and domain sizes and can effectively handle unstructured data and variable input sizes. The model is tested on previously unseen DNS data as well as on an experimental data set from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements that were not considered during training. A comparative analysis shows that the GACN consistently outperforms both a conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and cubic interpolation methods on the DNS and PIV test sets by achieving lower reconstruction errors and better capturing fine-scale turbulent structures. In particular, the GACN effectively reconstructs flow fields from domains up to 14 times larger than those observed during training, with the performance advantage increasing for larger domains.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation, combining numerical simulations and experimental measurements, into the manipulation of water waves and resonance characteristics within closed cavities utilizing anisotropic metamaterials. We engineer the anisotropic media with subwavelength-scale layered bathymetry through the application of coordinate transformation theory and the homogenization technique to a fully three-dimensional linear water wave problem. Experimental and numerical analyses of deformed cavities employing anisotropic metamaterial bathymetry demonstrate regular sloshing mode patterns and eigenfrequencies akin to those observed in rectangular reference cavities with flat bathymetry. Our study underscores the potential of water wave metamaterials in establishing robust anisotropic metabathymetry for the precise control of sloshing modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>
