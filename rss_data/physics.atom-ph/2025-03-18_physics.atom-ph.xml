      <title>Micromotion compensation using dark and bright ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stray electric fields induce excess micromotion in ion traps, limiting experimental performance. We present a new micromotion-compensation technique that utilizes a dark ion in a bright-dark-bright linear ion crystal. Stray electric fields in the radial plane of the trap deform the crystal axially. We exploit the mode softening near the transition to the zig-zag configuration to increase our sensitivity dramatically. We corroborate our results with a modified ion-displacement compensation method using a single bright ion. Our modification allows us to compensate stray fields on the 2D radial plane from a 1D measurement of the ion position on the camera. Both methods require only a fixed imaging camera and continuous ion-fluorescence detection. As such, they can be readily implemented in virtually any ion-trapping experiment without additional hardware modifications.</description>

      <title>Properties of a definition of the SI second based on several optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current definition of the SI second based on the Cs ground state hyperfine transition is expected to be replaced by a new definition based on optical frequency standards in the next decade. Several options are currently under consideration for the new definition, including a definition based on the weighted geometric mean of several transitions. In this paper, we review several properties of this option, and most notably introduce a quantitative method to set the weights of transitions, and a graphical representation of the unit that make the distinction between the definition and the realisation of the unit easier to understand.</description>

      <title>Probing Instantaneous Single-Molecule Chirality in the Planar Ground State of Formic Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that individual molecules of formic acid are chiral even when they are in the vibrational ground state, which has a planar equilibrium structure. We ionize the C 1s shell of the molecule and record the photoelectron in coincidence with positively charged fragments. This provides two consecutive measurements of the molecular structure, the first by photoelectron diffraction imaging and the second by Coulomb explosion imaging. We find that both measurements show the same handedness of the specific molecule. The phenomenon of being achiral on average but chiral on the level of individual molecules is general to prochiral molecules and is a consequence of the three-dimensional zero-point delocalization of the nuclei in the vibrational ground state.</description>

      <title>A spinless crystal for a high-performance solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state $^{229}$Th nuclear clocks require a host material whose band gap is larger than the 8.4 eV nuclear transition energy. As such, excitation of the $^{229}$Th nuclear state has so far only been demonstrated in metal fluorides, specifically CaF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, and ThF$_4$, where the large electronegativity of the halogen leads to sufficient band gaps. However, it is expected that the nuclear magnetic moment of the fluorine gives rise to a leading order broadening mechanism that limits the clock stability. Here, we use concepts of molecular design to identify a polyatomic anion, SO$_4^{2-}$, that is both nuclear spin free and of sufficient electron affinity to result in a high band gap metal sulfate system. Using state-of-the-art calculations, we find that the band gap of Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ is approximately 9 eV, large enough for direct laser excitation of $^{229}$Th. Low concentrations of $^{229}$Th in the otherwise spinless $^{232}$Th(SO$_4$)$_2$ crystal mitigate $^{229}$Th-$^{229}$Th interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of $^{229}$Th does not modify the material band gap nor introduce electronic states associated with nuclear quenching. By removing one of the primary sources of nuclear line broadening in the crystal, the nuclear magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, a nuclear clock with instability as low as $\sigma = 4.6\times10^{-23}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where ${\tau}$ is the averaging time, may be realized. This is roughly six orders of magnitude lower than previously thought possible.</description>

      <title>The Sensitivity Limit of Rydberg Electrometry via Fisher-Information-Optimized Slope Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the Fisher information and sensitivity of a Rydberg-atom-based microwave-field electrometer within the framework of slope detection. Instead of focusing on the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectrum of the probe laser, we shift the analytical focus to the transmitted power response to the signal microwave to be measured. Through meticulous analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in transmitted light power, we naturally derive the desired sensitivity. Crucially, we demonstrate that laser-intrinsic noise, rather than the relaxation of the atomic system, predominantly governs the uncertainty in microwave measurement. Based on this, the Fisher information, which characterizes the precision limit of microwave measurement, is deduced. Considering only non-technical relaxation processes and excluding controllable technical relaxations, the optimal sensing conditions are numerically analyzed from the perspective of maximizing the Fisher information. The results reveal that the sensitivity of the electrometer under such conditions can reach sub-$\mathrm{nV}/(\mathrm{cm}\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}})$. Our work provides a rigorous quantitative characterization of the performance of the Rydberg-atom-based microwave-field electrometer and presents an effective strategy for optimizing its performance.</description>

      <title>Tunable N-level EIT: Deterministic Generation of Optical States with Negative Wigner Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\% to 250\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.</description>

      <title>Probing the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped BEC with collective excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</description>

      <title>On the electrons really contributing to dc conductivity of warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic properties of warm dense matter is an active field of research. Understanding transport properties of these states is essential for providing coefficients needed by magneto-radiative hydrodynamics codes for many studies, including hydrodynamic instabilities, energy balances or heating in fusion plasmas, difficult to investigate by experimental means. In this paper, we present an average-atom approach for the calculation of direct-current electric conductivity within Ziman's theory. The mean ion charge $Z^*$, commonly called ionization, is an important input of the Ziman formula, but is not clearly defined within average-atom models. Our study spans a wide range of thermodynamical conditions, i.e., for the densities, from a few $10^{-2}$ to about 4 times the solid's density, and, for the temperatures, typically from 0.1 eV to 700 eV, favorable to large differences in the mean ion charge $Z^*$ according to its definition. We compare and discuss different ways of defining $Z^*$ while trying to figure out which electrons really contribute to electric conduction. We compare our results with experimental data and published theoretical values, in particular from the second transport code comparison workshop, which was held in July 2023 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. These comparisons lead us to propose indicators for the relevance of including different charges predicted by our average-atom model in the definition of $Z^*$.</description>

      <title>Three-body Physics in the Impurity Limit of 39K Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</description>

Abstract: A new calibration method for H-fs-TALIF is proposed, and the ratio of two-photon absorption cross-sections, $\sigma^{(2)}$, for atomic hydrogen (H) and krypton (Kr) is determined for the broadband emission of a femtosecond laser system. The estimated ratio of the two-photon absorption cross-sections for H and Kr is $\sigma^{(2)}$ for H and Kr $\sigma^{(2)}$(Kr)/$\sigma^{(2)}$(H) = $0.027\pm 20$%, which is nearly twenty times lower than values previously obtained with narrowband nanosecond lasers. This discrepancy highlights the need for independent calibration of TALIF measurements for a specific laser pulsewidth range.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Borde atom interferometry with a thermal strontium beam for a compact optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Precision measurements of muonium and muonic helium hyperfine structure at J-PARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the J-PARC Muon Science Facility (MUSE), the MuSEUM collaboration is now performing new precision measurements of the ground state hyperfine structure (HFS) of both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-precision measurements of the muonium ground-state HFS are recognized as one of the most sensitive tools for testing bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory to precisely probe the standard model and determine fundamental constants of the positive muon magnetic moment and mass. The same technique can also be employed to measure muonic helium HFS, obtain the negative muon magnetic moment and mass, and test and improve the theory of the three-body atomic system. Measurements at zero magnetic field have already yielded more accurate results than previous experiments for both muonium and muonic helium atoms. High-field measurements are now ready to start collecting data using the world's most intense pulsed muon beam at the MUSE H-line. We aim to improve the precision of previous measurements ten times for muonium and a hundred times or more for muonic helium. We review all the key developments for these new measurements, focusing on the high-field experiment, and report the latest results and prospects.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present expressions for the full effective potential corresponding to the one-photon exchange interaction within the framework of an effective Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics. The final effective potential is expressed in terms of eight scalar functions. When these eight scalar functions are expanded in terms of velocities order by order, we can return to the non-relativistic effective potential systematically organized by velocities. By retaining the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential, we estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. The comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using conventional bound-state perturbative theory is discussed. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extend these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and scenarios involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number non-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and discuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong light fields with the potential application in ultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an important step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy methods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and those of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent one-dimensional quantum droplets across the mean-field stability regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>
