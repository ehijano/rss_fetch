      <title>A Lee-Huang-Yang type expansion for the thermodynamic energy density of a dilute mixture of Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dilute gas in 3D composed of two species of bosons interacting through positive inter-species and intra-species pairwise potentials. We prove a second order expansion for the energy density in the thermodynamic limit. For the case of compactly supported, integrable potentials, we derive the correct second order of the expansion. If we make the further assumption of having soft potentials, we also derive the correct coefficient of the second order and the resulting formula is coherent with the physics literature. If we let the density and scattering length of one of the species go to zero, we obtain the Lee-Huang-Yang formula for one species of bosons. The paper also contains a proof of BEC for a mixture of bosons in a box with length scale larger than the Gross-Pitaevskii one.</description>

      <title>Universal cumulants and conformal invariance in annihilating random walks with pair deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider annihilating random walks on the finite one-dimensional integer torus with deposition of pairs of particles, conditioned on an atypical jump activity. All cumulants of the activity, defined as the number of particle jumps up to some time t, are obtained in closed form to leading order in system size L at the critical point, where in the thermodynamic limit the conditioned process undergoes a phase transition in the universality class of the one-dimensional quantum Ising model in a transverse field. The generating function of the cumulants at a distance of order 1/L away from the critical point is proved to be given by two universal quantities, viz., by the central charge c = 1/2 of the Virasoro algebra that characterizes the Ising universality class and by an explicit universal scaling function.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of star central configurations in the $5$-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a rigorous analytical proof of the uniqueness of central configurations for the five-body problem, assuming that all five masses are equal and positioned at the vertices of a planar polygon. We consider configurations in which the bodies are equally spaced in angular position relative to the center of mass, and aim to determine whether a central configuration arises under these constraints. We prove that the only central configuration that satisfies these conditions occurs when the five bodies form a regular pentagon. Our approach is entirely analytical, relying on algebraic techniques rather than numerical approximations. By transforming the governing equations into a reduced system involving only two variables, we analyze the solution space over a significant and carefully bounded domain. This domain is divided into sixteen disjoint regions, within which we rule out additional solutions through explicit algebraic arguments. Our results confirm that the regular pentagonal configuration is the only central configuration in this symmetric five-body scenario.</description>

      <title>Hypoellipticity of the Asymptotic Bismut Superconnection on Contact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a contact sub-Riemannian manifold, one obtains a non-integrable splitting of the tangent bundle into the directions along the contact distribution and the Reeb field. We generalize the construction of the Bismut superconnection to this non-integrable setting and show that although singularities appear within the superconnection, if one extracts the finite part then the resulting operator is hypoelliptic. We then discuss the explicit form of the operator on principal $\bS^1$-bundles and discuss possible directions for generalizations and open questions; in particular, a possible relationship between our hypoelliptic operator and a constrained supersymmetric sigma model.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the time-dependent free Schr\"odinger operator by the Galilei invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent free Schr\"odinger operator is shown to be characterized as the only linear partial differential operator of the second order that is invariant under the Galilei group in the Euclidean space-time $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^n$. The method of proof depends on the analysis of the invariance of polynomials given by the application of the linear partial differential operators to monochromatic plane waves under space rotations and pure Galilei transformations.</description>

      <title>Generalized bulk-interface correspondence for non-quantized spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for a generalized bulk-interface correspondence (BIC) in electronic systems with possibly nonconserved spin charge, where the Hamiltonian and spin operator do not commute. We first introduce the bulk spin conductance as a character of the bulk medium, which is defined as a potential-current correlation function and is not quantized if the spin charge is nonconserved. Then we establish the principle of BIC, which states that the difference of bulk spin conductances across an interface equals the sum of two quantities associated with the spin transport along the interface: the spin-drift conductance, which captures spin transport carried by interface modes, and the spin-torque conductance, which accounts for spin generation near the interface due to the non-conservation of spin. Furthermore, when the spin charge is conserved, our result recovers the existing BIC based on the spin Chern number or Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index. Our findings demonstrate that the principle of BIC is not restricted to systems with quantized characters and provides new insights into spin transport phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the relation between spin-systems and Fermi-systems on the lattice we construct for a spin-system with dimension d an algebra for which quasifree time-evolutions exist. With appropriate assumptions the gauge invariant subalgebra common for both algebras is invariant under this time-evolution and on this subalgebra is norm-asymptotically abelian.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue Component of Semiclassical Measures for Abelian Quantum Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a large class of symplectic integer matrices, the action on the torus extends to a symplectic $\mathbb{Z}^r$-action with $r\geq 2$. We apply this to the study of semiclassical measures for joint eigenfunctions of the quantization of the symplectic matrices of the $\mathbb{Z}^r$-action. In the irreducible setting, we prove that the resulting probability measures are convex combinations of the Lebesgue measure with weight $\geq 1/2$ and a zero entropy measure. We also provide a general theorem in the reducible case showing that the Lebesgue components along isotropic and symplectic invariant subtori must have total weight $\geq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic approximation for equations of discrete turbulence in the subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a damped/driven cubic NLS equation on a torus under the limit when first the amplitude of solutions goes to zero and then the period of the torus goes to infinity. We suggest another proof of the kinetic approximation for the energy spectrum under a subcritical scaling, extending to the exact solutions result obtained in [Dymov, Kuksin, Maiocchi, Vladuts '2023] for quasisolutions which were defined as the second order truncations of decompositions for the solutions in amplitude. The proof does not involve Feynman diagrams, instead relying on a robust inductive analysis of cumulants.</description>

      <title>The Darboux Classification of Curl Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle dynamics under curl forces. These forces are a class of non-conservative, non-dissipative, position-dependent forces that cannot be expressed as gradient of a potential function. We show that the fundamental quantity of particle dynamics under curl forces is a work $1$-form. By using the Darboux classification of differential $1$-forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish that any curl force in two dimensions has at most two generalized potentials, while in three dimensions, it has at most three. These potentials generalize the single potential of conservative systems. For any curl force field, we introduce a corresponding conservative force field -- the conservative auxiliary force. The Hamiltonian of this conservative force is a conserved quantity of motion for the dynamics of a particle under the curl force, although it is not the physical energy.</description>

      <title>On geometric spectral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spectral functionals associated with Dirac and Laplace-type differential operators on manifolds, defined via the Wodzicki residue, extending classical results for Dirac operators derived from the Levi-Civita connection to geometries with torsion. The local densities of these functionals recover fundamental geometric tensors, including the volume form, Riemannian metric, scalar curvature, Einstein tensor, and torsion tensor. Additionally, we introduce chiral spectral functionals using a grading operator, which yields novel spectral invariants. These constructions offer a richer spectral-geometric characterization of manifolds.</description>

      <title>Universal estimates for the density of states for aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spectral properties of aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems in one dimension, with a primary focus on the density of states. We prove that for random block configurations, as the number of blocks $M\to \infty$, the integrated density of states converges to a non-random, continuous function. We show both analytically and numerically that the density of states exhibits a tripartite decomposition: it vanishes identically within bandgaps; it forms smooth, band-like distributions in shared pass bands (a consequence of constructive eigenmode interactions); and, most notably, it exhibits a distinct fractal-like character in hybridisation regions. We demonstrate that this fractal-like behaviour stems from the limited interaction between eigenmodes within these hybridisation regions. Capitalising on this insight, we introduce an efficient meta-atom approach that enables rapid and accurate prediction of the density of states in these hybridisation regions. This approach is shown to extend to systems with quasiperiodic and hyperuniform arrangements of blocks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the partition function of the perturbed Gross-Witten-Wadia unitary matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotics of the partition function of the extended Gross-Witten-Wadia unitary matrix model by introducing an extra logarithmic term in the potential. The partition function can be written as a Toeplitz determinant with entries expressed in terms of the modified Bessel functions of the first kind and furnishes a $\tau$-function sequence of the Painlev\'e III' equation. We derive the asymptotic expansions of the Toeplitz determinant up to and including the constant terms as the size of the determinant tends to infinity. The constant terms therein are expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta-function and the Barnes $G$-function. A third-order phase transition in the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions is also observed.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometric Theory of Principal Bundle Constrained Systems: Strong Transversality Conditions and Variational Framework for Gauge Field Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric mechanics framework for constrained systems on principal bundles. Our key innovation is the development and rigorous characterization of the strong transversality condition that establishes a fundamental connection between constraint distributions and principal bundle structures through a Lie algebra dual distribution function $\lambda: P \to \mathfrak{g}^*$. We prove this condition is equivalent to a $G$-equivariant splitting of the Atiyah exact sequence. We establish the theoretical foundation by proving both existence theorems (for principal bundles satisfying $\text{ad}^*\Omega\lambda = 0$ with parallelizable base manifolds) and uniqueness theorems (for semi-simple Lie algebras with trivial centers). From variational principles, we derive the dynamic connection equation $\partial_t\omega = d^{\omega}\eta - \iota_{X_H}\Omega$, which reveals interaction mechanisms between gauge fields and matter fields in constrained systems. Our work introduces the Spencer cohomology mapping and proves its isomorphism with de Rham cohomology of the principal bundle, creating an exact correspondence between topological invariants and physical conservation laws. Through Zorn's lemma, we provide constructive proof of hierarchical fibrization, explaining topological mechanisms of constraint structure changes. The framework unifies gauge field theory and constrained mechanics, offering insights into non-ideal constraints, geometric phases, and topological invariants. Our analysis demonstrates that the strong transversality condition captures geometric effects from constraint-curvature coupling that standard approaches cannot detect. This theoretical framework opens new avenues for analyzing complex physical systems, applying to fluid dynamics and Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Large time and distance asymptotics of the one-dimensional impenetrable Bose gas and Painlev\'e IV transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the time-dependent correlation function of the one-dimensional impenetrable Bose gas, which can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm determinant of a time-dependent sine kernel and the solutions of the separated NLS equations. We derive the large time and distance asymptotic expansions of this determinant and the solutions of the separated NLS equations in both the space-like region and time-like region of the $(x,t)$-plane. Furthermore, we observe a phase transition between the asymptotic expansions in these two different regions. The phase transition is then shown to be described by a particular solution of the Painlev\'e IV equation.</description>

      <title>Many-faced Painlev\'e I: irregular conformal blocks, topological recursion, and holomorphic anomaly approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Fourier series (Zak transform) structure of the Painlev\'e I tau function has emerged in multiple contexts. Its main building block admits several conjectural interpretations, such as the partition function of an Argyres-Douglas gauge theory, the topological recursion partition function for the Weierstrass elliptic curve, and a 1-point conformal block on the Riemann sphere with an irregular insertion of rank $\frac52$. We review and further develop a mathematical framework for these constructions, and formulate conjectures on their equivalence. In particular, we give a simple explanation of the Fourier series representation of the tau function based on the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential extended to the space of Stokes data. We provide an algebraic construction of the rank $\frac52$ Whittaker state for the Virasoro algebra embedded into a rank $2$ Whittaker module, prove its existence and uniqueness, and fix its descendant structure. We also prove the conifold gap property of the relevant topological recursion partition function, which, on one hand, enables its efficient computation within the holomorphic anomaly approach and, on the other, establishes the existence of solution for the latter.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Fredholm determinant solutions of the noncommutative Painlev\'e II equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of a family of pole-free solutions to the noncommutative Painlev\'e II equation. These particular solutions can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm determinant of the matrix version of the classical Airy operator, which are analogous to the Hastings-McLeod solution and the Ablowitz-Segur solution of the classical Painlev\'e II equation. Using the Riemann-Hilbert approach, we derive the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant and the associated particular solutions $\beta(\vec{s})$ to the noncommutative Painlev\'e II equation in the regime $\vec{s}=\left(s+\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{-s}},s-\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{-s}}\right)$ with $\tau\ge 0$ and $s\to-\infty$. The solutions depend on a two by two Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues in the interval $(-1,1)$. The asymptotics are expressed in terms of one parameter family of special solutions of the classical Painlev\'e V equation. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotics, including the connection formulas, for this one parameter family of solutions of the Painlev\'e V equation both as $ix\to -\infty$ and $x\to 0$.</description>

      <title>$d$-dimensional spherical ferromagnets in random fields: Metastates, continuous symmetry breaking, and spin-glass features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-volume behavior of the spherical model for $d$-dimensional local spins, in the presence of $d$-dimensional random fields, for $d\geq 2$. We compare two models, one with volume-scaled random fields, and another one with non-scaled random fields, on the level of Aizenman-Wehr metastates, Newman-Stein metastates, as well as overlap distributions. We show that in $d\geq 2$ the metastates are fully supported on a continuity of random product states, with weights which we describe, for both models. For the non-scaled random fields, the set of a.s. cluster points of Gibbs measures contains these product states, but behaves differently in the 'recurrent' spin dimension $d=2$ where it also contains non-trivial mixtures of tilted measures. For the scaled model, moreover the overlap distribution displays spin-glass characteristics, as it is non-self averaging, and shows replica symmetry breaking, although it is ultrametric if and only if $d=1$. For $d\geq 2$ it oscillates chaotically on a set of continuous distributions for large volumes, while the limiting set contains only discrete distributions in $d=1$. Our results are based on concentration estimates, analysis of Gibbs measures in finite but large volumes, and the asymptotics of $d$-dimensional random walks and their spherical projections.</description>

      <title>Modular correspondences and replicable functions (unabridged version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landen transformation, and more generally modular correspondences, can be seen to be exact symmetries of some integrable lattice models, like the square Ising model, or the Baxter model. They are solutions of remarkable Schwarzian equations and have some compositional properties. Most of the known examples correspond, in an elliptic curves framework, to an automorphy property of pullbacked $_2F_1$ hypergeometric functions, associated with modular forms. It is, however, important to underline that these Schwarzian equations go beyond an elliptic curves, and hypergeometric functions framework. The question of a modular correspondence interpretation of the solutions of these ``Schwarzian'' equations was clearly an open question. This paper tries to shed some light on this open question. We first shed some light on the very nature of a one-parameter series solution of the Schwarzian equation. This one-parameter series is not generically a modular correspondence series, but it actually reduces to an
  infinite set of modular correspondence series for an infinite set of (N-th root of unity) values of the parameter. We also provide an example of two-parameter series, with a compositional property, solution of a Schwarzian equation. We finally provide simple pedagogical examples that are very similar to modular correspondence series, but are far beyond the elliptic curves framework. These last examples show that the modular correspondence-like series, or the nome-like series, are not necessarily globally bounded. The results of that paper can be seen as an incentive to study differentially algebraic series with integer coefficients, in physics or enumeratice combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Systems with jump-discontinuous mass. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free quantum particle in one dimension whose mass profile exhibits jump discontinuities. The corresponding Hamiltonian is realised as a self-adjoint extension of the kinetic energy operator formulated in divergence form, with the extension encoded in the boundary conditions at the mass discontinuity points. For a family of scale-free boundary conditions, we analyse the associated spectral problem. We find that the eigenfunctions exhibit a highly sensitive and erratic dependence on the energy, leading to irregular spectral behaviour. Notably, the system supports infinitely many distinct semiclassical limits, each labeled by a point on a spectral curve embedded in the two-torus. These results demonstrate a rich interplay between discontinuous coefficients, boundary data, and spectral asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On a certain class of para-Hermite Einstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A special class of (complex) para-Hermite Einstein spaces is analyzed. It is well-known that the self-dual Weyl tensor in para-Hermite Einstein spaces is of the Petrov-Penrose type [D]. In what follows we assume that the anti-self-dual Weyl tensor is algebraically degenerate. It is equivalent to the existence of an anti-self-dual congruence of null strings which is assumed not to be parallely propagated. Hence, spaces analyzed here are not Walker spaces. A classification of such spaces is given and the explicit metrics are found.</description>

      <title>Geometric formulation of $k$-essence and late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of geometries in which nonmetricity is fully determined by a vectorial degree of freedom and three independent coefficients. Formulating the simplest linear action in this geometry, implemented through Lagrange multipliers, naturally leads to an equivalence with the purely kinetic $k$-essence models with quadratic kinetic terms. A detailed dynamical systems analysis reveals that the $\Lambda$CDM phenomenology is embedded within the model. Crucially, we find that if stability conditions such as a positive sound speed squared and non-negative energy density are not enforced, the model generically exhibits instabilities and divergent behaviour in the phase space. These physical viability criteria allow us to isolate stable regions of the parameter space and derive well-motivated priors for parameter inference. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and late-time observational data, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon$^{+}$ Type Ia supernovae, and DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, we constrain the degrees of freedom associated with nonmetricity and demonstrate the viability of the model. Remarkably, the model is found to be statistically indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM at late times. We discuss the implications of these results in light of the recent cosmic tensions, and give a possible explanation as to why the equivalent $k$-essence models have been missed as serious competitors to $\Lambda$CDM in the past. Finally, we review the geometric foundations of the theory and show that the integrable Weyl, Schr\"{o}dinger and completely symmetric geometries are embedded within our framework as special cases.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium steady state for a three-mode energy cascade model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the central phenomenon of energy cascades in wave turbulence theory, we construct non-equilibrium statistical steady states (NESS), or invariant measures, for a simplified model derived from the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation with external forcing and dissipation. This new perspective to studying energy cascades, distinct from traditional analyses based on kinetic equations and their cascade spectra, focuses on the underlying statistical steady state that is expected to hold when the cascade spectra of wave turbulence manifest.
  In the full generality of the (infinite dimensional) nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, constructing such invariant measures is more involved than the rigorous justification of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra, which itself remains an outstanding open question despite the recent progress on mathematical wave turbulence. Since such complexity remains far beyond the current knowledge (even for much simpler chain models), we confine our analysis to a three-mode reduced system that captures the resonant dynamics of the NLS equation, offering a tractable framework for constructing the NESS. For this, we introduce a novel approach based on solving an elliptic Feynman-Kac equation to construct the needed Lyapunov function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the convergence of additive functionals under the determinantal point process with the confluent hypergeometric kernel, corresponding to a sufficiently smooth function $f(x/R)$, as $R\to\infty$. We show that these functionals approach Gaussian distribution and give an estimate on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. To obtain these results we derive an exact identity for expectations of multiplicative functionals in terms of Fredholm determinants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points, and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  Based on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we show that the partition functions in the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling constant $d$.
  We show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ introduces a natural equivalence relation among partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, a conformally covariant representative can always be chosen.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n,m)$, where $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case where $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we demonstrate that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n,n)$ setting.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative effects in JT gravity from KdV equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the partition function of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity is obtained by an integral transformation of volumes of moduli spaces for Riemann surfaces, also known as the Weil-Petersson volumes. This fact enables us to compute the perturbative genus expansion of the partition function by solving a KdV-type non-linear partial differential equation. In this work, we find that this KdV equation also admits transseries solutions. We give a systematic algorithm to explicitly construct a one-parameter transseries solution to the KdV equation. Our approach is based on general two-dimensional topological gravity, and the results for the JT gravity are easily obtained as a special case. The results in the leading non-perturbative sector perfectly agree with another independent calculation from topological recursions in random matrices.</description>

      <title>Macdonald deformation of Vogel's universality and link hyperpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vogel's universality implies a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. Actually this is true (if at all) only for a piece of representation theory captured by knot/Chern-Simons theory, where some irreducible representations are often undistinguishable and combined into new ``universally-irreducible" entities (uirreps). We consider from this point of view the recently discovered Macdonald deformation of quantum dimensions, for which a kind of universality holds for the ADE series. The claim is that universal are not Macdonald dimensions themselves, but their products with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which themselves are functions of $q$ and $t$ in Macdonald theory. These products are precisely what arises in knot/refined Chern-Simons theory. Actually, we consider the simplest decomposition of adjoint square into six uirreps and obtain the universal formulas for hyperpolynomials of the Hopf link and, more generally, of the torus links $T[2,2n]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

      <title>To reset or not to reset in a finite domain: that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to non-vanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for a monoparametric family of distributions, to shed light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for the optimal search strategy, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.</description>

      <title>Sampling and equidistribution theorems for elliptic second order operators, lifting of eigenvalues, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider elliptic second order partial differential operators with Lipschitz continuous leading order coefficients on finite cubes and the whole Euclidean space. We prove quantitative sampling and equidistribution theorems for eigenfunctions. The estimates are scale-free, in the sense that for a sequence of growing cubes we obtain uniform estimates. These results are applied to prove lifting of eigenvalues as well as the infimum of the essential spectrum, and an uncertainty relation (aka spectral inequality) for short energy interval spectral projectors. Several application including random operators are discussed. In the proof we have to overcome several challenges posed by the variable coefficients of the leading term.</description>

      <title>AdS/CFT Duality and Anyons in $SU(N)_k$ Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the holographic realization of anyons in \(SU(N)_k\) Chern-Simons theory within the AdS/CFT framework. The study extends traditional models, such as \(SU(2)\), to higher-rank groups like \(SU(3)\) and \(SU(4)\), focusing on the fusion, braiding, and quantum dimensions of anyons. A correspondence between Wilson loops in the bulk and boundary defect operators is established, demonstrating how the modular data of Chern-Simons theory relates to the boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The topological defects, fusion algebras, and operator spectra are analyzed from both the bulk and boundary perspectives, highlighting the relationship between bulk topological defects and boundary operators. Additionally, a conjecture is made that the boundary operator algebra forms a modular tensor category, providing a framework for exploring holographic dualities in topologically non-trivial systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipatively dressed quasiparticles in boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains experiencing strong boundary dissipation is accounted by introducing quasiparticles with a renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. This allows us to evaluate the spectrum of the NESS in terms of the Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system which has the same set of eigenstates, the so-called dissipation-projected Hamiltonian. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of the XXX and XXZ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as the XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, substantially altering the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear wave equation on a class of spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in the decelerated regime with spatial topology $\mathbb{R}^3$. Employing twisted $t$-weighted multiplier vector fields, we establish uniform energy bounds and derive integrated local energy decay estimates across the entire range of the decelerated expansion regime. Furthermore, we obtain a hierarchy of $r^p$-weighted energy estimates \`a la the Dafermos-Rodnianski $r^p$-method, which leads to energy decay estimates. As a consequence, we demonstrate pointwise decay estimates for solutions and their derivatives. In the wave zone, this pointwise decay is optimal in the "radiation" and "sub-radiation" cases, and almost optimal around the radiation case.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of integer-valued random interface models on the two-dimensional square lattice that include the solid-on-solid model and more generally $p$-SOS models for $0&lt;p\le2$, and prove that at sufficiently high temperature the interface is delocalized logarithmically uniformly in the boundary data. Fr\"ohlich and Spencer had studied the analogous problem with free boundary data, and our proof is based on their multi-scale argument, with various technical improvements.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between braid group representations, defect operators, and holography within the AdS/CFT framework. It focuses on the correspondence between bulk Wilson loops and boundary defect operators, emphasizing how braid group representations map to these operators. The study also explores fusion and braiding operations in modular tensor categories, which are crucial for understanding anyons in topological quantum field theories. By providing a unified framework, this work bridges the gap between bulk and boundary physics and offers insights into the holographic realization of topological defects. The results suggest new avenues for research in holographic anyons and their applications in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider a suitable generalization of the Feynman path integral on a specific class of Riemannian manifolds consisting of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant Riemannian metrics. The main tools we use are the Cartan development map, the notion of oscillatory integral, and the Chernoff approximation theorem. We prove that, for a class of functions of a dense subspace of the relevant Hilbert space, the Feynman map produces the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, where the Laplace-Beltrami operator coincides with the second order Casimir operator of the group.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Anomaly Indicators of (2+1)-D Fermionic Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical proposal for the anomaly indicators of symmetries of (2+1)-d fermionic topological orders, and work out the consequences of our proposal in several nontrivial examples. Our proposal is an invariant of a super modular tensor category with a fermionic group action, which gives a (3+1)-d topological field theory (TFT) that we conjecture to be invertible; the anomaly indicators are partition functions of this TFT on $4$-manifolds generating the corresponding twisted spin bordism group. Our construction relies on a bosonization construction due to Gaiotto-Kapustin and Tata-Kobayashi-Bulmash-Barkeshli, together with a ``bosonization conjecture'' which we explain in detail. In the second half of the paper, we discuss several examples of our invariants relevant to condensed-matter physics. The most important example we consider is $\mathbb{Z}/4^T\times \mathbb{Z}/2^f$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^FC$, which many fermionic topological orders enjoy, including the $\mathrm{U}(1)_5$ spin Chern-Simons theory. Using newly developed tools involving the Smith long exact sequence, we calculate the cobordism group that classifies its anomaly, present the generating manifold, and calculate the partition function on the generating manifold which serves as our anomaly indicator. Our approach allows us to reproduce anomaly indicators known in the literature with simpler proofs, including $\mathbb{Z}/4^{Tf}$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^F$, and other symmetry groups in the 10-fold way involving Lie group symmetries.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a three-dimensional Bose gas of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range (also known as contact) interactions. Such interactions are encoded by (singular) boundary conditions imposed on the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide.
  It is well known that imposing the same kind of boundary conditions as in the two-body problem with a point interaction leads to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below (and thus unstable). This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes overly strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide.
  In order to avoid such instability, we develop a suggestion originally formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962, introducing slightly modified boundary conditions that weaken the strength of the interaction between two particles $i$ and $j$ in two scenarios: (a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; (b) another distinct pair of particles approach each other. In all other cases, the usual boundary condition is restored.
  Using a quadratic form approach, we construct a class of Hamiltonians characterized by such modified boundary conditions, that are self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also compare our approach with the one developed years ago by Albeverio, H{\o}egh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977). In particular, we show that the $N$-body Hamiltonian defined by Albeverio et al. is a special case of our class of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we also introduce a Dirichlet form by considering a more general weight function, and we prove that the corresponding $N$-body Hamiltonians essentially coincide with those constructed via our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09023v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel result in $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven, and applied to the topological classification of classically frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This result generalizes a lemma that had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. The methods used in the classification of topological insulators and superconductors are here generalized and their generalizations applied to systems that are not quantum mechanical. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{BDI}$, and $\mathrm{CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of classically frustrated spin models and is compared to that of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

Abstract: We propose a metriplectic reformulation of Lagrangian variational formulations for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We prove that solutions to these constrained variational principles can be generated by the sum of a classic Poisson bracket and a metriplectic 4-bracket, that takes the Hamiltonian and the entropy as generators. We study different cases: simple systems, discrete systems, Euler-Poincar\'e reduced systems and systems with no symplectic part. Several example are shown, including infinite dimensional problems arising from continuum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Interacting Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Systematic Modeling of Structural Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has drawn significant interest due to recent experiments which show that TBG can exhibit strongly correlated behavior such as the superconducting and correlated insulator phases. Much of the theoretical work on TBG has been based on analysis of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model which includes a phenomenological parameter to account for lattice relaxation. In this work, we use a newly developed continuum model which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. In particular, we model structural relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. We compare the impact of the two relaxation models on the corresponding many-body model by defining an interacting model projected to the flat bands. We perform tests at charge neutrality at both the Hartree-Fock and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) level of theory and find the systematic relaxation model gives quantitative differences from the simplified relaxation model.</description>

      <title>Power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of quantum states through linear maps beyond quantum operations has many important applications in various areas of quantum information processing. Current methods simulate unphysical maps by sampling physical operations according to classically determined probability distributions. In this work, we show that using quantum measurement instead leads to lower simulation costs for general Hermitian-preserving maps. Remarkably, we establish the equality between the simulation cost and the well-known diamond norm, thus closing a previously known gap and assigning diamond norm a universal operational meaning for all Hermitian-preserving maps. We demonstrate our method in two applications closely related to error mitigation and quantum machine learning, where it exhibits a favorable scaling. These findings highlight the power of quantum measurement in simulating unphysical operations, in which quantum interference is believed to play a vital role. Our work paves the way for more efficient sampling techniques and has the potential to be extended to more quantum information processing scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Glauber-Kawasaki dynamics on a $d$-dimensional periodic lattice of size $N$, that is, a stochastic time evolution of particles performing random walks with interaction subject to the exclusion rule (Kawasaki part), in general, of non-gradient type, together with the effect of the creation and annihilation of particles (Glauber part) whose rates are set to favor two levels of particle density, called sparse and dense. We then study the limit of our dynamics under the hydrodynamic space-time scaling, that is, $1/N$ in space and a diffusive scaling $N^2$ for the Kawasaki part and another scaling $K=K(N)$, which diverges slower, for the Glauber part in time. In the limit as $N\to\infty$, we show that the particles autonomously make phase separation into sparse or dense phases at the microscopic level, and an interface separating two regions is formed at the macroscopic level and evolves under an anisotropic curvature flow.
  In the present article, we show that the particle density at the macroscopic level is well approximated by a solution of a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlinear diffusion term of divergence form and a large reaction term. Furthermore, by applying the results of Funaki, Gu and Wang [arXiv:2404.12234] for the convergence rate of the diffusion matrix approximated by local functions, we obtain a quantitative hydrodynamic limit as well as the upper bound for the allowed diverging speed of $K=K(N)$.
  The above result for the derivation of the interface motion is proved by combining our result with that in a companion paper by Funaki and Park [arXiv:2403.01732], in which we analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the solution of the reaction-diffusion equation obtained in the present article and derived an anisotropic curvature flow in the situation where the macroscopic reaction term determined from the Glauber part is bistable and balanced.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation of Quantum Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The high resolution sampling methods for acoustic sources from multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse observation directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to novel uniqueness results and high resolution sampling methods for source support from multi-frequency sparse far field patterns. With a single pair of observation directions $\pm\hat{x}$, we prove that the lines $\{z\in\mathbb R^2|\, \hat{x}\cdot z = \hat{x}\cdot y, \,y\in A_{\hat{x}}\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the directions $\pm\hat{x}$, where $A_{\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the corners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is parallel to $\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of polygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest number of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the corners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce two novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two dimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two indicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high resolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine the unknown source function.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound of the dynamical critical exponent of the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic Ising model under Glauber dynamics and establish an upper bound on the spectral gap for finite systems. This bound implies the critical exponent inequality $z \geq 2$, thereby rigorously improving the previously known estimate $z \geq 2 - \eta$. Our proof relies on the mapping from stochastic processes to frustration-free quantum systems and leverages the Simon--Lieb and Gosset--Huang inequalities.</description>

      <title>A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

      <title>Ind-cluster algebras and infinite Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prototypical examples of a cluster algebra is the coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian: using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent Pl\"ucker coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmannians and its link with the infinite Grassmannian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson in connection with the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) hierarchy, an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations which possess soliton solutions. In this article we prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the colimit construction. More generally, we prove that cluster algebras of infinite rank are precisely the ind-objects of a natural category of cluster algebras.</description>
