      <title>Toward Completing the Picture of Control in Schulze and Ranked Pairs Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both Schulze and ranked pairs are voting rules that satisfy many natural, desirable axioms. Many standard types of electoral control (with a chair seeking to change the outcome of an election by interfering with the election structure) have already been studied. However, for control by replacing candidates or voters and for (exact) multimode control that combines multiple standard attacks, many questions remain open. We solve a number of these open cases for Schulze and ranked pairs. In addition, we fix a flaw in the reduction of Menton and Singh [IJCAI 2013] showing that Schulze is resistant to constructive control by deleting candidates and re-establish a vulnerability result for destructive control by deleting candidates. In some of our proofs, we study variants of s-t vertex cuts in graphs that are related to our control problems.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-price with novel cuts, and a new Stackelberg Security Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticipating the strategies of potential attackers is crucial for protecting critical infrastructure. We can represent the challenge of the defenders of such infrastructure as a Stackelberg security game. The defender must decide how to allocate limited resources to protect specific targets, aiming to maximize their expected utility (such as minimizing the extent of damage) and considering that attackers will respond in a way that is most advantageous to them.
  We present novel valid inequalities to find a Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium in both Stackelberg games and Stackelberg security games. We also consider a Stackelberg security game that aims to protect targets with a defined budget. We use branch-and-price in this game to show that our approach outperforms the standard formulation in the literature, and we conduct an extensive computational study to analyze the impact of various branch-and-price parameters on the performance of our method in different game settings.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Memory Strategies in Partial-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of solving stochastic games with mean-payoff objectives. Instead of identifying special classes in which simple strategies are sufficient to play $\epsilon$-optimally, or form $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, we consider general partial-information multiplayer games and ask what can be achieved with (and against) finite-memory strategies up to a {given} bound on the memory. We show $NP$-hardness for approximating zero-sum values, already with respect to memoryless strategies and for 1-player reachability games. On the other hand, we provide upper bounds for solving games of any fixed number of players $k$. We show that one can decide in polynomial space if, for a given $k$-player game, $\epsilon\ge 0$ and bound $b$, there exists an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium in which all strategies use at most $b$ memory modes. For given $\epsilon&gt;0$, finding an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium with respect to $b$-bounded strategies can be done in $FN[NP]$. Similarly for 2-player zero-sum games, finding a $b$-bounded strategy that, against all $b$-bounded opponent strategies, guarantees an outcome within $\epsilon$ of a given value, can be done in $FNP[NP]$. Our constructions apply to parity objectives with minimal simplifications. Our results improve the status quo in several well-known special cases of games. In particular, for $2$-player zero-sum concurrent mean-payoff games, one can approximate ordinary zero-sum values (without restricting admissible strategies) in $FNP[NP]$.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms that play a game, not toss a coin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized mechanisms can have good normative properties compared to their deterministic counterparts. However, randomized mechanisms are problematic in several ways such as in their verifiability. We propose here to derandomize such mechanisms by having agents play a game instead of tossing a coin. The game is designed so an agent's best action is to play randomly, and this play then injects ``randomness'' into the mechanism. This derandomization retains many of the good normative properties of the original randomized mechanism but gives a mechanism that is deterministic and easy, for instance, to audit. We consider three related methods to derandomize randomized mechanism in six different domains: voting, facility location, task allocation, school choice, peer selection, and resource allocation. We propose a number of novel derandomized mechanisms for these six domains with good normative properties. Each mechanism has a mixed Nash equilibrium in which agents play a modular arithmetic game with an uniform mixed strategy. In all but one mixed Nash equilibrium, agents report their preferences over the original problem sincerely. The derandomized methods are thus ``quasi-strategy proof''. In one domain, we additionally show that a new and desirable normative property emerges as a result of derandomization.</description>

      <title>A characterization of absorbing sets in coalition formation games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.11689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a standard myopic dynamic process among coalition structures, an absorbing set is a minimal collection of such structures that is never left once entered through that process. Absorbing sets are an important solution concept in coalition formation games, but they have drawbacks: they can be large and hard to obtain. In this paper, we characterize an absorbing set in terms of a collection consisting of a small number of sets of coalitions that we refer to as a "reduced form" of a game. We apply our characterization to study convergence to stability in several economic environments.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>
