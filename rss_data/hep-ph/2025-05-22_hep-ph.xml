      <title>String Theory and Grand Unification Suggest a Sub-Microelectronvolt QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions, grand unification, and string theory are each compelling extensions of the Standard Model. We show that combining these frameworks imposes strong constraints on the QCD axion mass. Using unitarity arguments and explicit string compactifications - such as those from the Kreuzer-Skarke (KS) type IIB ensemble - we find that the axion mass is favored to lie within the range $10^{-11}$ eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim$ $10^{-8}$ eV. This range is directly relevant for near-future axion dark matter searches, including ABRACADABRA/DMRadio and CASPEr. We argue that grand unification and the absence of proton decay suggest a compactification volume that keeps the string scale above the unification scale ($\sim$$10^{16}$ GeV), which in turn limits how heavy the axion can be. The same requirements limit the KS axiverse to have at most $\sim$47 axions. As an additional application of our methodology, we search for axions in the KS axiverse that could explain the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) hints of evolving dark energy but find none with high enough decay constant ($f_a \gtrsim 2.5 \times 10^{17}$ GeV); we comment on why such high decay constants and low axion masses are difficult to obtain in string compactifications more broadly.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen 21 cm Constraints on the Photon's Spin Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the fundamental but untested possibility that the photon is a continuous spin particle (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. When $\rho\neq 0$, the familiar polarization modes of the photon transform non-trivially under Lorentz boosts, leading to deviations from familiar QED. Surprisingly, these deviations are strongest at low energy, but smoothly vanish in the $\rho\rightarrow 0$ limit. In this letter, we compute corrections to the hydrogen 21cm transition rate, which is expected to be particularly sensitive given the small hyperfine energy splitting $\omega$. We find deviations from QED $\propto \rho^2 \alpha^2/\omega^2$ at leading order, suggesting experimental constraints $\rho\lesssim 1$ meV. Building on this work, we expect that a range of other atomic, molecular, or condensed matter systems could be used to provide even more stringent tests of $\rho$ in electromagnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is Sensitive to Dark Photons and the Axion-Photon Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that nuclear magnetic resonance based searches for dark matter (DM) have intrinsic and powerful sensitivity to dark photons and the axion-photon coupling. The reason is conceptually straightforward. An instrument such as CASPEr-Gradient begins with a large sample of nuclear spins polarised in a background magnetic field. In the presence of axion DM coupled to nucleons, the spin ensemble feels an effective magnetic field $\mathbf{B} \propto \nabla a$ that tilts the spins, generating a potentially observable precession. If the magnetic field is real rather than effective, the system responds identically. A real field can be generated by a kinetically mixed dark photon within the shielded region the sample is placed or an axion coupled to photons through its interaction with the background magnetic field. We show that all three signals are detectable and distinguishable. If CASPEr-Gradient were to reach the QCD axion prediction of the axion-nucleon coupling, it would simultaneously be sensitive to kinetic mixings of $\epsilon \simeq 3 \times 10^{-16}$ and axion-photon couplings of $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \simeq 2 \times 10^{-16}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m \simeq 1\,\mu{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>The Bearable Inhomogeneity of the Baryon Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of precision measurements of light element abundances in concordance with the Cosmic Microwave Background for scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model that generate large inhomogeneities in the baryon-to-photon ratio. We show that precision Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) imposes strong constraints on any mechanism that produces large scale inhomogeneities at temperatures of the order or below a TeV. In particular, we find that inhomogeneities of the order of $20\%$ at comoving length scales larger than the comoving horizon at the temperature of $3~\mathrm{TeV}$ are in conflict with the measured light element abundances. This sensitivity to physics at such early times is because inhomogeneities in baryon number homogenize predominantly through diffusion, which is a slow process. BBN therefore acts as a novel probe of baryogenesis below the $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale, and readily rules out some of the proposed scenarios of baryogenesis in the literature. We discuss the implications for electroweak baryogenesis. In addition we show that precision BBN is a new probe of first-order phase transitions which produce a gravitational wave signal in the frequency range from pHz to mHz. This leads to constraints on the electroweak phase transition, as well as the first-order phase transitions that have been postulated to explain the pulsar timing array signal. We also discuss the future prospects of improvements in this probe.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Charm Tetraquarks in a Mixture Model: Coupled-Channel Analysis with $c\bar{c}$ and Hadronic Molecular Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the $X(3872)$ and other exotic hadrons has been a subject of extensive investigation since the first observation of the $X(3872)$ in 2003. While various theoretical models have been proposed, including hadronic molecular and compact tetraquark interpretations, some experimental evidence suggests that the $X(3872)$ may be a mixture state of a hadronic molecule and a $c\bar{c}$ core. In this work, we perform a systematic study of the hidden-charm tetraquark candidates $X(3860)$, $X(3872)$, and $Z(3930)$ using a coupled-channel model that incorporates both $c\bar{c}$ states and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ hadronic molecular components. The $c\bar{c}$ sector is described based on the constituent quark model predictions for the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ ($J = 0, 1, 2$) states, while the meson-meson interactions are modeled using pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange potentials. The model parameters are fixed to reproduce the masses of the $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$, and the resulting framework is used to predict the mass and structure of the $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ state associated with the $X(3860)$. Our results support the mixture interpretation of these exotic hadrons, exhibiting strong attractions from the transition potential between $c\bar{c}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ components. The molecular component is found to dominate in the $X(3872)$, while the $c\bar{c}$ component plays a more prominent role in the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$.</description>

      <title>Dark Z-mediated dark matter with verifiable exotic scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a dark matter scenario where a dark Z boson possessing mass mixing with the SM Z boson couples to the DM candidate and serves as the portal to the SM. The UV origin of the mass mixing in the form of an extra dark Higgs doublet and a scalar dark singlet provides new exotic scalars which can constitute the final state of DM annihilation during freeze-out. We find that existing constraints on the observed Higgs coupling strength, exotic Higgs searches and dark matter observables complement each other, while future searches for exotic Higgs decays and resonant heavy scalars at HL-LHC will be sensitive to part of the allowed parameter space.</description>

      <title>Jet Substructure Probe on Scalar Leptoquark Models via Top Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of leptoquarks and their couplings to fermions with different chiralities provides a powerful tool for distinguishing among different leptoquark models. As a case study, we focus on two specific third-generation scalar leptoquark models, $S_3$ and $R_2$, which differ in their electroweak quantum numbers and chiral structures of couplings to the top quark, leading to distinct top-quark polarization states. To enhance the efficacy of the analysis, we employ jet substructure techniques like Soft Drop, $N$-subjettiness, and our custom $b$-tagging method, along with other event variables. The analysis has been performed using both fixed radius and dynamic radius jet clustering algorithms. A multivariate analysis using a boosted decision tree (BDT) is performed to isolate signal from the Standard Model background. For a leptoquark mass of 1250 GeV, the analysis achieves a signal significance of up to $5.3\,\sigma$ at the 14 TeV HL-LHC. Furthermore, a $CL_s$-based profile likelihood estimator is applied to polarization-sensitive variables to discriminate between the two models. To enhance separation between the two models, an additional BDT classifier score is obtained by training a BDT network to distinguish between the $S_3$ and $R_2$ models. In the chosen signal region, the BDT classifier score provides a separation score of up to $3.2\,\sigma$, outperforming traditional variables such as $E_b/E_t$ and $\cos\theta_b$.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily polarized $\gamma$-photon source from nonlinear Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Compton photon source for upcoming laser-particle experiments in the collision scenario of high-energy electron beams and relativistic laser pulses. The stronger laser field could not only improve the scattering probability but also induce broader photon beam divergence. To maximize the photon flux in a realistic narrow angular acceptance, we show that a balance must be met for the laser intensity to boost the scattering probability and simultaneously confine its beam divergence. For the currently experiment-concerned $10~\textrm{GeV}$ energy regime, the balanced laser intensity locates in the intermediate intensity regime of $\xi \sim O(1)$. In these regimes of laser intensity and electron energy, the accepted photons within a relatively narrow acceptance are highly polarized in the state closely relating to the polarization of the laser pulse, which actually implies a potential route to finely control the photon polarization via the laser polarization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inert Triplet desert region with a pNGB Dark Matter and its Gravitational Wave signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scalar sector of the conventional hyperchargeless inert triplet model (ITM) to include a second dark matter (DM) candidate, which appears to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). The usual ITM with an extended scalar sector offers a DM candidate along with novel signatures at different experiments, e.g., colliders, gravitational wave detectors, etc. Nevertheless, hitherto unseen experimental detections have placed stringent constraints on the ITM parameter space. Moreover, triplet masses lighter than $1.9$ TeV, consistent with the existing or upcoming collider sensitivity reach, are already excluded from the DM observable, as they yield an underabundant relic density due to a strong $SU(2)_L$ gauge annihilation. Inclusion of a pNGB DM, via a complex $SU(2)_L$ scalar singlet and through the soft-breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry, helps to revive the sub-TeV regime of the triplet DM. This resurgence relies on a proficient conversion between the two DM species. Using this inter-conversion, with the triplet DM as the lighter one between the two, we show that it is possible to push the triplet DM contribution to $50\% - 60\%$ of the total relic density. This offers a significant improvement over the traditional ITM with a single DM candidate, where the same can at most reach $10\% - 20\%$. Besides, the concerned bipartite DM framework also offers the possibility of a first-order phase transition along various constituent field directions. Among these, the one along the real $SU(2)_L$ singlet direction can be a strong one which subsequently yields detectable gravitational wave signals at the upcoming space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, BBO, DECIGO, etc., alongside distinctive and complementary signatures at the various DM and collider quests.</description>

      <title>SU(3) flavor symmetry analysis of hyperon non-leptonic two body decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper present a systematic study of hyperon non-leptonic two-body decays induced by light quark transitions, particularly the $s \rightarrow u\bar{u}d$ process, within the framework of SU(3) flavor symmetry. The effective weak Hamiltonian is decomposed into irreducible SU(3) representations, including the 27-plet and octet components, and applied to analyze decays of octet and decuplet baryons and charmed baryons. Both the irreducible representation amplitude (IRA) approach and the topological diagrammatic analysis (TDA) are employed to construct decay amplitudes and constrain the parameter space. SU(3) symmetry-breaking effects arising from the strange quark mass are incorporated systematically. A global fit to current experimental data allows us to extract form factors and predict branching ratios and asymmetry parameters for several decay channels, including $\Lambda^0 \rightarrow p\pi^-$, $\Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\pi^0$, and $\Omega^- \rightarrow \Xi^0\pi^-$. Our results demonstrate the predictive power of SU(3) flavor symmetry while highlighting significant symmetry-breaking effects, especially in amplitudes related to the 27-plet. Notably, the $\Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\pi^0$ decay channel exhibits a deviation exceeding $1\sigma$ from experimental measurements, suggesting the possible presence of new decay mechanisms or contributions beyond the Standard Model. This work provides a systematic framework for future tests of the Standard Model and the search for new physics in hyperon decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of quarkonium created in heavy-ion collisions is intrinsically connected to the correlation functions of adjoint chromoelectric fields in quantum chromodynamics. We study such correlation functions in a weak-coupling expansion in a thermal medium. We identify three distinct gauge-invariant correlators, and evaluate them to next-to-leading order. Two of the resulting correlators turn out to be asymmetric. We pinpoint the source of this asymmetry to Matsubara zero modes associated with Wilson lines. The results are shown to agree well with recent lattice calculations at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Constraining anti-baryonic dark matter through correlated nucleon decay signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon number violation in the visible sector induced by anti-baryonic dark matter provides a viable mechanism for low-scale baryogenesis. Two of the most sensitive probes of this scenario are neutron decay processes such as $n \to \text{invisible}$ and $n \to \pi^0 + \text{invisible}$. In this work, we discuss the generation of di-nucleon decay processes such as $nn \to \bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}$ and $nn \to \pi^0\pi^0$ at one-loop, arising from the operators responsible for induced nucleon decays. While nucleon decay rates in this model depend on the local dark matter density, di-nucleon decay processes do not, providing a complementary probe of the new physics. We thus use bounds on both nucleon and di-nucleon decays to constrain the mass and terrestrial density of anti-baryonic dark matter.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence via Modified Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</description>

Abstract: We construct a formalism which describes the resonances decaying into four pseudoscalar meson final states. This method is fully covariant and can be directly applied for the partial-wave analysis of high statistical data. Two topologies of the process are considered: two intermediate resonances each decaying into two final mesons and cascade decay via three meson intermediate states. In particular, we consider the production of such states in the central collision reactions and in radiative $J/\Psi$ decay.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlator at Hadron Colliders: Celestial Blocks and Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlator (EEC) is an event shape observable that characterizes the distribution of energy flux in collision events. We initiate the study of full-range EEC at hadron colliders, generalizing the extensively studied EEC in $e^+e^-$ collision as well as the transverse EEC in hadron collisions. We derive celestial blocks from Lorentz symmetry to perform partial wave decomposition of the EEC at hadron colliders. These celestial blocks are essentially conformal blocks on the 2d celestial sphere, which have additional dependence on the collinear spin of ``light-ray transition matrix'' along the collision axis. In this work, we perform the first leading-order (LO) analytic calculation of this observable in pure Yang-Mills theory and use it as an example to illustrate the block decomposition. Numerically, the block expansion demonstrates superior accuracy in the collinear limit compared to conventional power series expansion. Analytically, we observe in this example that the block coefficients exhibit analyticity in both collinear and transverse spin. In addition, we analyze several kinematic limits at LO -- collinear, back-to-back, opposite coplanar and Regge limit. While the first three limits naturally generalize their $e^+e^-$ collision counterparts or transverse EEC and are governed by soft-collinear dynamics, the Regge limit requires complete angular dependence and reveals BFKL physics. Phenomenologically, we propose a realistic experimental setup and briefly discuss how the convolution of parton distribution function modifies the perturbative EEC result. Our work suggests that the full-range EEC at hadron colliders is an elegant observable which probes a broader kinematic space and connects various regimes of different QCD dynamics through a single measurement.</description>

      <title>Resolving the $\Delta(1232)$ partial width anomaly: Complex pole residue is not a fundamental resonance property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resonant properties of excited hadrons are commonly identified with the complex pole positions and residues of the scattering amplitude. The mass and total decay width are given by position, whereas the partial width is given by the magnitude of the residue. If this identification was correct, the partial width of famous $\Delta(1232)$ would be larger than its total width. By using a simple model that predicts residue phases of prominent baryons $N^*$, $\Delta$, $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$, and low mass mesons, we resolve this anomaly and show that the residue cannot be a fundamental resonant property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive, for the first time, analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to thermal equilibrium, which leads to a "quantum" equilibrium with nonzero coherence. These results can be implemented in a subgrid model of collisional flavor transformation, an important step toward the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</description>

      <title>Broadband Search for Axion Dark Matter via Shift Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to detect axion dark matter based on a topological phenomenon known as the shift current. We exploit the second-order nonlinearity of the shift current by applying a strong oscillating electric field. This field enhances the axion-induced shift current signal and downconverts its frequency to a more accessible range. The non-dissipative nature of the shift current allows us to achieve broadband detection via difference frequency generation. We demonstrate, using Type-I Weyl semimetal TaAs property, the possibility of probing the parameter space of the QCD axion in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ - $\mathcal{O}(100) \ \rm meV$ corresponding to the photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq$ $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})$ - $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})~\text{GeV}^{-1}$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new class of charge-conjugation-odd flow observables and use them to investigate the dynamics of conserved currents in simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Inspired by the success of the initial energy and momentum distributions at predicting final-state anisotropic flow, we construct systematically-improvable initial-state estimators for final net-charge flow observables, which we validate with numerical simulations. This opens the possibility of a multitude of new charge-dependent probes of heavy-ion collisions of different systems and energies.</description>

      <title>A Match Made in Heaven: Linking Observables in Inflationary Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlation functions of inflaton and graviton perturbations are the fundamental observables of early universe cosmology and remain a primary target for observations. In this work, we ask the following question: are these observables independent of one another? We find that in the parity-odd sector of inflationary perturbation theory, the answer is a resounding no! In earlier work we derived a correlator-to-correlator factorisation formula which states that parity-odd correlators factorise into lower-point correlators under some mild assumptions on the underlying theory. In this work, we show that these assumptions are satisfied in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity where the action of minimal inflation is augmented by a coupling between the inflaton and the gravitational Chern-Simons term. Such a theory gives rise to a parity-odd trispectrum of curvature perturbations, and we show that such a trispectrum can be expressed solely in terms of the bispectrum that arises due to the minimal coupling between the inflaton and graviton, and the graviton power spectrum which receives a parity-odd correction in this theory. The trispectrum is quadratic in this mixed inflaton-graviton bispectrum and can therefore be interpreted as a ``double copy". Our final expression for the parity-odd trispectrum is a relatively simple function of the external momenta that is rational and factorised.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a lattice calculation of the correlators of two chromoelectric fields in the adjoint representation connected by adjoint Wilson lines at non-zero temperature. These correlators arise in the study of quarkonium dynamics and of adjoint heavy quark diffusion in deconfined matter. We work in SU(3) gauge theory using either gradient flow or multi-level algorithms for noise reduction, and discuss the renormalization of the correlators on the lattice. We find that a Casimir factor rescaling relates the adjoint correlators corresponding to the diffusion of an adjoint heavy quark and the octet-octet quarkonium transitions to the chromoelectric correlator in the fundamental representation describing the diffusion of a heavy quark.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating scalar trispectrum from helical primordial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) as a potential source of the parity-violating signatures recently implied by observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the large-scale structure of the Universe. Among various possibilities, helical PMFs are of particular interest, as they inherently violate parity symmetry and can explain the observed magnetic fields, especially in void regions. PMFs, if generated in the early universe, can source curvature perturbations, which evolve into the present density fluctuations observed in galaxy surveys. Motivated by this, we focus on the imprint of helical PMFs on the trispectrum of the sourced primordial curvature perturbations, a leading-order statistics sensitive to parity-violating signals in three-dimensional space. We derive the analytic expressions for the trispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations sourced by taking into account both the helical and non-helical PMFs and analytically reduce their expressions by using the pole approximation, whose validity is confirmed by comparison with the exact results. We find that, varying the ratio of the amplitude of the helical to non-helical power spectrum, the structure of the trispectrum qualitatively changes, particularly the ratio of the imaginary to real components of the trispectrum. Our findings highlight the primordial trispectrum as a promising probe of cosmological parity violation in the early universe and provide a theoretical basis for future precise observations of higher order statistics in the CMB anisotropies and the galaxy clustering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of baryon number violation during an electroweak phase transition (EWPT) within the framework of a scalar electroweak multiplet extension of the Standard Model. We classify the multiplet representations, topological properties, and corresponding thermal histories. Sphaleron or monopole topological field solutions emerge during the EWPT depending on the stage of the phase transition and the hypercharge of the new scalar multiplet. Furthermore, the monopole field solution pertains when the neutral component of the additional scalar multiplet is a viable dark matter candidate. We further analyze other formal considerations, including the construction of the \lq\lq sphaleron matrix\rq\rq\, for higher dimensional representations, computation of the sphaleron and monopole masses, and the choice of boundary conditions when solving the field equations of motion. We apply these considerations to the computation of sphaleron energy and monopole mass within the context of a multi-step EWPT, employing the SU(2)$_L$ septuplet scalar extension to the Standard Model (SM) as a case of study from the minimal dark matter paradigm. For the first step of a two-step EWPT, we delineate the relationship between the monopole mass and the parameters relevant to dark matter phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A lot of exotic hadrons were reported in the past twenty years, which bring us the renaissance of the hadron spectroscopy. Most of them can be understood as hadronic molecules, whose interactions are mainly due to the exchange of light mesons, and specifically, light vector mesons through the coupled-channel unitary approach within the local hidden-gauge formalism. It is still controversial whether the interaction arising from the exchange of heavy mesons is capable of forming hadronic molecules. We apply the coupled-channel unitary approach to study the fully-heavy $b \bar b c \bar c$ system, where the exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$, $B_c^*$, and $\Upsilon$. Especially, the $J/\psi$ meson is much lighter than the $B_c^{(*)}$ mesons, so the present study can be taken as a general investigation on the question whether a lower-mass fully-heavy meson is able to bind two higher-mass fully-heavy hadrons. Our results suggest the existence of the fully-heavy hadronic molecules $|B_c^{+} B_c^{-}; J^{PC}=0^{++} \rangle$, $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} - c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{+-} \rangle$, and $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{*-}; J^{PC}=2^{++} \rangle$ as well as the possible existence of $|B_c^{*+} B_c^{-} + c.c.; J^{PC}=1^{++} \rangle$. These states are potentially to be observed in the $\mu^+ \mu^- J/\psi$ and $\mu^+ \mu^- \Upsilon$ channels in future ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Resolving the W-Boson Mass in the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the parameter space of the Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model (LS-2HDM) is investigated to align the W-boson mass reported by the CDF and CMS experiment with recent theoretical and experimental findings. The Lepton Specific Two Higgs Doublet Model, a distinguished category within Two Higgs Doublet Models, contains two CP-even, one CP-odd, and two charged scalar bosons, which play crucial role in estimating W boson mass. First, constraints from diverse experimental data, including ATLAS 13 TeV analyses, rare B-meson decays, and Lepton Flavor Universality in tau-lepton and Z-boson decays, are determined and imposed on the parameter space of the model. These constraints are subsequently applied to potential solutions generated through random scans using SARAH 4.13.0 and analyzed using SPheno 4.0.3. The analysis indicates the possibility of realizing the CDF and CMS reported W-boson mass up to $1\sigma$ . The mass of the $W$ boson was determined by the CMS collaboration as $80.3602 \pm 0.0099$ GeV in 2024 and was in very good agreement with the Standard Model. In the current analysis, the $W$ mass value reported by the CDF collaboration in 2022 ($80.4335 \pm 0.0094$ GeV) has been compared with the latest CMS measurement in the context of the LS-2HDM model. Analyses done with the parametric freedom of LS-2HDM show that the model can equally well explain both the measured value of CDF and the measurement result of CMS. It is emphasized by our findings that LS-2HDM contains areas favorable to both CDF and CMS data, which makes both existing experimental results explainable under the framework of the same model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the ATOMKI anomaly with a very light $Z'$ state that features non-anomalous and non-flavour-universal vector and axial-vector couplings to all leptons. This $Z'$ comes from a theoretical framework with a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ symmetry in addition to the Standard Model gauge group and is compliant with current measurements of the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and the muon as well as beam dump experiments. The lepton flavour structure of this model allows for $Z'$ couplings to all light neutrinos, suggesting the possibility of $Z'$-mediated Non-Standard Interactions (NSIs) of neutrinos in matter, so that measurements of the strength parameters of the NSIs can constrain the value of the couplings. We use experimental constraints on NSIs of neutrinos using older TEXONO data and newer IceCube data. The IceCube data, in particular, strongly constrain the flavour universality of the leptonic vector current. The constraints enable us to define the region of parameter space of this theoretical scenario that can be pursued in further phenomenological analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positronium spectrum and lifetimes are known with high precision. The situation is different for positronium moving across a magnetic field. The total momentum does not commute with the Hamiltonian and is replaced by the conserved pseudomomentum. The internal dynamics is not separated from the motion of the system as a whole. The Coulomb potential well is distorted and a wide outer potential well is created. We analytically determine the energy spectrum for a broad range of magnetic field and pseudomomentum values. The ground state energy is compared with the result obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The gauge independence of the pseudomomentum expectation value is established. On the pseudomomentum-magnetic field plane we locate the region in which the ground state resides in the outer well. The results may play a role in the suppression of pulsars' radio emission (polar cap problem).</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass genesis in Scoto-Inverse Seesaw with Modular $A_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid scotogenic inverse seesaw framework in which the Majorana mass term is generated at the one-loop level through the inclusion of a singlet fermion. This singlet Majorana fermion also serves as a viable thermal relic dark matter candidate due to its limited interactions with other fields. To construct the model, we adopt an $A_4$ flavour symmetry in a modular framework, where the odd modular weight of the fields ensures their stability, and the specific modular weights of the couplings yield distinctive modular forms, leading to various phenomenological consequences. The explicit flavour structure of the mass matrices produces characteristic correlation patterns among the parameters. Furthermore, we examine several testable implications of the model, including neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$), charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV), and direct detection prospects for the dark matter candidate. These features make our model highly testable in upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model IV: Impact of positronium formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first assessment of how the previously unexplored effect of positronium formation can impact on the value of the effective number of neutrino species in the Standard Model, $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. Adopting a Yukawa form for the electrostatic potential, we discuss two possible scenarios that differ primarily in their assumptions about entropy evolution. The first, out-of-equilibrium scenario assumes that thermal corrections to the potential such as Debye screening prevent positronium from appearing until the temperature drops below a threshold. Once the threshold is reached, entropy generated in the QED sector from the equilibration process, if instantaneous, leads to a variation in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ of at most $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value for $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a larger change. The second, equilibrium scenario assumes the QED sector to stay in equilibrium at all times. In this case, we show that cancellations between the first, $s$-wave bound- and scattering-states contributions ensure that it is possible to evolve the system across the bound-state formation threshold without generating entropy in the QED sector. The corresponding change in $N_{\rm eff}^{\rm SM}$ then closely matches the $\mathcal{O}(e^2)$ perturbative result derived in previous works and the $\mathcal{O}(e^4)$ contribution is capped at $|\Delta N_{\rm eff}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. We also comment on the impact of deviations from a pure Yukawa potential due to the presence of a thermal width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction rates of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a QED plasma determine the dynamics of their decoupling in the early universe. We show how to define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, and scattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. In the limit of massless electrons, we show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and only have a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. For comparison, the influence of a finite electron mass is quantified at LO. Finally we provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$.</description>

      <title>General form of effective operators from hidden sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a model-independent analysis of the dimension-six terms that are generated in the low energy effective theory when a hidden sector that communicates with the Standard Model (SM) through a specific portal operator is integrated out. We work within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework and consider the Higgs, neutrino and hypercharge portals. We find that, for each portal, the forms of the leading dimension-six terms in the low-energy effective theory are fixed and independent of the dynamics in the hidden sector. For the Higgs portal, we find that two independent dimension-six terms are generated, one of which has a sign that, under certain conditions, is fixed by the requirement that the dynamics in the hidden sector be causal and unitary. In the case of the neutrino portal, for a single generation of SM fermions and assuming that the hidden sector does not violate lepton number, a unique dimension-six term is generated, which corresponds to a specific linear combination of operators in the Warsaw basis. For the hypercharge portal, a unique dimension-six term is generated, which again corresponds to a specific linear combination of operators in the Warsaw basis. For both the neutrino and hypercharge portals, under certain conditions, the signs of these terms are fixed by the requirement that the hidden sector be causal and unitary. We perform a global fit of these dimension-six terms to electroweak precision observables, Higgs measurements and diboson production data and determine the current bounds on their coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark stars (DSs) -- first stars powered by dark-matter (DM) heating rather than fusion -- could form in the early Universe. They can grow to $\gtrsim 10^5 M_{\odot}$ masses and collapse into seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We demonstrate that diffuse neutrino flux generated by DSs can be observable in existing experiments and have energies reaching hundreds of MeV, providing novel window for probing SMBH progenitors. We establish first constraints on DSs and DM annihilations powering them using data from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube neutrino experiments, and consistent with James Webb Space Telescope observations. Upcoming experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande, DUNE, JUNO will be able to explore DS properties with enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Global Neutrino Constraints on the Minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge model in light of the latest neutrino data, including neutrino oscillations, cosmological observations, direct mass measurements, and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Using the most conservative oscillation data, we find that normal ordering is excluded at approximately the 90% confidence level (CL). Incorporating cosmological constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations strengthens this exclusion to about 95% CL, while further including Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data increases it to nearly 99% CL. The inverted ordering is even more strongly disfavored. Our analysis is performed within a frequentist framework, minimizing sensitivity to prior assumptions inherent in Bayesian approaches. These results impose strong constraints on the viability of the minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge model.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter via Charged Lepton Flavor Violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter direct-detection strategy using charged particle decays at accelerator-based experiments. If ultralight $(m_\phi \ll \text{eV})$ dark matter has a misalignment abundance, its local field oscillates in time at a frequency set by its mass. If it also couples to flavor-changing neutral currents, rare exotic decays such as $\mu \to e \phi'$ and $\tau\to e(\mu)\phi'$ inherit this modulation. Focusing on such charged lepton flavor-violating decays, we show that sufficient event samples can enable detection of ultralight dark matter candidates at Mu3e, Belle-II, and FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$. We discuss the importance of the ``effective volume'' needed for the thermodynamics arguments. Our results indicate that the agreement of $b_{\rm UC}$ with $c_s^2$ rather than $P/\varepsilon$ is accidental.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate comparisons between theoretical models and experimental data are critical for scientific progress. However, inferred physical model parameters can vary significantly with the chosen physics model, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for theoretical uncertainties. In this article, we explicitly incorporate these uncertainties using Gaussian processes that model the domain of validity of theoretical models, integrating prior knowledge about where a theory applies and where it does not. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using two systems: a simple ball drop experiment and multi-stage heavy-ion simulations. In both cases incorporating model discrepancy leads to improved parameter estimates, with systematic improvements observed as additional experimental observables are integrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01642v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</description>

      <title>Redshift leverage for the search of GRB neutrinos affected by quantum properties of spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some previous studies based on IceCube neutrinos had found intriguing preliminary evidence that some of them might be GRB neutrinos with travel times affected by quantum properties of spacetime delaying them proportionally to their energy, an effect often labeled as "quantum-spacetime-induced in-vacuo dispersion". Those previous studies looked for candidate GRB neutrinos in a fixed (neutrino-energy-independent) time window after the GRB onset and relied rather crucially on crude estimates of the redshift of GRBs whose redshift has not been measured. We here introduce a complementary approach to the search of quantum-spacetime-affected GRB neutrinos which restricts the analysis to GRBs of sharply known redshift, and, in a way that we argue is synergistic with having sharp information on redshift, adopts a neutrino-energy-dependent time window. We find that knowing the redshift of the GRBs strengthens the analysis enough to compensate for the fact that of course the restriction to GRBs of known redshift reduces the number of candidate GRB neutrinos. And rather remarkably our estimate of the magnitude of the in-vacuo-dispersion effects is fully consistent with what had been found using the previous approach. Our findings are still inconclusive, since their significance is quantified by a $p$-value of little less than $0.01$, but provide motivation for monitoring the accrual of neutrino observations by IceCube and KM3NeT as well as for further refinements of the strategy of analysis here proposed.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical cavity design that bypasses mode mixings in axion haloscope experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities used in axion haloscope experiments typically employ a tuning rod as a means to widen the range of resonance frequencies at which it is sensitive to axion-to-photon conversion. A realistic tuning mechanism requires a gap between the cavity end caps and the tuning rod to ensure movement, and causes some modes to hybridize with the resonant mode that is being tracked for the experiment. These so-called mode mixings lead to gaps in the frequency range that practically lose sensitivity to axions. In order to solve this problem, we present a cavity design which, for two tuning rod configurations corresponding to a lower and higher frequency range, have a dielectric rod inserted at a specific location that makes the cavity asymmetrical. Moving the tuning rod closer to the dielectric insert changes the location and frequency of the mode mixing compared to when it is farther away from it. This design is easily realizable in practical experiments and makes possible an axion dark matter search with minimal loss in sensitivity due to mode mixings. We also show that the same design has the same desired effect when cavity dimensions are scaled down to be smaller and are at higher resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>Dirac Singleton as a Relativistic Field Beyond Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new interpretation of Dirac singletons \cite{Dirac:1963ta}, i.e. free conformal fields in $d$ dimensions, as relativistic fields in a $d+1$-dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, that differs from the Flato-Fronsdal dipole construction in $AdS_{d+1}$ \cite{Flato:1986uh}, is proposed. The $d+1$-dimensional field is described at the level of both equations and Lagrangian. It forms an infinite-dimensional representation of the $d+1$-dimensional Lorentz group that relates fields at different space-time points. The associated well-known fact is that singleton cannot be localized at a point in ${d+1}$ dimensions, hence being unobservable via local scattering/radiation phenomena in the Standard Model ($d=3$). On the other hand, that singleton respects ${d+1}$ dimensional relativistic symmetries makes it possible to introduce its interactions with gravity and other relativistic fields in $d+1$ dimensions. It is speculated that the presence of singleton in a four-dimensional field theory with non-zero cosmological constant (dark energy) can be relevant to the dark matter phenomenon and baryon asymmetry generation.</description>
