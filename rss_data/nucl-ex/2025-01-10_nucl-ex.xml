      <title>Probing Nuclear Excitation by Electron Capture in an Electron Beam Ion Trap with Non-destructive Isomer Detection via Precision Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) is an important nuclear excitation mechanism which still lacks conclusive experimental verification. This is primarily attributed to strong background x-/$\gamma$-ray noise and competing nuclear excitation processes which would overshadow the signals in various environments that NEEC takes place. Here, we propose an experimental approach to observe the NEEC process within a background-free environment. Through collisions with a highly-compressed mono-energetic electron beam in an electron beam ion trap, nuclei may get excited to a long-lived isomeric state via the NEEC process. Subsequently, ions can be extracted and Penning-trap mass spectrometry employed to unambiguously detect the isomer. Our study focuses on the promising candidate $^{189}\mathrm{Os}$, demonstrating measurable detection rates of the NEEC process and discussing the feasibility of the proposed approach. This new approach for observing the NEEC process may be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold dipole strength in {^{10}}Be with isoscalar character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isoscalar dipole transitions are a distinctive fingerprint of cluster structures. A {1^-} resonance at 7.27(10) MeV, located just below the {\alpha}-emission threshold, has been observed in the deuteron inelastic scattering reactions off 10Be. The deformation lengths of the excited states in 10Be below 9 MeV have been inferred from the differential cross sections using coupled channel calculations. This observed {1^-} resonance has isoscalar characteristics and exhausts approximately 5{\%}-15{\%} of the isoscalar dipole energy-weighted sum rule, providing evidence for pronounced {\alpha} cluster structure in 10Be. The Gamow coupled channel approach supports this interpretation and suggests the near-threshold effect might be playing an important role in this excitation energy domain. The {\alpha}+{\alpha}+n+n four-body calculation reproduces the observed enhanced dipole strength, implying that the four-body cluster structure is essential to describe the {1^-} states in 10Be.</description>

      <title>Kinematics Calibration and Excitation Energy Reconstruction for Solenoidal Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solenoidal spectrometers are gaining popularity worldwide due to their large acceptance and superior Q-value resolution in reactions involving radioactive beams. This work introduces a novel recoil energy calibration method leveraging known excited states. Building on this calibration, we describe an algorithm that transforms energy-position data into excitation energy and center-of-mass. This approach has been integrated into the HELIOS online analysis routines, enabling the real-time and speedy generation of excitation energy spectra and angular distributions during experiments.</description>

      <title>Intelligent experiments through real-time AI: Fast Data Processing and Autonomous Detector Control for sPHENIX and future EIC detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This R\&amp;D project, initiated by the DOE Nuclear Physics AI-Machine Learning initiative in 2022, leverages AI to address data processing challenges in high-energy nuclear experiments (RHIC, LHC, and future EIC). Our focus is on developing a demonstrator for real-time processing of high-rate data streams from sPHENIX experiment tracking detectors. The limitations of a 15 kHz maximum trigger rate imposed by the calorimeters can be negated by intelligent use of streaming technology in the tracking system. The approach efficiently identifies low momentum rare heavy flavor events in high-rate p+p collisions (3MHz), using Graph Neural Network (GNN) and High Level Synthesis for Machine Learning (hls4ml). Success at sPHENIX promises immediate benefits, minimizing resources and accelerating the heavy-flavor measurements. The approach is transferable to other fields. For the EIC, we develop a DIS-electron tagger using Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning (AI-ML) algorithms for real-time identification, showcasing the transformative potential of AI and FPGA technologies in high-energy nuclear and particle experiments real-time data processing pipelines.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit correlation and spatial distributions for spin-0 hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-orbit correlation in spin-0 hadrons can be investigated through the kinetic energy-momentum tensor form factor $\tilde F^q(t)$. We observe that the latter is also related to a torque about the radial direction, which we interpret as a chiral stress. If we neglect the quark mass contribution, then $\tilde F^q(t)$ is simply proportional to the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons, and the spin-orbit correlation is equal to minus half of the valence quark number. Given the extensive studies on the electromagnetic form factor for spin-0 hadrons such as pions, kaons, and the $\alpha$ particle, we present the spatial distributions of chiral stress and kinetic spin-orbit correlation based on current parametrizations of the pion electromagnetic form factor.</description>

      <title>Isomeric states of fission fragments explored via Penning trap mass spectrometry at IGISOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of $^{84}$Br, $^{105}$Mo, $^{115,119,121}$Pd, $^{122}$Ag, $^{127,129}$In, $^{132}$Sb and their respective isomeric states have been measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique. The excitation energies of the isomeric states in $^{132}$Sb and $^{119}$Pd were experimentally determined for the first time, while for $^{84}$Br, $^{115}$Pd and $^{127,129}$In, the precision of the mass values was substantially improved. In $^{105}$Mo and $^{121}$Pd there were no signs of a long-lived isomeric state. The ground-state measurements of $^{119}$Pd and $^{122}$Ag indicated that both are significantly more bound than the literature values. For $^{122}$Ag, there was no indication of a proposed third long-lived state. The results for the $N=49$ nucleus $^{84}$Br and isomers close to doubly magic $^{132}$Sn have been compared to the shell-model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model calculations.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the energy-energy correlator in the back-to-back limit using the archived ALEPH $e^{+}e^{-}$ data at 91.2 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, energy-energy correlators (EECs) have garnered renewed interest for studying hadronic collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). EEC measurements within jets provide a clear scale separation, facilitating the study of both perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the collinear limit. These proceedings present recent EEC results from the archived ALEPH $e^{+}e^{-}$ data taken at LEP at $\sqrt{s}$ = 91.2 GeV. In $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions, perturbative and non-perturbative QCD can be studied with EECs in both the collinear limit using jets and the back-to-back limit using all particles as well as the transition between these two regimes. Comparisons of these results to generators and future extensions of this work will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Lattice Effective Field Theory Simulations of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice effective field theory applies the principles of effective field theory in a lattice framework where space and time are discretized. Nucleons are placed on the lattice sites, and the interactions are tuned to replicate the observed features of the nuclear force. Monte Carlo simulations are then employed to predict the properties of nuclear few- and many-body systems. We review the basic methods and several theoretical and algorithmic advances that have been used to further our understanding of atomic nuclei.</description>
