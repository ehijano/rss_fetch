      <title>A Balanced Tree Transformation to Reduce GRAND Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) and its variants, known for their near-maximum likelihood performance, have been introduced in recent years. One such variant, Segmented GRAND, reduces decoding complexity by generating only noise patterns that meet specific constraints imposed by the linear code. In this paper, we introduce a new method to efficiently derive multiple constraints from the parity check matrix. By applying a random invertible linear transformation and reorganizing the matrix into a tree structure, we extract up to log2(n) constraints, reducing the number of decoding queries while maintaining the structure of the original code for a code length of n. We validate the method through theoretical analysis and experimental simulations.</description>

      <title>Angular-Based Hybrid Beamforming for Wideband THz Massive MIMO Systems: Mitigating Beam Split by Leveraging Angular Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam split is a critical challenge in wideband THz massive MIMO systems, arising from frequency-dependent beam misalignment that degrades communication performance, particularly in scenarios with narrow beamwidths and large arrays. This work proposes an angular-based hybrid beamforming framework that leverages angular spread to mitigate the beam split effect. Instead of relying on precise angular spread modeling, we utilize coarse angular information to guide the design of subcarrier-specific beams, effectively reducing misalignment across subcarriers. By broadening the effective beamwidth through angular spread, the proposed method enhances user coverage and alleviates beam split without requiring complex time-delay units or hardware-intensive solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in spectral efficiency and beamforming accuracy while maintaining low computational and hardware complexity. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for addressing beam split in next-generation wideband THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>First Results on UAV-aided User Localization Using ToA and OpenAirInterface in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the challenge of localizing ground users with the help of a radio-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that collects measurements from users. We utilize time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements estimated from the radio signals received from users collected by a UAV at different locations. Since the UAV's location might not be perfectly known, the problem becomes about simultaneously localizing the users and tracking the UAV's position. To solve this problem, we employed a least-squares simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework to fuse ToA data and the estimate of UAV location available from global positioning system (GPS). We verified the performance of the developed algorithm through real-world experimentation.</description>

      <title>Interference Minimization in Beyond-Diagonal RIS-assisted MIMO Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage approach for passive and active beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels (ICs) assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS). In the first stage, the passive BD-RIS is designed to minimize the aggregate interference power at all receivers, a cost function called interference leakage (IL). To this end, we propose an optimization algorithm in the manifold of unitary matrices and a suboptimal but computationally efficient solution. In the second stage, users' active precoders are designed under different criteria such as minimizing the IL (min-IL), maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (max-SINR), or maximizing the sum rate (max-SR). The residual interference not cancelled by the BD-RIS is treated as noise by the precoders. Our simulation results show that the max-SR precoders provide more than 20% sum rate improvement compared to other designs, especially when the BD-RIS has a moderate number of elements ($M&lt;20$) and users transmit with high power, in which case the residual interference is still significant.</description>

      <title>Perception-Enhanced Multitask Multimodal Semantic Communication for UAV-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled their widespread deployment in critical applications such as emergency management. This paper investigates the challenge of efficient multitask multimodal data communication in UAV-assisted ISAC systems, in the considered system model, hyperspectral (HSI) and LiDAR data are collected by UAV-mounted sensors for both target classification and data reconstruction at the terrestrial BS. The limited channel capacity and complex environmental conditions pose significant challenges to effective air-to-ground communication. To tackle this issue, we propose a perception-enhanced multitask multimodal semantic communication (PE-MMSC) system that strategically leverages the onboard computational and sensing capabilities of UAVs. In particular, we first propose a robust multimodal feature fusion method that adaptively combines HSI and LiDAR semantics while considering channel noise and task requirements. Then the method introduces a perception-enhanced (PE) module incorporating attention mechanisms to perform coarse classification on UAV side, thereby optimizing the attention-based multimodal fusion and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5\%--10\% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems without PE module, while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads.</description>

      <title>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes learning-based approaches for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</description>

      <title>Detecting Arbitrary Planted Subgraphs in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems of detecting and recovering planted structures/subgraphs in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, have received significant attention over the past three decades, leading to many exciting results and mathematical techniques. However, prior work has largely focused on specific ad hoc planted structures and inferential settings, while a general theory has remained elusive. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating the detection of an \emph{arbitrary} planted subgraph $\Gamma = \Gamma_n$ in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\mathcal{G}(n, q_n)$, where the edge probability within $\Gamma$ is $p_n$. We examine both the statistical and computational aspects of this problem and establish the following results. In the dense regime, where the edge probabilities $p_n$ and $q_n$ are fixed, we tightly characterize the information-theoretic and computational thresholds for detecting $\Gamma$, and provide conditions under which a computational-statistical gap arises. Most notably, these thresholds depend on $\Gamma$ only through its number of edges, maximum degree, and maximum subgraph density. Our lower and upper bounds are general and apply to any value of $p_n$ and $q_n$ as functions of $n$. Accordingly, we also analyze the sparse regime where $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$ and $p_n-q_n =\Theta(q_n)$, with $\alpha\in[0,2]$, as well as the critical regime where $p_n=1-o(1)$ and $q_n = \Theta(n^{-\alpha})$, both of which have been widely studied, for specific choices of $\Gamma$. For these regimes, we show that our bounds are tight for all planted subgraphs investigated in the literature thus far\textemdash{}and many more. Finally, we identify conditions under which detection undergoes sharp phase transition, where the boundaries at which algorithms succeed or fail shift abruptly as a function of $q_n$.</description>

      <title>Factorizations of relative entropy using stochastic localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive entropy factorization estimates for spin systems using the stochastic localization approach proposed by Eldan and Chen-Eldan, which, in this context, is equivalent to the renormalization group approach developed independently by Bauerschmidt, Bodineau, and Dagallier. The method provides approximate Shearer-type inequalities for the corresponding Gibbs measure at sufficiently high temperature, without restrictions on the degree of the underlying graph. For Ising systems, these are shown to hold up to the critical tree-uniqueness threshold, including polynomial bounds at the critical point, with optimal $O(\sqrt n)$ constants for the Curie-Weiss model at criticality. In turn, these estimates imply tight mixing time bounds for arbitrary block dynamics or Gibbs samplers, improving over existing results. Moreover, we establish new tensorization statements for the Shearer inequality asserting that if a system consists of weakly interacting but otherwise arbitrary components, each of which satisfies an approximate Shearer inequality, then the whole system also satisfies such an estimate.</description>

      <title>RCC-PFL: Robust Client Clustering under Noisy Labels in Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models. The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar. A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions. This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge. A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods. We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</description>

Abstract: The heat equation is often used in order to inpaint dropped data in inpainting-based lossy compression schemes. We propose an alternative way to numerically solve the heat equation by an extended Krylov subspace method. The method is very efficient with respect to the direct computation of the solution of the heat equation at large times. And this is exactly what is needed for decoding edge-compressed pictures by homogeneous diffusion.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RIS With Sub-Connected Active Partitions: Performance Analysis and Transmission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging reflecting intelligent surface (RIS) technology promises to enhance the capacity of wireless communication systems via passive reflect beamforming. However, the product path loss limits its performance gains. Fully-connected (FC) active RIS, which integrates reflect-type power amplifiers into the RIS elements, has been recently introduced in response to this issue. Also, sub-connected (SC) active RIS and hybrid FC-active/passive RIS variants, which employ a limited number of reflect-type power amplifiers, have been proposed to provide energy savings. Nevertheless, their flexibility in balancing diverse capacity requirements and power consumption constraints is limited. In this direction, this study introduces novel hybrid RIS structures, wherein at least one reflecting sub-surface (RS) adopts the SC-active RIS design. The asymptotic signal-to-noise-ratio of the FC-active/passive and the proposed hybrid RIS variants is analyzed in a single-user single-input single-output setup. Furthermore, the transmit and RIS beamforming weights are jointly optimized in each scenario to maximize the energy efficiency of a hybrid RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system subject to the power consumption constraints of the base station and the active RSs. Numerical simulation and analytic results highlight the performance gains of the proposed RIS designs over benchmarks, unveil non-trivial trade-offs, and provide valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Codes for Limited-Magnitude Probability Error in DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA, with remarkable properties of high density, durability, and replicability, is one of the most appealing storage media. Emerging DNA storage technologies use composite DNA letters, where information is represented by probability vectors, leading to higher information density and lower synthesizing costs than regular DNA letters. However, it faces the problem of inevitable noise and information corruption. This paper explores the channel of composite DNA letters in DNA-based storage systems and introduces block codes for limited-magnitude probability errors on probability vectors. First, outer and inner bounds for limited-magnitude probability error correction codes are provided. Moreover, code constructions are proposed where the number of errors is bounded by t, the error magnitudes are bounded by l, and the probability resolution is fixed as k. These constructions focus on leveraging the properties of limited-magnitude probability errors in DNA-based storage systems, leading to improved performance in terms of complexity and redundancy. In addition, the asymptotic optimality for one of the proposed constructions is established. Finally, systematic codes based on one of the proposed constructions are presented, which enable efficient information extraction for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>On Improving the Composition Privacy Loss in Differential Privacy for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of disjoint subsets of a dataset, in the setting of data heterogeneity, where users could contribute more than one sample, with different users contributing potentially different numbers of samples. In particular, we focus on the $\epsilon$-differentially private release of sample means and variances of sample values in disjoint subsets of a dataset, under the assumption that the numbers of contributions of each user in each subset is publicly known. Our main contribution is an iterative algorithm, based on suppressing user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the worst estimation error among the subsets. Important components of this analysis are our exact, analytical characterizations of the sensitivities and the worst-case bias errors of estimators of the sample mean and variance, which are obtained by clipping or suppressing user contributions. We test the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic datasets and demonstrate clear improvements in the privacy loss degradation, for fixed worst-case estimation error.</description>
