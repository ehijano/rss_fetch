      <title>Lipschitz regularity for almost minimizers of a one-phase $p$-Bernoulli-type functional in Carnot Groups of step two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, in a Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$ of step $2$ and homogeneous dimension $Q$, we prove that almost minimizers of the (horizontal) one-phase $p$-Bernoulli-type functional
  $$ J_p(u,\Omega):=\int_{\Omega}\Big( |\nabla_{\mathbb{G}} u(x)|^p+\chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}(x)\Big)\,dx$$ whenever $p&gt;p^\#:=\frac{2Q}{Q+2}$, are locally Lipschitz continuous with respect Carnot-Carath\'eodory distance on $\mathbb{G}$. This implies an H\"older continuous regularity from an Euclidean point of view.</description>

      <title>A new characterization of the dissipation structure and the relaxation limit for the compressible Euler-Maxwell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional compressible Euler-Maxwell system, a model for simulating the transport of electrons interacting with propagating electromagnetic waves in semiconductor devices. First, we show the global well-posedness of classical solutions being a sharp small perturbation of constant equilibrium in a critical regularity setting, uniformly with respect to the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then, for all times $t&gt;0$, we derive quantitative error estimates at the rate $O(\varepsilon)$ between the rescaled Euler-Maxwell system and the limit drift-diffusion model. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first global-in-time strong convergence for the relaxation procedure in the case of ill-prepared data.
  In order to prove our results, we develop a new characterization of the dissipation structure for the linearized Euler-Maxwell system with respect to the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon$. This is done by partitioning the frequency space into three distinct regimes: low, medium and high frequencies, each associated with a different behaviour of the solution. Then, in each regime, the use of efficient unknowns and Lyapunov functionals based on the hypocoercivity theory leads to uniform a priori estimates.</description>

      <title>On the near soliton dynamics for the 2D cubic Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Cauchy problem for the cubic (mass-critical) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equations in dimension two: $$\partial_t u+\partial_{x_1}(\Delta u+u^3)=0,\quad (t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^{2}.$$ For initial data in $H^1$ close to the soliton with a suitable space-decay property, we fully describe the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding solution. More precisely, for such initial data, we show that only three possible behaviors can occur: 1) The solution leaves a tube near soliton in finite time; 2) the solution blows up in finite time; 3) the solution is global and locally converges to a soliton. In addition, we show that for initial data near a soliton with non-positive energy and above the threshold mass, the corresponding solution will blow up as described in Case 2.
  Our proof is inspired by the techniques developed for mass-critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation (gKdV) equation in a similar context by Martel-Merle-Rapha\"el. More precisely, our proof relies on refined modulation estimates and a modified energy-virial Lyapunov functional. The primary challenge in our problem is the lack of coercivity of the Schr\"odinger operator which appears in the virial-type estimate. To overcome the difficulty, we apply a transform, which was first introduced in Kenig-Martel [13], to perform the virial computations after converting the original problem to the adjoint one. Th coercivity of the Schr\"odinger operator in the adjoint problem has been numerically verified by Farah-Holmer-Roudenko-Yang [9].</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling waves to Benjamin-Ono type equations with double power nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of travelling wave solutions to dispersion generalized Benjamin--Ono type equations with the double power nonlinearities $|u|^{p-1}u + |u|^{q-1}u \ (1 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; \infty)$. We prove that travelling wave solutions constructed by ground states are stable if $p$ is $L^{2}$-subcritical and speeds of waves are sufficiently small by showing the coercivity of the linearized operator around ground states, which is introduced by Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss (1987).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a critical Grushin-type problem with double potentials. By applying the reduction argument and local Poho\u{z}aev identities, we construct a new family of solutions to this problem, which are concentrated at points lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder.</description>

      <title>On selection dynamics for a nonlocal phenotype-structured model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the analysis of the long-time behavior of a phenotypic-structured model where phenotypic changes do not occur. We give a mathematical description of the process in which the best adapted trait is selected in a given environment created by the total population. It is exhibited that the long-time limit of the unique solution to the nonlocal equation is given by a Dirac mass centered at the peak of the fitness within or at the boundary of the region where the initial data is positive. Specially, If the peak of the fitness can't be in the support of the solution, then the infinite time blow-up of the solution occurs near the boundary of the region where the solution is positive. Moreover, our numerical results facilitate a deeper understanding of identifying the position of the centers.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion systems in annular domains: source stability estimates with boundary observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider systems of reaction-diffusion equations coupled in zero order terms, with general homogeneous boundary conditions in domains with a particular geometry (annular type domains). We establish Lipschitz stability estimates in L^2 norm for the source in terms of the solution and/or its normal derivative on a connected component of the boundary. The main tools are represented by: appropriate Carleman estimates in L^2 norms, with boundary observations, and positivity improving properties for the solutions to parabolic equations and systems.</description>

      <title>Forward and backward problems for coupled subdiffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate both forward and backward problems for coupled systems of time-fractional diffusion equations, encompassing scenarios of strong coupling. For the forward problem, we establish the well-posedness of the system, leveraging the eigensystem of the corresponding elliptic system as the foundation. When considering the backward problem, specifically the determination of initial values through final time observations, we demonstrate a Lipschitz stability estimate, which is consist with the stability observed in the case of a single equation. To numerically address this backward problem, we refer to the explicit formulation of Tikhonov regularization to devise a multi-channel neural network architecture. This innovative architecture offers a versatile approach, exhibiting its efficacy in multidimensional settings through numerical examples and its robustness in handling initial values that have not been trained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence and uniqueness of the maximal pathwise solution for an abstract nonlinear stochastic evolutional equation, which takes the two and three dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations as a typical model, forced by a multiplicative white noise, and show that the pathwise solution exists globally in time in a positive probability when the initial data is sufficiently small. Moreover, a global pathwise solution is obtained for the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations defined on torus when the data is properly regular and small.</description>

      <title>On $C^1$ regularity for degenerate elliptic equations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Lipschitz solutions $u$ of $\mathrm{div}\, G(\nabla u)=0$ in $B_1\subset\mathbb R^2$ are $C^1$, for strictly monotone vector fields $G\in C^0(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb R^2)$ satisfying a mild ellipticity condition. If $G=\nabla F$ for a strictly convex function $F$, and $0\leq \lambda(\xi)\leq \Lambda(\xi)$ are the two eigenvalues of $\nabla^2 F(\xi)$, our assumption is that the set $\lbrace\lambda=0\rbrace \cap \lbrace \Lambda=\infty\rbrace$, where ellipticity degenerates $both$ from below and from above, is finite. This extends results by De Silva and Savin (Duke Math. J. 151, No. 3, p.487-532, 2010), which assumed either that set empty, or the larger set $\lbrace \lambda=0\rbrace$ finite. Our main new input is to transfer estimates in $\lbrace \lambda &gt; 0 \rbrace $ to estimates in $\lbrace \Lambda &lt;\infty\rbrace$ by means of a conjugate equation. When $G$ is not a gradient, the ellipticity assumption needs to be interpreted in a specific way, and we highlight the nontrivial effect of the antisymmetric part of $\nabla G$.</description>

      <title>On a critical Hamiltonian system with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Hamiltonian system with Neumann boundary conditions: \[ -\Delta u + \mu u=v^{q }, \quad -\Delta v+ \mu v=u^{p} \quad \text{ in $\Omega$}, \qquad
  u, v &gt;0 \quad \text{ in $\Omega$,} \qquad \partial_\nu u= \partial_\nu v=0 \quad \text{ on $\partial \Omega$, } \] where $\mu &gt;0$ is a parameter and $\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb R^N .$
  When $(p, q)$ approaches from below the critical hyperbola $N/(p+1) + N/(q+1)=N-2$, we build a solution which blows-up at a boundary point where the mean curvature achieves its minimum and negative value.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of weak solutions to degenerate Kolmogorov equations of hypoelliptic type in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the boundedness of weak subsolutions for a class of degenerate Kolmogorov equations of hypoelliptic type, compatible with a homogeneous Lie group structure, within bounded product domains using the De Giorgi iteration. We employ the renormalization formula to handle boundary values and provide energy estimates. An $L^1$-$L^p$ type embedding estimate derived from the fundamental solution is utilized to incorporate lower-order divergence terms. This work naturally extends the boundedness theory for uniformly parabolic equations, with matching exponents for the coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the momentum formulation of the two-dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations forced by random noise, of both additive and linear multiplicative types. For any prescribed deterministic function under some conditions, we construct solutions to each system whose energy is the fixed function. Consequently, we prove non-uniqueness of almost sure Markov selections of suitable class of weak solutions associated to the momentum surface quasi-geostrophic equations in both cases of noise.</description>

Abstract: We provide a sharp $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimate up to the boundary for a viscosity solution of a degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic equation with the oblique boundary condition on a $C^1$ domain. To this end, we first obtain a uniform boundary H{\"o}lder estimate with the oblique boundary condition in an "almost $C^1$-flat" domain for the equations which is uniformly elliptic only where the gradient is far from some point, and then we establish a desired $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity based on perturbation and compactness arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cross-diffusion system with Lotka-Volterra reaction terms in a bounded domain with no-flux boundary conditions is analyzed. The system is a nonlocal regularization of a generalized Busenberg-Travis model, which describes segregating population species with local averaging. The partial velocities are the solutions of an elliptic regularization of Darcy's law, which can be interpreted as a Brinkman's law. The following results are proved: the existence of global weak solutions; localization limit; boundedness and uniqueness of weak solutions (in one space dimension); exponential decay of the solutions. Moreover, the weak-strong uniqueness property for the limiting system is shown.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation by harmonic polynomials for solving the Dirichlet problem of Laplace's equation on a disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation in an open disk. The uniqueness of solutions is ensured by the well-known weak maximum principle. We introduce a novel approach to demonstrate the existence of a solution using harmonic polynomials that converge uniformly to a solution. Specifically, we rigorously derive the convergence rate of the harmonic polynomials and show that smoother boundary data and proximity of the target point to the disk's origin accelerate the convergence. Additionally, we obtain uniform estimates for the derivatives of solutions of arbitrary orders, controlled by $L^1$-boundary data. Notably, the constants in our estimates are significantly improved compared to existing results. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced radius of convergence for Taylor's series of the solution at each point in the open disk.</description>

Abstract: In this work we prove that given an open bounded set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with a $C^2$ boundary, there exists $\epsilon := \epsilon(\Omega)$ small enough such that for all $0 &lt; \delta &lt; \epsilon$ the maximum of $\{\lambda_1(\Omega - B_{\delta}(x)):B_{\delta} \subset \Omega\}$ is never attained when the ball is close enough to the boundary. In particular it is not obtained when $B_\delta(x)$ is touching the boundary $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>Curvilinear High-Order Mimetic Differences that Satisfy Conservation Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the construction and usage of mimetic operators in curvilinear staggered grids. Specifically, we extend the Corbino-Castillo operators so they can be utilized to solve problems in non-trivial geometries. We prove that the resulting curvilinear operators satisfy the discrete analog of the extended Gauss-Divergence theorem. In addition, we demonstrate energy and mass conservation in curvilinear coordinates for the acoustic wave equation. These findings are illustrated in two-dimensional and three-dimensional elliptic/hyperbolic equations and can be extended to other partial differential equations as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the well-posedness of the family of dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. Earlier work of Herr-Ionescu-Kenig-Koch established well-posedness with data in $L^2$, by using a discretized gauge transform in the setting of Bourgain spaces. In this article, we remain in the simpler functional setting of Sobolev spaces, and instead combine a pseudodifferential gauge transform, a paradifferential normal form, and a variable coefficient Strichartz analysis to establish well-posedness in negative-exponent Sobolev spaces. Our result coincides with the classical well-posedness results obtained at the Benjamin-Ono and KdV endpoints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we improve the accuracy of several known algorithms to address the classification of large datasets when few labels are available. Our framework lies in the realm of graph-based semi-supervised learning. With novel modifications on Gaussian Random Fields Learning and Poisson Learning algorithms, we increase the accuracy and create more robust algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed methods over conventional graph-based semi-supervised techniques, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantitative relative entropy estimates for interacting particle systems with common noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates proving the conditional propagation of chaos for large stochastic systems of interacting particles subject to both idiosyncratic and common noise. We obtain explicit bounds on the relative entropy between the conditional Liouville equation and the stochastic Fokker--Planck equation with an interaction kernel \(k\in L^2(\R^d) \cap L^\infty(\R^d)\), extending far beyond the Lipschitz case. Our method relies on reducing the problem to the idiosyncratic setting, which allows us to utilize the exponential law of large numbers by Jabin and Wang~\cite{JabinWang2018} in a pathwise manner.</description>

      <title>The geometric size of the fundamental gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental gap conjecture proved by Andrews and Clutterbuck in 2011 provides the sharp lower bound for the difference between the first two Dirichlet Laplacian eigenvalues in terms of the diameter of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^N$. The question concerning the rigidity of the inequality, raised by Yau in 1990, was left open. Going beyond rigidity, our main result strengthens Andrews-Clutterbuck inequality, by quantifying geometrically the excess of the gap compared to the diameter in terms of flatness. The proof relies on a localized, variational interpretation of the fundamental gap, allowing a dimension reduction via the use of convex partitions \`a la Payne-Weinberger: the result stems by combining a new sharp result for one dimensional Schr\"odinger eigenvalues with measure potentials, with a thorough analysis of the geometry of the partition into convex cells. As a by-product of our approach, we obtain a quantitative form of Payne-Weinberger inequality for the first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue of a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^N$, thus proving, in a stronger version, a conjecture from 2007 by Hang-Wang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion fronts in spatially periodic bistable media with large periods. Whereas the homogenization regime associated with small periods had been well studied for bistable or Fisher-KPP reactions and, in the latter case, a formula for the limit minimal speeds of fronts in media with large periods had also been obtained thanks to the linear formulation of these minimal speeds and their monotonicity with respect to the period, the main remaining open question is concerned with fronts in bistable environments with large periods. In bistable media the unique front speeds are not linearly determined and are not monotone with respect to the spatial period in general, making the analysis of the limit of large periods more intricate. We show in this paper the existence of and an explicit formula for the limit of bistable front speeds as the spatial period goes to infinity. We also prove that the front profiles converge to a family of front profiles associated with spatially homogeneous equations. The main results are based on uniform estimates on the spatial width of the fronts, which themselves use zero number properties and intersection arguments.</description>

Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with the spatial variable in a closed convex cone. A monotonicity assumption on the nonlinearity allows us to prescribe no condition on the boundary of the cone. We show the well-posedness of the equation in the viscosity sense and prove several properties of the solution: monotonicity, Lipschitzness, and representations by variational formulas.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate to equilibrium for conservative scattering models on the torus: a new tauberian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The object of this paper is to provide a new and systematic tauberian approach to quantitative long time behaviour of $C_{0}$-semigroups $\left(\mathcal{V}(t)\right)_{t \geq0}$ in $L^{1}(\mathbb{T}^{d}\times \mathbb{R}^{d})$ governing conservative linear kinetic equations on the torus with general scattering kernel $ {k}(v,v')$ and degenerate (i.e. not bounded away from zero) collision frequency $\sigma(v)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} {k}(v',v)m(\mathrm{d} v')$, (with $m(\mathrm{d} v)$ being absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure). We show in particular that if $N_{0}$ is the maximal integer $s \geq0$ such that $$\frac{1}{\sigma(\cdot)}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}k(\cdot,v)\sigma^{-s}(v)m(\mathrm{d} v) \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$$ then, for initial datum $f$ such that $\mathrm{d} s\int_{\mathbb{T}^{d}\times \mathbb{R}^{d}}|f(x,v)|\sigma^{-N_{0}}(v)\mathrm{d} x m(\mathrm{d} v) &lt;\infty$ it holds $$\left\|\mathcal{V}(t)f-\varrho_{f}\Psi\right\|_{L^{1}}=\dfrac{{\epsilon}_{f}(t)}{(1+t)^{N_{0}-1}}, \qquad \varrho_{f}:= \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}}f(x,v)m(\mathrm{d} v)$$ where $\Psi$ is the unique invariant density of $\left(\mathcal{V}(t)\right)_{t \geq0}$ and $\lim_{t\to\infty}{\epsilon}_{f}(t)=0$. We in particular provide a new criteria of the existence of invariant density. The proof relies on the explicit computation of the time decay of each term of the Dyson-Phillips expansion of $\mathcal{V}(t)$ and on suitable smoothness and integrability properties of the trace on the imaginary axis of Laplace transform of remainders of large order of this Dyson-Phillips expansion. Our construction resorts also on collective compactness arguments and provides various technical results of independent interest. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we derive essentially sharp ``subgeometric'' convergence rate for Markov semigroups associated to general transition kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the large-time behavior of bounded solutions of the Cauchy problem for a reaction-diffusion equation in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with bistable reaction term. We consider initial conditions that are chiefly indicator functions of bounded Borel sets. We examine how geometric transformations of the supports of these initial conditions affect the propagation or extinction of the solutions at large time. We also consider two fragmentation indices defined in the set of bounded Borel sets and we establish some propagation or extinction results when the initial supports are weakly or highly fragmented. Lastly, we show that the large-time dynamics of the solutions is not monotone with respect to the considered fragmentation indices, even for equimeasurable sets.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behaviour of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $d$-dimensional non-compact manifold $(\mathcal{M},g)$ which satisfies bounded conditions on curvature tensors. We use certain exponential dipsersive estimates of the Stokes semigroup to prove Massera-type principles which guarantees the well-posedness of almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic mild solutions for the inhomogeneous Stokes equations. Then, by using fixed point arguments and Gronwall's inequality we establish the well-posedness and exponential decay for global-in-time of such solutions of Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the large-time dynamics of bounded solutions of reaction-diffusion equations with bounded or unbounded initial support in R N. We start with a survey of some old and recent results on the spreading speeds of the solutions and their asymptotic local one-dimensional symmetry. We then derive some flattening properties of the level sets of the solutions if initially supported on subgraphs. We also investigate the special case of asymptotically conical-shaped initial conditions. Lastly, we reclaim some known results about the logarithmic lag between the position of the solutions and that of planar or spherical fronts expanding with minimal speed, for almost-planar or compactly supported initial conditions. We then prove some new logarithmic-in-time estimates of the lag of the position of the solutions with respect to that of a planar front, for initial conditions which are supported on subgraphs with logarithmic growth at infinity. These estimates entail in particular that the same lag as for compactly supported initial data holds true for a class of unbounded initial supports. The paper also contains some related conjectures and open problems.</description>

Abstract: This article presents an investigation of global properties of a class of differential operators on $\mathbb{T}^1\times\mathbb{R}$. Our approach involves the utilization of a mixed Fourier transform, incorporating both partial Fourier series on the torus and partial Fourier transform in Euclidean space. By examining the behaviour of the mixed Fourier coefficients, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the Schwartz global hypoellipticity of this class of differential operators, as well as conditions for the Schwartz global solvability of said operators.</description>

Abstract: We study the Cauhcy problem for space-time fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general nonlinearity. We prove the local well-posedness of it in fractional Sobolev spaces based on the decay estimates and H\"older type estimates. Due to the lack of the semigroup structure of the solution operators, we deduce the decay estimates and H\"older type estimates via the asymptotic expansion of the Mittag-Leffler functions and Bessel functions. In particular, these results also show the dispersion of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local well-posedness is established for a highly nonlocal nonlinear diffusion-adhesion system for bounded initial values with small support. Macroscopic systems of this kind were previously obtained by the authors through upscaling in [32] and can account for the effect of microscopic receptor binding dynamics in cell-cell adhesion. The system analysed here couples an integro-PDE featuring degenerate diffusion of the porous media type and nonlocal adhesion with a novel nonlinear integral equation. The approach is based on decoupling the system and using Banach's fixed point theorem to solve each of the two equations individually and subsequently the entire system. The main challenge of the implementation lies in selecting a suitable framework. One of the key results is the local well-posedness for the integral equation with a Radon measure as a parameter. The analysis of this equation utilizes the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm, marking the first application of this norm in handling a nonlinear integral equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the notion of grouped dispersal that have been introduced by Soubeyrand and co-authors \cite{soubeyrand2011patchy} to model the simultaneous (and hence dependent) dispersal  of several propagules from a single source  in a homogeneous  environment. We built a time continuous  measure valued process that takes into account the main feature of a grouped dispersal and derive its infinitesimal generator. To cope with the mutligeneration aspect associated to the demography we introduce  two types of propagules in the description of  the population which is one of  the main innovations here.  We also provide a rigorous description of the process and its generator. We derive  as well, some large population asymptotics of the process unveilling the  degenerate ultra parabolic system of PDE satisfied by the density of population. Finally, we also show that such a PDE system has a non-trivial solution which is unique in a certain functional space.</description>

Abstract: We study the uniqueness of solutions of the initial-boundary value problem in the quarter-plane for the chemical flood conservation law system in the class of piece-wise $\mathcal C^1$-smooth functions under certain restrictions. The vanishing viscosity method is used locally on the discontinuities of the solution to determine admissible and inadmissible shocks. The Lagrange coordinate transformation is utilized in order to split the equations. The proof of uniqueness is based on an entropy inequality similar to the one used in the classical Kru\v{z}kov's theorem.</description>

      <title>On existence of Sadovskii vortex patch: A touching pair of symmetric counter-rotating uniform vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sadovskii vortex patch is a traveling wave for the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations consisting of an odd symmetric pair of vortex patches touching the symmetry axis. Its existence was first suggested by numerical computations of Sadovskii in [J. Appl. Math. Mech., 1971], and has gained significant interest due to its relevance in inviscid limit of planar flows via Prandtl--Batchelor theory and as the asymptotic state for vortex ring dynamics. In this work, we prove the existence of a Sadovskii vortex patch, by solving the energy maximization problem under the exact impulse condition and an upper bound on the circulation.</description>

      <title>Global counterexamples to uniqueness for a Calder\'on problem with $C^k$ conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset R^n$, $n \geq 3$, be a fixed smooth bounded domain, and let $\gamma$ be a smooth conductivity in $\overline{\Omega}$. Consider a non-zero frequency $\lambda_0$ which does not belong to the Dirichlet spectrum of $L_\gamma = -{\rm div} (\gamma \nabla \cdot)$. Then, for all $k \geq 1$, there exists an infinite number of pairs of non-isometric $C^k$ conductivities $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ on $\overline{\Omega}$, which are close to $\gamma$ such that the associated DN maps at frequency $\lambda_0$ satisfy \begin{equation*}
  \Lambda_{\gamma_1,\lambda_0} = \Lambda_{\gamma_2,\lambda_0}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>Existence of solution of a triangular degenerate reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study a chemical reaction-diffusion system with $m$ unknown concentration. The non-linearity in our study comes from a particular chemical reaction where one unit of a particular species generated from other $m-1$ species and disintegrates to generate all those $m-1$ species in the same manner, i.e., triangular in nature. Our objective is to find whether global in time solution exists for this system where one or more species stops diffusing. In particular weak global in time solution exists for all the degenerate cases in any dimension. We are further able to show classical global in time solution exists for all the degenerate cases in any dimension except one and this particular case too attain classical global in time solution up to dimension $2$. We also analyze global in time existence result for the case of quadratic non-linear rate functions and also analyze a three dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Geometry of complete minimal surfaces at infinity and the Willmore index of their inversions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14367v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study complete minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with finite total curvature and embedded planar ends. After conformal compactification via inversion, these yield examples of surfaces stationary for the Willmore bending energy $\mathcal{W}: =\frac{1}{4} \int|\vec H|^2$. In codimension one, we prove that the $\mathcal{W}$-Morse index for any inverted minimal sphere or real projective plane with $m$ such ends is exactly $m-3=\frac{\mathcal{W}}{4\pi}-3$. We also consider several geometric properties -- for example, the property that all $m$ asymptotic planes meet at a single point -- of these minimal surfaces and explore their relation to the $\mathcal{W}$-Morse index of their inverted surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $\alpha\geq 2$, we investigate a class of Fourier extension operators on fractional surfaces $(\xi,|\xi|^\alpha)$. For the corresponding $\alpha$-Strichartz inequalities, by applying the missing mass method and bilinear restriction theory, we characterize the precompactness of extremal sequences. Our result is valid in any dimension. In particular for dimension two, our result implies the existence of extremals for $\alpha \in [2,\alpha_0)$ with some $\alpha_0&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits for fractional polyharmonic Gaussian fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Full $\Gamma$-expansion of reversible Markov chains level two large deviations rate functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Xi_n \subset \mathbb R^d$, $n\ge 1$, be a sequence of finite sets and consider a $\Xi_n$-valued, irreducible, reversible, continuous-time Markov chain $(X^{(n)}_t:t\ge 0)$. Denote by $\mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) $ the set of probability measures on $\mathbb R^d$ and by $I_n\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty)$ the level two large deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$ as $t\to\infty$. We present a general method, based on tools used to prove the metastable behaviour of Markov chains, to derive a full expansion of $I_n$ expressing it as $I_n = I^{(0)} \,+\, \sum_{1\le p\le q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_n)\, I^{(p)}$, where $I^{(p)}\colon \mathscr P(\mathbb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ represent rate functionals independent of $n$ and $\theta^{(p)}_n$ sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_n \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_n / \theta^{(p+1)}_n \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; q$. The speed $\theta^{(p)}_n$ corresponds to the time-scale at which the Markov chains $X^{(n)}_t$ exhibits a metastable behavior, and the $I^{(p-1)}$ zero-level sets to the metastable states. To illustrate the theory we apply the method to random walks in potential fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We collect a number of elementary constructions of $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms, and of families of these objects. These examples show that the branching set $\Sigma$ of a $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic 1-form may exhibit the following features: i) $\Sigma$ may be a non-trivial link; ii) $\Sigma$ may be a multiple cover; iii) $\Sigma$ may be immersed, and appear as a limit of smoothly embedded branching loci; iv) there are families of $\mathbb Z_2$ harmonic $1$-forms whose branching sets $\Sigma$ have tangent cones filling out a positive dimensional space, even modulo isometries.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the dynamics of a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field and study the regime where the field's propagation speed approaches infinity. For initial states devoid of field excitations, we introduce an effective approximation of the time-evolved wave function and prove its validity in Hilbert space norm. In this approximation, the field remains in the vacuum state while the tracer particle propagates with a modified dispersion relation. Physically, the new dispersion relation can be understood as the effect of radiative corrections due to interactions with virtual bosons. Mathematically, it is defined as the solution of a self-consistent equation, whose form depends on the relevant time scale.</description>
