      <title>Epigenetic Control and Reprogramming-Induced Potential Landscapes of Gene Regulatory Networks: A Quantitative Theoretical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory framework to analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) incorporating epigenetic modifications. Building on the Hopfield network model analogy to spin glass systems, our approach introduces dynamic terms representing DNA methylation and histone modification to capture their regulatory influence on gene expression. The resulting formulation reduces high-dimensional GRN dynamics to effective stochastic equations, enabling the characterization of both stable and oscillatory states in epigenetically regulated systems. This framework provides a tractable and quantitative method for linking gene regulatory dynamics with epigenetic control, offering new theoretical insights into developmental processes and cell fate decisions.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Oscillatory Regimes of Global Synchrony Induced by Secondary Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization systems with effective inertia, such as power grid networks and coupled electromechanical oscillators, are commonly modeled by the second-order Kuramoto model. In the forward process, numerical simulations exhibit a staircase-like growth of global synchrony, reflecting temporal oscillations induced by secondary synchronized clusters of whirling oscillators. While this behavior has been observed previously, its governing conditions have not been quantitatively determined in terms of analytical criteria. Here, we develop a self-consistent theoretical framework that explicitly characterizes the secondary synchronized clusters. This analysis identifies an onset crossover mass $\tilde{m}^* \simeq 3.865$ for the emergence of secondary clusters and yields quantitative criteria for predicting both the crossover mass and the termination coupling strength at which they vanish. As a result, we determine the oscillatory regimes of coupling strengths over which global synchrony shows temporal oscillations, providing practical guidance for controlling and avoiding undesirable oscillatory behavior in inertial synchronization systems, such as power grids.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Loop Stabilization in Periodically Driven Elastic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamic bifurcation of Resch-patterned origami for self-adaptive impact mitigation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in impact mitigation is the development of versatile and omnifarious protective structures capable of encompassing a wide spectrum of scenarios, for example, ranging from low-speed pedestrian impacts to high-speed vehicle collisions. However, most existing impact mitigation strategies rely on fixed geometries or pre-tuned material properties targeting specific impact speed, lacking the ability to adapt in real time. Here, we draw inspiration from origami to design impact mitigation structures that exhibit multi-modal and self-adaptive behavior. We introduce a Resch-patterned origami structure that hosts two distinctive deformation modes: a monostable folding mode and a bistable unfolding mode featuring snap-through. Impact experiments reveal a speed-dependent dynamic bifurcation, wherein the structure autonomously switches between folding and unfolding in response to the applied impact velocity. This dynamic bifurcation, intrinsically distinct from kinematic or static origami bifurcations, enables real-time selection of deformation pathways that enhance energy dissipation across a broad range of impact conditions. We further demonstrate the scalability and practical relevance of this mechanism by fabricating tessellations in a bumper-like configuration and evaluating their performance using a pendulum-based mannequin impact test. Together, these results establish dynamic bifurcation in origami-based structures as an adaptive impact mitigation strategy. This approach enables scalable and programmable protective systems that autonomously select deformation modes in real time, with broad relevance to adaptive robotics, smart protective armor, and aerospace damping technologies.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling indicates that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results indicate that chiral active matter should strictly be considered a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>
