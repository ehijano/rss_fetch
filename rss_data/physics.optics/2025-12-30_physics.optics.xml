      <title>Self-referenced nonlinear interferometry for chromatic dispersion sensing across multiple length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromatic dispersion critically impacts the performance of numerous applications ranging from telecommunication links to ultrafast optics and nonlinear devices, yet fast and precise measurements are challenging, especially for short length-dispersion products. We present a fully fiber-integrated nonlinear Sagnac interferometer that exploits cascaded second-order processes to generate frequency-anticorrelated idler light and achieve odd-order dispersion cancellation without active stabilization. The measurement is intrinsically self-referenced, as the dispersion-induced phase is extracted from the interference between counter-propagating nonlinear processes within the same Sagnac loop, eliminating the need for an external reference arm or prior calibration. Operating entirely at telecom wavelengths and read out on a standard optical spectrum analyzer, the device produces instantaneous, high-visibility fringes and calibration-free spectra using dual-port normalization. We demonstrate chromatic dispersion measurements on fiber samples ranging from 25 cm to 4 km, spanning short fiber segments to long-haul links. This architecture combines self-stability, broadband compatibility, and rapid acquisition, offering a practical metrology tool for both research and industry.</description>

      <title>Purcell-Like Environmental Enhancement of Classical Antennas: Self and Transfer Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental 'range boosts' in wireless links are often explained through radiation-pattern intuition, yet the underlying physics is more cleanly captured by two environment-controlled quantities: radiative damping of the radiator and \emph{channel coupling} between transmitter and receiver. Building from a dyadic-Green-function current--field formulation, we introduce an operational two-factor description of Purcell-like behavior for classical antennas. A \emph{self} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in radiative damping under an explicit excitation convention, while a \emph{transfer} factor quantifies environment-induced changes in Tx--Rx coupling. We provide measurement-aware extraction workflows (VNA $S_{11}\!\rightarrow Z_{\mathrm{in}}$ with efficiency and realized-gain accounting; link-test normalization to isolate $F_{\mathrm{tr}}$) and falsification diagnostics that prevent conflating true radiative enhancement with mismatch or added absorption. Finally, we translate self/transfer modifications into link-budget and range scalings and illustrate the framework across practical environments from VHF to mmWave, including platforms/ground planes, body proximity, field-expedient environmental radiators, terrain and passive redirection, tunnel/canyon confinement, and engineered scattering environments such as reflectarrays, metasurfaces, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS).</description>

      <title>Temporal Bragg Gratings: Broadband Reconfigurable Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces temporal Bragg gratings as a new class of broadband, reconfigurable parametric amplifiers. We present a comprehensive investigation of power amplification in these structures, where a spatially periodic refractive index profile is modulated in time at frequencies near the Bragg condition. Through systematic numerical simulations, we explore the impact of modulation location (high-index vs. low-index layers), modulation frequency relative to the Bragg frequency, and modulation amplitude on the gain spectrum and field dynamics. We demonstrate that both high-index and low-index layer modulations can produce significant parametric amplification, with high-index modulation yielding higher gain for comparable modulation depths. The amplification is frequency-agile, with gain peaks tunable across a broad spectral range, and exhibits strong asymmetry between sub-Bragg and supra-Bragg regimes, the former requires substantially stronger modulation for comparable gain. In the extreme sub-Bragg limit, the system transitions from discrete sideband amplification to a broadband gain continuum at high frequencies, explained by multi-phase-matching of parametric processes. These results provide a unified framework for designing dynamically reconfigurable optical amplifiers, tunable frequency converters, and broadband light sources using temporally modulated photonic crystals, offering new pathways toward active, agile, and integrable photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Anisotropy in Phase-Tuned Wide-Gap Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver iodide (AgI) thin films offer a compelling platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena due to their intrinsic noncentrosymmetric lattice and direct band gap. Here, we investigate the nonlinear optical properties of AgI thin films grown by physical vapor deposition that selectively produce zincblende (\zbAgI) and wurtzite (\wzAgI) phases. Using a combination of polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon photoluminescence (2PPL) spectroscopy, we identify clear phase- and morphology-dependent anisotropic nonlinear responses. Triangular \zbAgI $(111)$ flakes exhibit sixfold SHG symmetry and isotropic 2PPL emission, while rod-shaped \wzAgI $(101)$ samples display twofold-symmetric patterns in both SHG and 2PPL, which are explained by polarization analysis using second- and third- order nonlinear susceptibilities. These findings establish AgI as a promising halide semiconductor platform for phase-selective nonlinear optics and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>High-Index Semiconductor Nanoparticles as Low-Loss Alternatives to Gold for Refractive Index Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative numerical analysis of Gold (Au) and high-index semiconductor nanoparticles for refractive index sensing in the visible range. While Au nanoparticles demonstrate high sensitivity ($\approx 150$ nm per refractive index unit), their performance is constrained by ohmic losses. In contrast, high-index dielectrics are shown to exhibit comparable extinction efficiencies driven exclusively by scattering, thereby minimizing thermal losses. Multipolar decomposition reveals that semiconductors support simultaneous electric and magnetic Mie resonances, the interference of which enables directional scattering phenomena unattainable in small metallic particles. These findings suggest that high-index nanostructures offer a robust, low-loss alternative to plasmonics for advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Elastomer-based whispering gallery mode microlasers with low Young's modulus for biosensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing biological forces with microscopic lasers is an emerging technique that offers significant advantages over conventional fluorescent probes and imaging-based techniques. However, the limited availability of suitable deformable or elastic microlaser materials is restricting the scale of forces that can be detected which strongly narrows their overall applicability. Here, we describe the synthesis of spherical whispering gallery mode microbead lasers from a commercially available elastomer material in a microfluidic system with high viscosity. Upon doping with organic dye molecules, the microbeads show excellent lasing characteristics with low lasing thresholds. Measurements of the mechanical properties reveal that the lasing characteristics are directly proportional to the applied external force. The measured Young's modulus confirms that the newly synthesized microlasers are very soft and can detect higher forces than previously applied deformable microlasers made from oil droplets. Furthermore, we show that elastomer microlasers are non-toxic and stable in aqueous environments, making them ideally suited for sensing forces inside tissues and small animals.</description>

      <title>Full-bandwidth, continuous, and grayscale 3D nanolithography via line-illumination temporal focusing of ultrafast lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fast and continuous fabrication of large-scale complex 3D structures is key to unlocking industrial-scale adoption of two-photon lithography (TPL). Despite substantial improvement in peak optical patterning rates enabled by recent parallel exposure strategies, the practical fabrication rate of TPL for large structures remains low. This gap is primarily attributed to the mismatched bandwidth among toolpath generation, data transferring, and laser patterning, and the stop-and-go operation for part stitching etc. Here, we present a line-illumination temporal focusing TPL (Line-TF TPL) solution that, for the first time, demonstrates true continuous 3D nanolithography with full-bandwidth data streaming, grayscale voxel tuning, and cost-effective large-scale fabrication capability. To achieve the goal, we use a digital micromirror device (DMD) to temporally focus femtosecond laser pulses into a programmable line with enhanced 3D resolution, pixel-level grayscale control, and a high-refresh rate (&gt;10 kHz), realizing continuous fabrication at a hardware-limited maximum rate. Specifically, we fabricated centimeter-scale 3D structures with sub-diffraction features down to 75 nm laterally and 99 nm axially. Our method eliminates stitching defects by continuous scanning and grayscale stitching; and provides real-time pattern streaming at a bandwidth that is one order of magnitude higher than previous TPL systems. The line-scanning strategy also substantially lowers the pulse-energy requirement, hence the cost for parallel TPL; and maximizes the machine uptime through continuous operation, both of which are critical metrics for industrialization. Finally, we demonstrated centimeter-scale artworks, fine 3D features, and complex miniaturized optics, revealing the Line-TF TPL's large-scale application potential in photonic packaging, metamaterial discovery, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Microcomb-referenced photonic stabilization of resonant tunneling diode terahertz oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact stabilization scheme for terahertz (THz) sources by exploiting the complementary advantages of microresonator-based optical frequency combs (microcombs) and resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs). A microcomb-driven photomixing THz signal is employed as the master for injection locking of an RTD, enabling faithful transfer of the microcomb stability into the RTD. Using this approach, the free-running RTD linewidth of 50 MHz was narrowed to 165 Hz, while the single-sideband phase noise reached -80 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset with a locking range of 80 MHz. Compared with conventional electronic frequency multiplier or fiber-comb-based schemes, this method avoids high-order frequency multiplication and associated noise penalties, offering a compact and practical alternative. The dual functionality of linewidth narrowing and power scalability highlights the potential of microcomb-assisted injection locking as a route toward chip-scale, spectrally pure THz sources for beyond-5G/6G wireless communication and radar, with prospects for future extension to time-frequency metrology and precision sensing.</description>

      <title>High-Q Lithium Niobate Microring Resonator with Electro-Optically Reconfigurable Coupling Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of sophisticated integrated photonic circuits demands microresonators that combine exceptional optical confinement with dynamic operational flexibility. Here, we demonstrate a racetrack resonator on the thin-film lithium niobate platform that achieves an electro-optically tunable coupling strength while maintaining a stable, high intrinsic Q factor on the order of 10^6. By incorporating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer into the coupling region, the device facilitates a continuous and reversible transition across the entire coupling spectrum from under-coupling and critical coupling to deep over-coupling. To ensure high spectral purity, we employ Euler bends to facilitate an adiabatic transition between the straight and curved waveguide sections. This design effectively suppresses the excitation of higher-order modes, resulting in a clean transmission spectrum characterized by exclusive fundamental mode operation. At the critical coupling point, the resonator exhibits a high extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB. The integration of stable ultra-high Q, single-mode purity, and full-range coupling reconfigurability positions this device as a vital component for adaptive microwave photonics, high-efficiency nonlinear optics, and programmable quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>A polarization-Insensitive Broadband Achromatic Metalens with High Efficiency in Ultraviolet-C band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A metalens is composed of an array of artificially designed meta-atoms which can manipulate the phase, polarization and amplitude of light making it an excellent component for wavefront modulation. In this study, we design an transmittive achromatic metalens (NA equals to 0.05) composed of sapphire substrate and cross-shape silica meta-atom array operating across the entire ultraviolet C (UVC) band (200 to 280 nm) for all incident polarization through numerical simulation. It is shown that the device achieves an average focusing efficiency of 75% with a focal shift of less than 10% across the bandwidth and successfully demonstrates that is polarization-free. The device is expected to perform effectively in ultraviolet imaging and hold great potential for space-based astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed vector beam conversion via complex structured matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light, in which the amplitude, phase, and polarization of an optical field are deliberately tailored in space and time, has enabled unprecedented control over optical fields, paving the way for diverse applications across photonics and optical engineering. However, the prevailing design philosophy, which predominantly focuses on converting a single fixed input into a single desired output, relies on tunability to achieve time-division multiplexing rather than intrinsic design, and is fundamentally incompatible with wavelength-division multiplexing. Here, we propose a general framework for designing structured matter capable of achieving multiple input-output relations simultaneously, thereby enabling passive devices to realize both time-division and wavelength-division multiplexing. Using Stokes skyrmions, which have recently gained attention for their topological properties and promising applications in modern optical communication and computing, as an example, we demonstrate that a simple retarder-diattenuator-retarder cascade can be designed to simultaneously satisfy three arbitrary input-output relations, enabling diverse functionalities within a single passive element. This approach enables complex and multiplexed manipulation of topological numbers, paving the way for high-dimensional on-chip photonic computing based on optical skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-view LED displays are widely adopted in large-format applications due to their high luminance and reliability. However, visual comfort and accurate performance evaluation remain challenging due to the complex interaction between pixel luminance, human visual perception, and measurement artifacts. In this work, we introduce a novel 2D imaging luminance meter that replicates key optical parameters of the human eye, including entrance pupil size and angular resolution, to assess perceived pixel luminance. We report comprehensive measurements across various visual field angles and distances and establish a refined luminance metric that aligns with foveal vision standards (1/120 degree). Furthermore, a new method to quantify and mitigate stray light effects significantly improves measurement precision by reducing luminance overestimation from 7\% to 2\%. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing LED display design for perceptual comfort and advancing standardization in pixel luminance evaluation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Induced Transparency Bridges Disconnected Light-Harvesting Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-transfer efficiency of the natural photosynthesis system seems to be perfectly optimized during the evolution for millions of years. However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Electro-optical modulation of light polarization in a nonlocal lithium niobate metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a LiNbO3 metasurface for electro-optic modulation of light polarization in the telecommunication band. High-Q quasi-bound states in the continuum are emploied to enhance the modulation of amplitude and phase of an impinging beam by a driving electric field, leading to efficient polarization rotation and conversion. We quantified modulation effects under a CMOS-compatible bias at 1 MHz frequency, achieving a variation of 5% in the Stokes parameters and a variation of the polarization ellipse angles of about 3{\deg} for the transmitted light. These results demonstrate that dynamic polarization and phase modulation can be attained in a compact platform, highlighting the potential of high-Q resonant LiNbO3 metasurfaces for enhanced light-matter interaction in subwavelength electro-optic devices.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Topological Pumping in Photonic Waveguides Based on Global Adiabatic Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic topological pumping promises robust transport of energy and information, but its speed is fundamentally limited by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which demands prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves &gt;0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a &gt;400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms.</description>

      <title>Deformation enduring conveyance of structured light through multimode waveguides and its exploitation for flexible hair-thin endoscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable advancements in our capacity to synthesise structured light have facilitated the generation of any desired optical landscapes and even controlling the spatial distribution of light propagating through optically complex media such as multimode fibres. The availability of precisely defined structured light at the extremity of an exceedingly narrow and flexible cable holds the potential to stimulate a diverse range of highly sought-after applications, encompassing rapid communication, quantum computing, and, notably, imaging. What we lack in reaching these aspirations is the resilience of such light transport to deformations of the waveguide. Although recent theoretical investigations have delineated the attributes of ideal multimode fibres capable of deformation-enduring conveyance of structured light, tangible fibres possessing this indispensable trait to a practical extent remain elusive. Our study takes a deep dive into the precision of commercially available multimode fibres with the highest probability of demonstrating the phenomenon. We identified minuscule imperfections in their refractive index distribution, examined how these affect light transport when the fibre is deformed, and studied their implications for imaging applications. Our investigation has confirmed that these imperfections are indeed responsible for the undesirable alterations introduced into the output structured light fields during bending. Finally, as an alternative to standard graded-index fibres, manufactured by drawing silica-based preforms, we present narrow multimode waveguides in which the refractive-index profile has been established by ion exchange. These waveguides indeed exhibit previously unseen resilience of structured light transport even under severe deformation conditions and aptly fulfil the requirements of imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Fisher Information as an Operational Metric for Structured Optical Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured optical beams possess rich spatial features that are commonly characterized using entropic measures of field complexity. However, such measures do not directly quantify the operational usefulness of optical structure for parameter estimation and sensing. Here we introduce Fisher information as an operational metric to assess the metrological content of structured optical fields. By treating the measured intensity distribution as a statistical object, we define Fisher information with respect to physically relevant parameters, such as transverse displacement. We demonstrate that optical modes with comparable Shannon entropy can exhibit markedly different Fisher information, revealing sensitivity features associated with nodal structure and local curvature. Using Hermite--Gaussian modes as minimal test cases, we show that increasing modal order systematically enhances Fisher information. We then extend the analysis to two widely used families in structured light: Laguerre--Gaussian vortex beams and finite-energy Bessel--Gauss beams. Across these representative families, Fisher information provides a unified and experimentally accessible criterion for comparing structured optical fields in sensing applications.</description>

      <title>A NEAT Approach to Evolving Neural-Network-based Optimization of Chiral Photonic Metasurfaces: Application of a Neuro-Evolution Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of chiral metasurfaces with tailored optical properties remains a central challenge in nanophotonics due to the highly nonlinear relationship between geometry and chiroptical response. Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI).</description>

      <title>Low loss switchable topological photonic crystal enabled by submicron-scale patterning and phase-change of Sb2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators (PTIs) offer robust platforms for light manipulation, but reconfigurable control of their topological properties without degrading performance remains a major challenge. While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Paraxial and nonparaxial regimes of angular momentum absorption from twisted light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for the transfer of angular momentum from a Bessel wave of twisted light to a fully absorbing disk of finite radius. Exact expressions for the orbital angular momentum density and the total angular momentum transmitted to the disk are obtained for both paraxial and nonparaxial regimes. By varying the beam wavelength, polarization, and cone angle, several experimentally relevant regimes of angular momentum transfer are identified. In the extreme nonparaxial regime, the absorbed angular momentum displays a staircase-like dependence on the object size, which can be interpreted as a geometric Hall-type response of the twisted field. The results suggest potential applications for controlled angular momentum transfer and size-sensitive probing of absorbing objects.</description>

      <title>Rethinking conditioning in polarimetry: a new framework beyond $\ell^2$-based metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A standard procedure to achieve accurate, precise, and fast polarization measurement is to choose analyzing and generating polarization states that yield an $\ell^2$-condition number optimized instrument matrix. This strategy works well for rotating-waveplate systems, where the accessible polarization states trace a curve on the Poincar\'e sphere and the corresponding optimization problem is generally well posed. However, it becomes degenerate for liquid-crystal-based systems, which can generate arbitrary polarization states, and whose additional degrees of freedom allow the optimization of metrics beyond the $\ell^2$-condition number. Leveraging this unique advantage of liquid-crystal polarimeters, we introduce additional performance measures derived from alternative norms and error distributions computed via Monte Carlo simulations to inform the design of measurement schemes. We then experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in suppressing errors, paving the way for more robust and efficient polarization measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How quantum electron and nuclei motions affect biomolecular chemical reactions remains a central challengeable question at the interface of quantum chemistry and biology. Ultrafast charge migration in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has long been hypothesized to play a critical role in photochemistry, genome stability, and long-range biomolecular signaling, however, direct real-time observation of these electronic processes has remained elusive. Here, we present a theoretical investigation and propose the concept of future experimental measurements of laser-driven charge dynamics in the canonical DNA nucleobase pairs thymine_adenine and cytosine_guanine. Attosecond-resolved simulations employing high-level ab initio methods reveal base-dependent ionization mechanisms, directional charge migration pathways, and electronic coherences that govern sub-femtosecond redistribution of electron density across hydrogen-bonded nucleobase interfaces. Accordingly, we propose the concept of a quantum attosecond scanning electron microscope, termed the quantum attomicroscope (Q-attomicroscope), a capable of imaging photoinduced quantum chemistry reactions in attosecond temporal resolution and sub-nanometer spatial precision. As a proof of principle, we propose to image the charge migrations dynamics in DNA which we studied theoretically. Together, our preceptive bridges theory, instrumentation, and control, outlining a pathway toward laser mediated manipulation of DNA structure with implications for repair processes, chemical reactivity, and future personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Morphology-Preserving Holotomography: Quantitative Analysis of 3D Organoid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models for studying tissue development, disease progression, and physiological responses. Holotomography (HT) enables long-term, label-free imaging of live organoids by reconstructing volumetric refractive-index (RI) maps, but quantitative analysis is limited by the missing-cone artifact, which introduces anisotropic resolution and axial distortion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis framework that addresses the missing-cone problem at the level of image representation rather than reconstruction. We introduce morphology-preserving holotomography (MP-HT), a torus-shaped spatial filtering strategy that emphasizes high-spatial-frequency RI texture while suppressing low-frequency components most susceptible to missing-cone-induced distortion. Based on MP-HT, we develop a 3D segmentation pipeline for robust separation of epithelial and luminal structures, together with a model-based RI quantification approach that incorporates the system point spread function to enable morphology-independent estimation of dry-mass density and total dry mass. We apply the framework to long-term imaging of live hepatic organoids undergoing expansion, collapse, and fusion. The results demonstrate consistent segmentation across diverse geometries and reveal coordinated epithelial-lumen remodeling, breakdown of morphometric homeostasis during collapse, and transient biophysical fluctuations during fusion. Overall, this work establishes a physically transparent and reproducible approach for quantitative, label-free analysis of organoid dynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonadiabatic Transitions Through Engineered Ultrafast Laser Fields at Conical Intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Understanding the mechanisms of supported lipid membrane reshaping into tubular networks using quantitative DIC microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological membranes are known to form various structural motifs, from lipid bilayers to tubular filaments and networks facilitating e.g. adhesion and cell-cell communication. To understand the biophysical processes underpinning lipid-lipid interactions in these systems, synthetic membrane models are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the formation of tubular networks from supported lipid membranes of controlled lipid composition on glass. We quantify tube radii using quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) and propose a biophysical mechanism for the formation of these structures, regulated by surface tension and lipid exchange with connected supported membranes. Two lipid types are investigated, namely DOPC and DC15PC, exhibiting a liquid disordered and a solid ordered phase at room temperature, respectively. Tube formation is studied versus temperature, revealing bilamellar layers retracting and folding into tubes upon DC15PC lipids transitioning from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by lipid transfer from bilamellar to unilamellar layers. This study introduces a novel model system for bilayer tubes, allowing to elucidate the biophysics of lipid-lipid interactions governing lipid membrane reshaping into tubular structures, important for our understanding of biological membrane filaments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in coherent Ising machines (CIMs) are studied via a spectral mapping between the one-dimensional XY spin model and a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs characterized by singularities in magnetic susceptibility at critical points. These results show that CIMs do not only serve as powerful platforms for solving combinatorial optimization problems but also provide a versatile optical simulator for studying universal quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Free $\Delta$-Type Coherent Population Trapping for Microwave Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a {\Lambda}-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed {\Delta} configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching {\Delta} system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free {\Delta}-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>An integrated quantitative single-objective light-sheet microscope for subcellular dynamics in embryos and cultured multicellular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging of subcellular processes in living embryos, stem-cell systems, and organoid models requires microscopy platforms that combine high spatial resolution, fast volumetric acquisition, long-term stability, and minimal phototoxicity. Single-objective light-sheet approaches based on oblique plane microscopy (OPM) are well suited for live imaging in standard sample geometries, but most existing implementations lack the optical calibration, timing precision, and end-to-end integration required for reproducible quantitative measurements. Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts. This work establishes OPM as a robust and quantitatively calibrated single-objective light-sheet platform for transcription imaging in complex living systems.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Phase Mapping to Intensity Lobes of Structured Light via Closed-Loop Atomic Dark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model showing how the gauge-invariant loop phase in a three-level closed-loop atomic system imprints as bright-dark lobes in Laguerre Gaussian probe beam intensity patterns. In the weak probe limit, the output intensity in such systems include Beer-Lambert absorption, a scattering term and loop phase dependent interference term with optical depth controlling visibility. These systems enable mapping of arbitrary phases via interference rotation and offer a platform to measure Berry phase. Berry phase emerge as a geometric holonomy acquired by the dark states during adiabatic traversal of LG phase defined in a toroidal parameter space. Manifesting as fringe shifts which are absent in open systems, experimental realization using cold atoms or solid state platforms appears feasible, positioning structured light in closed-loop systems as ideal testbeds for geometric phases in quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify quantum geometric bounds for observables in non-Hermitian systems. We find unique bounds on non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensors, generalized two-point response correlators, conductivity tensors, and optical weights. We showcase these findings in topological systems with non-Hermitian Chern numbers. We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian geometric constraints on response functions naturally arise in open quantum systems governed by out-of-equilibrium Lindbladian dynamics. Our findings are relevant to experimental observables and responses under the realistic setups that fall beyond the idealized closed-system descriptions.</description>

      <title>Self-Image Multiplicity in a Concave Cylindrical Mirror</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concave mirrors are fundamental optical elements, yet some easily observed behaviors are rarely addressed in standard textbooks, such as the formation of multiple reflected images. Here we investigate self-imaging -- where the observer is also the observed object -- using a concave cylindrical mirror. We predict the number of self-images visible from different observation points and classify space into regions by image count. We then test these predictions with an inexpensive stainless-steel concave cylindrical mirror commonly found in teaching labs. This activity links geometrical optics principles to direct observation and provides a ready-to-use classroom demonstration and student exercise.</description>

      <title>Unified Effective Field Theory for Nonlinear and Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting phenomena that mix few-photon quantum optics with strong field nonlinear optics is hindered by the use of separate theoretical formalisms for each regime. We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield good agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Microscale selective laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles with a short-wavelength nanosecond laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

      <title>Exciton pairs coupled via the long-living phonons and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of several Wannier-Mott excitons interacting with phonons in a bulk material is considered. We show that strong exciton-phonon coupling causes the formation of a coherent two-exciton state -- the exciton pair. Unlike the biexcitons, where the photons play the role of force carrier, the exciton pair is formed via entanglement with the long-living phonon mode: (i) The essentially multi-particle theory requires excitons (cobosons composed of an electron and a hole) to satisfy the mixed Bose-Fermi statistics; (ii) This allows us to formulate a system of non-linear dynamic equations, using the multiconfiguration Hartree method applied to the Frohlich Hamiltonian. The system of equations possesses a stationary solution, which, for the case of a single exciton, describes the excitonic polaron and corresponds to the exciton pair in the two-exciton case. We also compare the fluorescent spectra of exciton polarons and exciton pairs estimated from our theory with those observed in experiments on room-temperature superfluorescence (collective emission of fluorescent light) in hybrid perovskites to give an additional insight into the superfluorescence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Stark Tuning and Charge State Control in Individual Telecom C-Band Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Telecom wavelength quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a promising solution for generating deterministic single photons compatible with existing fiber optic infrastructure. Emission in the low loss C band minimizes transmission losses, making them ideal for long distance quantum communication. In this work, we present a demonstration of both Stark tuning and charge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom C-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in an InP based n++-i-n+ heterostructure fabricated using MOVPE. The gated architecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined Stark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control over the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic states. Electrical tuning of the fine structure splitting is further demonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom wavelengths. The single photon character is confirmed via second order correlation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance with other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step toward scalable, fiber compatible quantum photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <title>Distribution of non-Gaussian states in a deployed telecommunication fiber channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical non-Gaussian states hold great promise as a pivotal resource for advanced optical quantum information processing and fault-tolerant long-distance quantum communication. Establishing their faithful transmission in a real-world communication channel, therefore, marks an important milestone. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the distribution of such non-Gaussian states in a functioning telecommunication channel that connects separate buildings within the DTU campus premises. We send photon-subtracted squeezed states, exhibiting pronounced Wigner negativity, through 300 m of deployed optical fibers to a distant building. Using quantum homodyne tomography, we fully characterize the states upon arrival. Our results show the survival of the Wigner function negativity after transmission when correcting for detection losses, indicating that the established link can potentially facilitate the violation of Bell's inequality and enable quantum steering. This achievement not only validates the practical feasibility of distributing non-Gaussian states in real-world settings, but also provides an exciting impetus towards realizing fully coherent quantum networks for high-dimensional, continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $\psi(\vec{r},t)=\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\Im(\psi^*\vec{\nabla}\psi)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}{\rho}\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?</description>
