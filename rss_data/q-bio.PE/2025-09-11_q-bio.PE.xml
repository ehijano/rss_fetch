      <title>Large deviations in non-Markovian stochastic epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for non-Markovian SIR and SIS models beyond mean field, utilizing the continuous-time random walk formalism. Using a gamma distribution for the infection and recovery inter-event times as a test case, we derive asymptotical late-time master equations with effective memory kernels and obtain analytical predictions for the final outbreak size distribution in the SIR model, and quasistationary distribution and disease lifetime in the SIS model. We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime. We also show that rescaled Markovian models fail to capture fluctuations in the non-Markovian case. Overall, our findings, confirmed against numerical simulations, demonstrate that memory strongly shapes epidemic dynamics and paves the way for extending such analyses to structured populations.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Reputation Information and Punishment in Indirect Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity promotes cooperation by allowing individuals to help others based on reputation rather than direct reciprocation. Because it relies on accurate reputation information, its effectiveness can be undermined by information gaps. We examine two forms of incomplete information: incomplete observation, in which donor actions are observed only probabilistically, and reputation fading, in which recipient reputations are sometimes classified as "Unknown". Using analytical frameworks for public assessment, we show that these seemingly similar models yield qualitatively different outcomes. Under incomplete observation, the conditions for cooperation are unchanged, because less frequent updates are exactly offset by higher reputational stakes. In contrast, reputation fading hinders cooperation, requiring higher benefit-to-cost ratios as the identification probability decreases. We then evaluate costly punishment as a third action alongside cooperation and defection. Norms incorporating punishment can sustain cooperation across broader parameter ranges without reducing efficiency in the reputation fading model. This contrasts with previous work, which found punishment ineffective under a different type of information limitation, and highlights the importance of distinguishing between types of information constraints. Finally, we review past studies to identify when punishment is effective and when it is not in indirect reciprocity.</description>

      <title>Fused Lasso Improves Accuracy of Co-occurrence Network Inference in Grouped Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments (Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in cross-environment (All) scenarios.</description>
