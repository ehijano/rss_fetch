      <title>Entanglement entropy of a color flux tube in (1+1)D Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work arxiv:2410.00112 , we computed a novel flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$) of the color flux tube stretched between a heavy quark-antiquark pair on a Euclidean lattice in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggested that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into an internal color entanglement entropy and a vibrational entropy corresponding to the transverse excitations of a QCD string, with the latter described by a thin string model. Since the color flux tube does not have transverse excitations in (1+1)D, we analytically compute the contribution of the internal color degrees of freedom to FTE$^2$ in this simpler framework. For the multipartite partitioning of the color flux tube, we find the remarkable result that FTE$^2$ only depends on the number of times the flux tube crosses the border between two spatial regions, and the dimension of the representation of the color group, but not on the string length. The result holds independently of whether the branching points are placed on the vertices of the lattice or in the center of plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Updates on the density of states method in finite temperature symplectic gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early universe have rich phenomenological implications, such as the production of a potentially detectable signal of stochastic relic background gravitational waves. The hypothesis that new, strongly coupled dynamics, hiding in a new dark sector, could be detected in this way, via the telltale signs of its confinement/deconfinement phase transition, provides a fascinating opportunity for interdisciplinary synergy between lattice field theory and astro-particle physics. But its viability relies on completing the challenging task of providing accurate theoretical predictions for the parameters characterising the strongly coupled theory. Density of states methods, and in particular the linear logarithmic relaxation (LLR) method, can be used to address the intrinsic numerical difficulties that arise due the meta-stable dynamics in the vicinity of the critical point. For example, it allows one to obtain accurate determinations of thermodynamic observables that are otherwise inaccessible, such as the free energy. In this contribution, we present an update on results of the analysis of the finite temperature deconfinement phase transition in a pure gauge theory with a symplectic gauge group, $Sp(4)$, by using the LLR method. We present a first analysis of the properties of the transition in the thermodynamic limit, and provide a road map for future work, including a brief preliminary discussion that will inform future publications.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2 + 1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic stabilizer states. We propose a protocol for their experimental preparation, presenting an opportunity to demonstrate a quantum over classical advantage via simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of a strongly coupled system. Our results also highlight the importance of magic for gauge theory thermalization, revealing a connection between computational complexity and quantum ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD with small baryon chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our measurement of the equation of state of isospin asymmetric QCD to small baryon and strangeness chemical potentials, using the leading order Taylor expansion coefficients computed directly at non-zero isospin chemical potentials. Extrapolating the fully connected contributions to vanishing pion sources is particularly challenging, which we overcome by using information from isospin chemical potential derivatives evaluated numerically. Using the Taylor coefficients, we present, amongst others, first results for the equation of state along the electric charge chemical potential axis, which is potentially of relevance for the evolution of the early Universe at large lepton flavour asymmetries.</description>

      <title>A universal framework for the quantum simulation of Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a universal framework for the quantum simulation of SU(N) Yang-Mills theories on fault-tolerant digital quantum computers adopting the orbifold lattice formulation. As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang-Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut-Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being closely connected to the origin of the nucleon mass, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon have attracted significant attention in recent years. We present the first model-independent precise determinations of the gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon at the physical pion mass, using a data-driven dispersive approach. The so-called ``last unknown global property'' of the nucleon, the $D$-term, is determined to be $-\left(3.38^{+0.26}_{-0.32}\right)$. The root mean square radius of the mass distribution inside the nucleon is determined to be $0.97^{+0.02}_{-0.03}~\text{fm}$. Notably, this value is larger than the proton charge radius, suggesting a modern structural view of the nucleon where gluons, responsible for most of the nucleon mass, are distributed over a larger spatial region than quarks, which dominate the charge distribution. We also predict the nucleon angular momentum and mechanical radii, providing further insights into the intricate internal structure of the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Dyson Brownian motion and random matrix dynamics of weight matrices during learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During training, weight matrices in machine learning architectures are updated using stochastic gradient descent or variations thereof. In this contribution we employ concepts of random matrix theory to analyse the resulting stochastic matrix dynamics. We first demonstrate that the dynamics can generically be described using Dyson Brownian motion, leading to e.g. eigenvalue repulsion. The level of stochasticity is shown to depend on the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, explaining the empirically observed linear scaling rule. We verify this linear scaling in the restricted Boltzmann machine. Subsequently we study weight matrix dynamics in transformers (a nano-GPT), following the evolution from a Marchenko-Pastur distribution for eigenvalues at initialisation to a combination with additional structure at the end of learning.</description>

      <title>The gradient flow at higher orders in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various results for higher-order perturbative calculations in the gradient-flow formalism are reviewed, including the gradient-flow beta function and the small-flow-time expansion of the hadronic vacuum polarization and the energy-momentum tensor. In addition, the strategy of regions is outlined in order to obtain systematic expansions of gradient-flow integrals, for example at large and small flow times.</description>
