      <title>The zero entropy locus for the Lozi maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero entropy locus for the Lozi maps. We first define a region $R$ in the parameter space and prove that for the parameters in $R$, the Lozi maps have the topological entropy zero. $R$ is contained in a larger region where every Lozi map has a unique period-two orbit, and that orbit is attracting. It is easy to see that the zero entropy locus cannot coincide with that larger region since it contains parameters for which the fixed point of the corresponding Lozi map has homoclinic points.</description>

      <title>Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison.
  The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.
  This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.</description>

      <title>Singular bifurcations in a slow-fast modified Leslie-Gower model with Holling type II functional response, weak Allee effect and a generalist predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a predator-prey system with a generalist Leslie-Gower predator, a functional Holling type II response, and a weak Allee effect on the prey. The prey's population often grows much faster than its predator, allowing us to introduce a small time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ that relates the growth rates of both species, giving rise to a slow-fast system. Zhu and Liu (2022) show that, in the case of the weak Allee effect, Hopf singular bifurcation, slow-fast canard cycles, relaxation oscillations, etc., exist. Our main contribution lies in the rigorous analysis of a degenerate scenario organized by a (degenerate) transcritical bifurcation. The key tool employed is the blow-up method that desingularizes the degenerate singularity. In addition, we determine the criticality of the singular Hopf bifurcation using recent intrinsic techniques that do not require a local normal form. The theoretical analysis is complemented by a numerical bifurcation analysis, in which we numerically identify and analytically confirm the existence of a nearby Takens-Bogdanov point.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the largest digit for parabolic Iterated Function Systems of the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the largest digit for a wide class of infinite parabolic Iterated Function Systems (IFSs) of the unit interval. Due to the recurrence to parabolic (neutral) fixed points, the dimension analysis of these systems become more delicate than that of uniformly contracting IFSs. We show that the Hausdorff dimensions of level sets associated with the largest digits are constantly equal to the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of the IFS. This result is an analogue of Wu and Xu's theorem [Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. {\bf 146} (2009), 207--212] on the regular continued fraction. Examples of application of our result include the backward (aka minus, or negative) continued fractions, even integer continued fractions, and go beyond. Our main technical tool is a dimension theory for non-uniformly expanding Markov interval maps with infinitely many branches.</description>

      <title>Entropy formula of folding type for $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, Ruelle derived explicit formulae for entropy production of smooth dynamical systems. The vanishing or strictly positivity of entropy production is determined by the entropy formula of folding type \[h_{\mu}(f)= F_{\mu}(f)-\displaystyle\int\sum\nolimits_{\lambda_i(f, x)&lt;0} \lambda_i(f, x)d\mu(x), \] which relates the metric entropy, folding entropy and negative Lyapunov exponents. This paper establishes the formula for all $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps, including those with degeneracy. More specifically, the entropy formula of folding type holds if and, under a condition on the Jacobian of the map, only if $\mu$ has absolutely continuous conditional measures on the stable manifolds. To overcome the degeneracy, the Pesin Theory for general $C^{1+\alpha}$ maps is developed.</description>

      <title>Linearizations of periodic point free distal homeomorphisms on the annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{A}$ be an annulus in the plane $\mathbb R^2$ and $g:\mathbb{A}\rightarrow \mathbb{A}$ be a boundary components preserving homeomorphism which is distal and has no periodic points. In \cite{SXY}, the authors show that there is a continuous decomposition $\mathcal P$ of $\mathbb{A}$ into $g$-invariant circles such that all the restrictions of $g$ on them share a common irrational rotation number (also called the rotation number of $g$) and all these circles are linearly ordered by the inclusion relation on the sets of bounded components of their complements in $\mathbb R^2$. In this note, we show that if the decomposition $\mathcal P$ above has a continuous section, then $g$ can be linearized, that is it is topologically conjugate to a rigid rotation on $\mathbb{A}$. For every irrational number $\alpha\in (0, 1)$, we show the existence of such a distal homeomorphism $g$ on $\mathbb{A}$ that it cannot be linearized and its rotation number is $\alpha$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate homogeneous $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of regulatory network dynamics: equilibria and saddle-node bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a combined combinatorial/numerical approach to studying equilibria and bifurcations in network models arising in Systems Biology. ODE models of the dynamics suffer from high dimensional parameters which presents a significant obstruction to studying the global dynamics via numerical methods. The main point of this paper is to demonstrate that adapting and combining classical techniques with recently developed combinatorial methods provides a richer picture of the global dynamics despite the high parameter dimension.
  Given a network topology describing state variables which regulate one another via monotone and bounded functions, we first use the {\em Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks} (DSGRN) software to obtain a combinatorial summary of the dynamics. This summary is coarse but global and we use this information as a first pass to identify ``interesting'' subsets of parameters in which to focus. We construct an associated ODE model with high parameter dimension using our {\em Network Dynamics Modeling and Analysis} (NDMA) Python library. We introduce algorithms for efficiently investigating the dynamics in these ODE models restricted to these parameter subsets. Finally, we perform a statistical validation of the method and several interesting dynamical applications including finding saddle-node bifurcations in a $54$ parameter model.</description>

Abstract: We obtain expansions of ergodic integrals for $\Z^d$-covers of compact self-similar translation flows, and as a consequence we obtain a form of weak rational ergodicity with optimal rates. As examples, we consider the so-called self-similar $(s,1)$-staircase flows ($\Z$-extensions of self-similar translations flows of genus-$2$ surfaces), and particular cases of the Ehrenfest wind-tree model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topological recurrence phenomenon of actions of locally compact abelian groups on compact metric spaces. In the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions we develop new techniques to analyze Bohr recurrence sets. These techniques include finding and manipulating correlations between the coordinates of the set of recurrence. Using this, we show that Bohr recurrence sets are recurrence sets for $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Weyl systems. This family encompasses, for example, all $\mathbb{Z}^d$-affine nilsystems. To our knowledge, this is the first result towards a positive answer to Katznelson question in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-actions.</description>

Abstract: Vaccination is widely recognised as one of the most effective forms of public health interventions. Individuals decisions regarding vaccination creates a complex social dilemma between individual and collective interests, where each person's decision affects the overall public health outcome. In this paper, we study the adaptive dynamics for the evolutionary dynamics of strategies in a fundamental game-theoretic model of vaticination. We show the existence of an (Nash) equilibrium and analyse the stability and bifurcations when varying the relevant parameters. We also demonstrate our analytical results by several concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of dynamical systems driven by Poisson random measures with periodic sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a nonlinear system governed by an ordinary differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small jump noise of size $\varepsilon, 0&lt; \varepsilon,\delta \ll 1.$ The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends not only on its current value but on the most recent measurement of the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0,$ the stochastic process of interest converges, in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Next, the study of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters $\varepsilon, \delta$ in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the rescaled process converges, in a strong (path-wise) sense, to an effective process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise effect. Consequently, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with error bounds on the remainder.</description>

      <title>Periodic colorings and orientations in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) poses a major public health challenge, with it being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide as of 2024. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC comprise $15\%$ of all CRC and have shown remarkable response to immunotherapy, especially with PD-1 inhibitors. Mathematical models are a promising avenue for treatment optimisation, and we use delay integro-differential equations to model the interactions and dynamics of various cell types, immune checkpoints, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and cytokines. We note that many of these species are being modelled deterministically for the first time in cancer, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the complex underlying immune dynamics. We consider two compartments: the tumour site and the tumour-draining lymph node (TDLN), taking into account phenomena such as DC migration, T cell proliferation, acquired resistance to pembrolizumab, and CD8+ T cell exhaustion and reinvigoration. The parameter values and initial conditions for the model are estimated from experimental data, incorporating various pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing data from the TCGA COADREAD database. We finally optimise CRC treatment with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab $\unicode{x2014}$ one of the most used PD-1 inhibitors. We maximise treatment efficacy and efficiency in locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients whilst accounting for toxicity, and improve upon currently FDA-approved therapeutic regimens for metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC. We demonstrate that a single medium-to-high dose of pembrolizumab is sufficient for effective tumour eradication, whilst being efficient, safe and practical.</description>
