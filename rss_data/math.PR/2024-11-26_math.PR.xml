      <title>The reference interval in higher-order stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volterra Equations for Local Times of Spectrally Positive Levy Processes with Gaussian Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following our previous work [68], this paper continues to investigate the evolution dynamics of local times of spectrally positive Levy processes with Gaussian components in the spatial direction. We first prove that conditioned on the finiteness of the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a given value, local times at positive line are equal in law to the unique solution of a stochastic Volterra equation driven by a Gaussian white noise and two Poisson random measures with convolution kernel given in terms of the scale function. The existence and uniqueness of strong solution of the stochastic Volterra equation are also proved when the Levy measure has finite first moment. We then provide several equivalent representations and propose a flow in the local times by establishing a comparison principle for local times of Levy processes with various drifts or stopped when local times at zero exceed different given values.
  Armed with the stochastic Volterra equation, we also provide some properties of local times, including the uniform moment estimates, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-Holder continuity and maximal inequality. By using the method of duality, we establish an exponential-affine representation of the Laplace functional in terms of the unique non-negative solution of a nonlinear Volterra equation associated with the Laplace exponent of the Levy process. This gives us another perspective on the evolution dynamics of local times in the spatial direction.</description>

      <title>Strassen's local law of the iterated logarithm for the generalized fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X:=\{X(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ be a generalized fractional Brownian motion: $$
  \{X(t)\}_{t\ge0}\overset{d}{=}\left\{ \int_{\mathbb R} \left((t-u)_+^{\alpha}-(-u)_+^{\alpha} \right) |u|^{-\gamma/2} B(du) \right\}_{t\ge0}, $$ with parameters $\gamma \in (0, 1)$ and $\alpha\in \left(-1/2+ \gamma/2, \, 1/2+ \gamma/2 \right)$. This is a self-similar Gaussian process introduced by Pang and Taqqu (2019) as the scaling limit of power-law shot noise processes. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ determine the probabilistic and statistical properties of $X$. In particular, the parameter $\gamma$ introduces non-stationarity of the increments. In this paper, we prove Strassen's local law of the iterated logarithm of $X$ at any fixed point $t_0 \in (0, \infty)$, which describes explicitly the roles played by the parameters $\alpha, \gamma$ and the location $t_0$. Our result is different from the previous Strassen's LIL for $X$ at infinity proved by Ichiba, Pang and Taqqu (2022).</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence Rates for Empirical Measures of Random Subsequence of $\{n\alpha\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an irrational number $\alpha$. Let $X_1,X_2,\cdots$ be independent, identically distributed, integer-valued random variables with characteristic function $\varphi$, and let $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ be the partial sums. Consider the random walk $\{S_n \alpha\}_{n\ge 1}$ on the torus, where $\{\cdot\}$ denotes the fractional part. We study the long time asymptotic behaviour of the empirical measure of this random walk to the uniform distribution under the general $p$-Wasserstein distance. Our results show that the Wasserstein convergence rate depends on the Diophantine properties of $\alpha$ and the H\"older continuity of the characteristic function $\varphi$ at the origin, and there is an interesting critical phenomenon that will occur. The proof is based on the PDE approach developed by L. Ambrosio, F. Stra and D. Trevisan in [2] and the continued fraction representation of the irrational number $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Deformations of biorthogonal ensembles and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large class of deformations of continuous and discrete biorthogonal ensembles and investigate their behavior in the limit of a large number of particles. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that if a biorthogonal ensemble converges to a (universal) limiting process, then the deformed biorthogonal ensemble converges to a deformed version of the same limiting process. To construct the deformed version of the limiting process, we rely on a procedure of marking and conditioning. Our approach is based on an analysis of the probability generating functionals of the ensembles and is conceptually different from the traditional approach via correlation kernels. Thanks to this method, our sufficient conditions are rather mild and do not rely on much regularity of the original ensemble and of the deformation. As a consequence of our results, we obtain probabilistic interpretations of several Painlev\'e-type kernels that have been constructed in the literature, as deformations of classical sine and Airy point processes.</description>

      <title>Stable Approximation for Call Function Via Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S_{n}$ be a sum of independent identically distribution random variables with finite first moment and $h_{M}$ be a call function defined by $g_{M}(x)=\max\{x-M,0\}$ for $x\in\mathbb{R}$, $M&gt;0$. In this paper, we assume the random variables are in the domain $\mathcal{R}_{\alpha}$ of normal attraction of a stable law of exponent $\alpha$, then for $\alpha\in(1,2)$, we use the Stein's method developed in \cite{CNX21} to give uniform and non uniform bounds on $\alpha$-stable approximation for the call function without additional moment assumptions. These results will make the approximation theory of call function applicable to the lower moment conditions, and greatly expand the scope of application of call function in many fields.</description>

      <title>A gradient model for the Bernstein polynomial basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a symmetric, gradient exclusion process, in the class of non-cooperative kinetically constrained lattice gases, modelling a non-linear diffusivity where mass transport is constrained by the local density not being too small or too large. Maintaining the gradient property is the main technical challenge. The resulting model enjoys of properties in common with the Bernstein polynomial basis, and is associated with the diffusion coefficient $D_{n,k}(\rho)=\binom{n+k}{k}\rho^n(1-\rho)^k$, for $n,k$ arbitrary natural numbers. The dynamics generalizes the Porous Media Model, and we show, via the entropy method, the hydrodynamic limit for the empirical measure associated with a perturbed, irreducible version of the process. The hydrodynamic equation is proved to be a Generalized Porous Media Equation.</description>

Abstract: Radial BPZ equations come naturally when one solves Dub\'{e}dat's commutation relation in the radial setting. We construct positive solutions to radial BPZ equations and show that partition functions of FK-Ising interfaces in a polygon conditional on a one-arm event are positive solutions to radial BPZ equations.</description>

      <title>Gaussian deconvolution on $\mathbb R^d$ with application to self-repellent Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the convolution equation $(\delta - J) * G = g$ on $\mathbb R^d$, $d&gt;2$, where $\delta$ is the Dirac delta function and $J,g$ are given functions. We provide conditions on $J, g$ that ensure the deconvolution $G(x)$ to decay as $( x \cdot \Sigma^{-1} x)^{-(d-2)/2}$ for large $|x|$, where $\Sigma$ is a positive-definite diagonal matrix. This extends a recent deconvolution theorem on $\mathbb Z^d$ proved by the author and Slade to the possibly anisotropic, continuum setting while maintaining its simplicity. Our motivation comes from studies of statistical mechanical models on $\mathbb R^d$ based on the lace expansion. As an example, we apply our theorem to a self-repellent Brownian motion in dimensions $d&gt;4$, proving its critical two-point function to decay as $|x|^{-(d-2)}$, like the Green function of the Laplace operator $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>A Kaczmarz-Inspired Method for Orthogonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper asks if it is possible to orthogonalize a set of $n$ linearly independent unit vectors in $n$ dimensions by only considering random pairs of vectors at a time. In particular, at each step one accesses a random pair of vectors and can replace them with some different basis for their span. If one could instead deterministically decide which pair of vectors to access, one could run the Gram-Schmidt procedure. In our setting, however, the pair is selected at random, so the answer is less clear.
  We provide a positive answer to the question: given a pair of vectors at each iteration, replace one with its component perpendicular to the other, renormalized. This produces a sequence that almost surely converges to an orthonormal set. Quantitatively, we can measure the rate convergence in terms of the condition number $\kappa(A)$ of the square matrix $A$ formed by taking the $n$ vectors to be its columns. When the condition number is initially very large, we prove a rapidly decreasing upper bound on the expected logarithm of the condition number after $t$ iterations. The bound initially decreases by $O(1/n^2)$ each iteration, but the decrease tapers off as the condition number improves. We then show $O(n^4/\delta\varepsilon^2+n^3\log(\kappa(A))\log\log(\kappa(A)))$ iterations suffice to bring the condition number below $1+\varepsilon$ with probability $1-\delta$.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative Stein's Method: Applications to Free Probability and Sums of Non-commutative Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a straightforward formulation of Stein's method for the semicircular distribution, specifically designed for the analysis of non-commutative random variables. Our approach employs a non-commutative version of Stein's heuristic, interpolating between the target and approximating distributions via the free Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. A key application of this work is to provide a new perspective for obtaining precise estimates of accuracy in the semicircular approximation for sums of weakly dependent variables, measured under the total variation metric. We leverage the simplicity of our arguments to achieve robust convergence results, including: (i) A Berry-Esseen theorem under the total variation distance and (ii) Enhancements in rates of decay under the non-commutative Wasserstein distance towards the semicircular distribution, given adequate high-order moment matching conditions.</description>

      <title>Connections between sequential Bayesian inference and evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Cover Time of Tori in Dimensions $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider large deviations of the cover time of the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^d$, $d \geq 3$ by simple random walk. We prove a lower bound on the probability that the cover time is smaller than $\gamma\in (0,1)$ times its expected value, with exponents matching the upper bound from [Goodman-den Hollander, Probab. Theory Related Fields (2014)] and [Comets-Gallesco-Popov-Vachkovskaia, Electron. J. Probab. (2013)]. Moreover, we derive sharp asymptotics for $\gamma \in (\frac{d+2}{2d},1)$. The strong coupling of the random walk on the torus and random interlacements developed in a recent work [Pr\'evost-Rodriguez-Sousi, arXiv:2309.03192] serves as an important ingredient in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Interface scaling limit for the critical planar Ising model perturbed by a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the interface separating $+1$ and $-1$ spins in the critical planar Ising model with Dobrushin boundary conditions perturbed by an external magnetic field has a scaling limit. This result holds when the Ising model is defined on a bounded and simply connected subgraph of $\delta \mathbb{Z}^2$, with $\delta &gt;0$. We show that if the scaling of the external field is of order $\delta^{15/8}$, then, as $\delta \to 0$, the interface converges in law to a random curve whose law is conformally covariant and absolutely continuous with respect to SLE$_3$. This limiting law is a massive version of SLE$_3$ in the sense of Makarov and Smirnov and we give an explicit expression for its Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to SLE$_3$. We also prove that if the scaling of the external field is of order $\delta^{15/8}g_1(\delta)$ with $g_1(\delta)\to 0$, then the interface converges in law to SLE$_3$. In contrast, we show that if the scaling of the external field is of order $\delta^{15/8}g_2(\delta)$ with $g_2(\delta) \to \infty$, then the interface degenerates to a boundary arc.</description>

      <title>Generating social networks with static and dynamic utility-maximization approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a conceptual framework that model human social networks as an undirected dot-product graph of independent individuals. Their relationships are only determined by a cost-benefit analysis, i.e. by maximizing an objective function at the scale of the individual or of the whole network. On this framework, we build a new artificial network generator in two versions. The first fits within the tradition of artificial network generators by being able to generate similar networks from empirical data. The second relaxes the computational efficiency constraint and implements the same micro-based decision algorithm, but in agent-based simulations with time and fully independent agents. This latter version enables social scientists to perform an in-depth analysis of the consequences of behavioral constraints affecting individuals on the network they form. This point is illustrated by a case study of imperfect information.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff measure of the boundary of the Brownian disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16541v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the boundary $\partial \mathbb D$ of the Brownian disk $\mathbb D$ as a metric space by endowing it with the (restriction of the) metric of $\mathbb D$. We show that the uniform measure on $\partial \mathbb D$ coincides with the Hausdorff measure associated with the gauge function $h(s)=\kappa s^2\log\log(1/s)$ for some deterministic constant $\kappa&gt;0$. We also state the analogous result for the boundary of the Brownian half-plane $\mathbb H$. This proves in particular that the uniform measure on the boundary of the Brownian disk (resp. the Brownian half-plane) is determined by the metric on $\mathbb D$ (resp. on $\mathbb H$).</description>

      <title>Optimal decay of eigenvector overlap for non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the standard overlap $\mathcal{O}_{ij}: =\langle \mathbf{r}_j, \mathbf{r}_i\rangle\langle \mathbf{l}_j, \mathbf{l}_i\rangle$ of any bi-orthogonal family of left and right eigenvectors of a large random matrix $X$ with centred i.i.d. entries and we prove that it decays as an inverse second power of the distance between the corresponding eigenvalues. This extends similar results for the complex Gaussian ensemble from Bourgade and Dubach [arXiv:1801.01219], as well as Benaych-Georges and Zeitouni [arXiv:1806.06806], to any i.i.d. matrix ensemble in both symmetry classes. As a main tool, we prove a two-resolvent local law for the Hermitisation of $X$ uniformly in the spectrum with optimal decay rate and optimal dependence on the density near the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>The stochastic evolution of an infinite population with logistic-type interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite population of point entities dwelling in the habitat $X=\mathds{R}^d$ is studied. Its members arrive at and depart from $X$ at random. The departure rate has a term corresponding to a logistic-type interaction between the entities. Thereby, the corresponding Kolmogorov operator $L$ has an additive quadratic part, which usually produces essential difficulties in its study. The population's pure states are locally finite counting measures defined on $X$. The set of such states $\Gamma$ is equipped with the vague topology and thus with the corresponding Borel $\sigma$-field. The population evolution is described at two levels. At the first level, we deal with the Fokker-Planck equation for $(L,\mathcal{F},\mu_0)$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is an appropriate set of bounded test functions $F:\Gamma\to \mathds{R}$ (domain of $L$) and $\mu_0$ is an initial state, which is supposed to belong to the set $\mathcal{P}_{\rm exp}$ of sub-Poissonian probability measures on $\Gamma$. We prove that the Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution $t\mapsto\mu_t$ which also belongs to $\mathcal{P}_{\rm exp}$. Some of the properties of this solution are also obtained. The second level description yields a Markov process such that its one dimensional marginals coincide with the mentioned states $\mu_t$. The process is obtained as the unique solution of the corresponding martingale problem.</description>

Abstract: We consider the simultaneous optimal transportation of measures, where the target marginal is not necessarily fixed. For this problem, we prove the existence of a solution for completely regular spaces and investigate the structure of the discrete problem. We establish a connection between the Monge problem and the Kantorovich problem by showing that their functionals are equal and that the solutions coincide in Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Approximability of Poisson structures for the 4-vertex model, and the higher-spin XXX chain, and Yang-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement the quantum inverse scattering method for the 4-vertex model. In comparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics, ranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to algebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed plane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for the 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for L-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the transfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators that can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain in the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering methods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study integrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the 4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite volume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From explicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude by discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is closely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for approximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of computations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to L-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of another Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.</description>

      <title>Interval-Valued Fuzzy Fault Tree Analysis through Qualitative Data Processing and its Applications in Marine Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marine accidents highlight the crucial need for human safety. They result in loss of life, environmental harm, and significant economic costs, emphasizing the importance of being proactive and taking precautionary steps. This study aims to identify the root causes of accidents, to develop effective strategies for preventing them. Due to the lack of accurate quantitative data or reliable probability information, we employ qualitative approaches to assess the reliability of complex systems. We collect expert judgments regarding the failure likelihood of each basic event and aggregate those opinions using the Similarity-based Aggregation Method (SAM) to form a collective assessment. In SAM, we convert expert opinions into failure probability using interval-valued triangular fuzzy numbers. Since each expert possesses different knowledge and various levels of experience, we need to assign weights to their opinions to reflect their relative expertise. We employ the Best-Worst Method (BWM) to calculate the weights of each criterion, and then use the weighting scores to determine the weights of each expert. Ranking of basic events according to their criticality is a crucial step, and in this study, we use the FVI measure to prioritize and rank these events according to their criticality level. To demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our proposed methodology, we apply our method to two case studies: (1) chemical cargo contamination, and (2) the loss of ship steering ability. These case studies serve as examples to illustrate the practicality and utility of our approach in evaluating criticality and assessing risk in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Proportional infinite-width infinite-depth limit for deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distributional properties of linear neural networks with random parameters in the context of large networks, where the number of layers diverges in proportion to the number of neurons per layer. Prior works have shown that in the infinite-width regime, where the number of neurons per layer grows to infinity while the depth remains fixed, neural networks converge to a Gaussian process, known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process. However, this Gaussian limit sacrifices descriptive power, as it lacks the ability to learn dependent features and produce output correlations that reflect observed labels. Motivated by these limitations, we explore the joint proportional limit in which both depth and width diverge but maintain a constant ratio, yielding a non-Gaussian distribution that retains correlations between outputs. Our contribution extends previous works by rigorously characterizing, for linear activation functions, the limiting distribution as a nontrivial mixture of Gaussians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any weakly interacting particle system with bounded kernel, we give uniform-in-time estimates of the $L^2$ norm of correlation functions, provided that the diffusion coefficient is large enough. When the condition on the kernels is more restrictive, we can remove the dependence of the lower bound for diffusion coefficient on the initial data and estimate the size of chaos in a weaker sense. Based on these estimates, we may study fluctuation around the mean-field limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work derives extremal tail bounds for the Gaussian trace estimator applied to a real symmetric matrix. We define a partial ordering on the eigenvalues, so that when a matrix has greater spectrum under this ordering, its estimator will have worse tail bounds. This is done for two families of matrices: positive semidefinite matrices with bounded effective rank, and indefinite matrices with bounded 2-norm and fixed Frobenius norm. In each case, the tail region is defined rigorously and is constant for a given family.</description>

      <title>Canonical Correlation Analysis: review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a century canonical correlations, variables, and related concepts have been studied across various fields, with contributions dating back to Jordan [1875] and Hotelling [1936]. This text surveys the evolution of canonical correlation analysis, a fundamental statistical tool, beginning with its foundational theorems and progressing to recent developments and open research problems. Along the way we introduce and review methods, notions, and fundamental concepts from linear algebra, random matrix theory, and high-dimensional statistics, placing particular emphasis on rigorous mathematical treatment.
  The survey is intended for technically proficient graduate students and other researchers with an interest in this area. The content is organized into five chapters, supplemented by six sets of exercises found in Chapter 6. These exercises introduce additional material, reinforce key concepts, and serve to bridge ideas across chapters. We recommend the following sequence: first, solve Problem Set 0, then proceed with Chapter 1, solve Problem Set 1, and so on through the text.</description>

Abstract: We calculate and analyze various entropy measures and their properties for selected probability distributions. The entropies considered include Shannon, R\'enyi, generalized R\'enyi, Tsallis, Sharma-Mittal, and modified Shannon entropy, along with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These measures are examined for several distributions, including gamma, chi-squared, exponential, Laplace, and log-normal distributions. We investigate the dependence of the entropy on the parameters of the respective distribution. We also study the convergence of Shannon entropy for certain probability distributions. Furthermore, we identify the extreme values of Shannon entropy for Gaussian vectors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Detecting practically significant dependencies in infinite dimensional data via distance correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we take a different look on the problem of testing the independence of two infinite dimensional random variables using the distance correlation. Instead of testing if the distance correlation vanishes exactly, we are interested in the null hypothesis that it does not exceed a certain threshold. Our formulation of the testing problem is motivated by the observation that in many cases it is more reasonable to test for a practically significant dependency since it is rare that a null hypothesis of perfect independence is exactly satisfied. This point of view also reflects statistical practice, where one often classifies the strength of the association in categories such as 'small', 'medium' and 'large' and the precise definitions depend on the specific application.
  To address these problems we develop a pivotal test for the hypothesis that the distance correlation $\mathrm{dcor}(X,Y)$ between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ does not exceed a pre-specified threshold $\Delta$, that is $H_0 : \mathrm{dcor}(X,Y) \leq \Delta$ versus $H_1 : \mathrm{dcor}(X,Y) &gt; \Delta$. We also determine a minimum value $\hat \Delta_\alpha$ from the data such that $H_0$ is rejected for all $\Delta \leq \hat \Delta_\alpha$ at controlled type I error $\alpha$. This quantity can be interpreted as a measure of evidence against the hypothesis of independence.
  The new test is applicable to data modeled by a strictly stationary and absolutely regular process with components taking values in separable metric spaces of negative type, which includes Euclidean as well as functional data. Our approach is based on a new functional limit theorem for the sequential distance correlation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a priori bounds for the dynamic fractional $\Phi^4$ model on $\mathbb{T}^3$ in the full subcritical regime using the framework of Hairer's regularity structures theory. Assuming the model bounds our estimates imply global existence of solutions and existence of an invariant measure. We extend the method developed for the usual heat operator by Chandra, Moinat and Weber [CMW23] to the fractional heat operator, thereby treating a more physically relevant model. A key ingredient in this work is the development of localised multilevel Schauder estimates for the fractional heat operator which is not covered by Hairer's original work. Furthermore, the algebraic arguments from [CMW23] are streamlined significantly.</description>

Abstract: In work with a variety of co-authors, Staver and Levin have argued that savanna and forest coexist as alternative stable states with discontinuous changes in density of trees at the boundary. Here we formulate a nonhomogeneous spatial model of the competition between forest and savanna. We prove that coexistence occurs for a time that is exponential in the size of the system, and that after an initial transient, boundaries between the alternative equilibria remain stable. This result is valid in general for systems that exhibit bistability in a homogeneous environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the large deviations from the hydrodynamic limit of the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP). This problem was studied in Jensen (2000) and Varadhan (2004) and was shown to be related to entropy production in the inviscid Burgers equation. Here we prove the full large deviation principle. Our method relies on the explicit formula of Matetski, Quastel, and Remenik (2016) for the transition probabilities of the TASEP.</description>

      <title>A cross-border market model with limited transmission capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a cross-border market model for two countries based on a continuous trading mechanism, in which the transmission capacities that enable transactions between market participants from different countries are limited. Our market model can be described by a regime-switching process alternating between active and inactive regimes, in which cross-border trading is possible respectively prohibited. Starting from a reduced-form representation of the two national limit order books, we derive a high-frequency approximation of the microscopic model, assuming that the size of an individual order converges to zero while the order arrival rate tends to infinity. If transmission capacities are available, the limiting dynamics are as follows: the queue size processes at the top of the two limit order books follow a four-dimensional linear Brownian motion in the positive orthant with oblique reflection at the axes. Each time the two best ask queues or the two best bid queues simultaneously hit zero, the queue size process is reinitialized. The capacity process can be described as a linear combination of local times and is hence of finite variation. The analytic tractability of the limiting dynamics allows us to compute key quantities of interest.</description>

      <title>High moments of the SHE in the clustering regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the high moments of the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE) via a transformation to the attractive Brownian Particles (BPs), which are Brownian motions interacting via pairwise attractive drift. In those scaling regimes where the particles tend to cluster, we prove a Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for the empirical measure of the attractive BPs. Under what we call the 1-to-$n$ initial-terminal condition, we characterize the unique minimizer of the rate function and relate the minimizer to the spacetime limit shapes of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation in the upper tails. The results of this paper are used in the companion paper Lin and Tsai (2023) to prove an $n$-point, upper-tail LDP for the KPZ equation and to characterize the corresponding spacetime limit shape.</description>

      <title>Modeling Information Flow with a Multi-Stage Queuing Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear stochastic model to describe the propagation of information inside a computer processor. In this model, a computational task is divided into stages, and information can flow from one stage to another. The model is formulated as a spatially-extended, continuous-time Markov chain where space represents different stages. This model is equivalent to a spatially-extended version of the M/M/s queue. The main modeling feature is the throttling function which describes the processor slowdown when the amount of information falls below a certain threshold. We derive the stationary distribution for this stochastic model and develop a closure for a deterministic ODE system that approximates the evolution of the mean and variance of the stochastic model. We demonstrate the validity of the closure with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-Parameter Approximations of Sums of Locally Dependent Random Variables via Stein's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{X_{i}, i\in J\}$ be a family of locally dependent non-negative integer-valued random variables with finite expectations and variances. We consider the sum $W=\sum_{i\in J}X_i$ and use Stein's method to establish general upper error bounds for the total variation distance $d_{TV}(W, M)$, where $M$ represents a three-parameter random variable. As a direct consequence, we obtain a discretized normal approximation for $W$. As applications, we study in detail four well-known examples, which are counting vertices of all edges point inward, birthday problem, counting monochromatic edges in uniformly colored graphs, and triangles in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph. Through delicate analysis and computations, we obtain sharper upper error bounds than existing results.</description>

      <title>Stationary measures of continuous time Markov chains with applications to stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study continuous-time Markov chains on the non-negative integers under mild regularity conditions (in particular, the set of jump vectors is finite and both forward and backward jumps are possible). Based on the so-called flux balance equation, we derive an iterative formula for calculating stationary measures. Specifically, a stationary measure $\pi(x)$ evaluated at $x\in\N_0$ is represented as a linear combination of a few generating terms, similarly to the characterization of a stationary measure of a birth-death process, where there is only one generating term, $\pi(0)$. The coefficients of the linear combination are recursively determined in terms of the transition rates of the Markov chain. For the class of Markov chains we consider, there is always at least one stationary measure (up to a scaling constant). We give various results pertaining to uniqueness and non-uniqueness of stationary measures, and show that the dimension of the linear space of signed invariant measures is at most the number of generating terms. A minimization problem is constructed in order to compute stationary measures numerically. Moreover, a heuristic linear approximation scheme is suggested for the same purpose by first approximating the generating terms. The correctness of the linear approximation scheme is justified in some special cases. Furthermore, a decomposition of the state space into different types of states (open and closed irreducible classes, and trapping, escaping and neutral states) is presented. Applications to stochastic reaction networks are well illustrated.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for semilinear slow-fast rough partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the averaging principle for a class of semilinear slow-fast partial differential equations driven by finite-dimensional rough multiplicative noise. Specifically, the slow component is driven by a general random $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder rough path for some $\gamma \in (1/3,1/2)$, while the fast component is driven by a Brownian rough path. Using controlled rough path theory and the classical Khasminskii's time discretization scheme, we demonstrate that the slow component converges strongly to the solution of the corresponding averaged equation under the H\"{o}lder topology.</description>

      <title>Airy kernel determinant solutions to the KdV equation and integro-differential Painlev\'e equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of unbounded solutions to the Korteweg-de Vries equation which can be constructed as log-derivatives of deformed Airy kernel Fredholm determinants, and which are connected to an integro-differential version of the second Painlev\'e equation. The initial data of the Korteweg-de Vries solutions are well-defined for $x&gt;0$, but not for $x&lt;0$, where the solutions behave like $\frac{x}{2t}$ as $t\to 0$, and hence would be well-defined as solutions of the cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries equation. We provide uniform asymptotics in $x$ as $t\to 0$; for $x&gt;0$ they involve an integro-differential analogue of the Painlev\'e V equation. A special case of our results yields improved estimates for the {tails} of the narrow wedge solution to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <title>Estimating the roughness exponent of stochastic volatility from discrete observations of the integrated variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the roughness of the volatility process in a stochastic volatility model that arises as a nonlinear function of fractional Brownian motion with drift. To this end, we introduce a new estimator that measures the so-called roughness exponent of a continuous trajectory, based on discrete observations of its antiderivative. The estimator has a very simple form and can be computed with great efficiency on large data sets. It is not derived from distributional assumptions but from strictly pathwise considerations. We provide conditions on the underlying trajectory under which our estimator converges in a strictly pathwise sense. Then we verify that these conditions are satisfied by almost every sample path of fractional Brownian motion (with drift). As a consequence, we obtain strong consistency theorems in the context of a large class of rough volatility models, such as the rough fractional volatility model and the rough Bergomi model. We also demonstrate that our estimator is robust with respect to proxy errors between the integrated and realized variance, and that it can be applied to estimate the roughness exponent directly from the price trajectory. Numerical simulations show that our estimation procedure performs well after passing to a scale-invariant modification of our estimator.</description>

      <title>A projected Euler Method for Random Periodic Solutions of Semi-linear SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work introduces and investigates an explicit time discretization scheme, called the projected Euler method,to numerically approximate random periodic solutions of semi-linear SDEs under non-globally Lipschitz conditions. The existence of the random periodic solution is demonstrated as the limit of the pull-back of the discretized SDE. Without relying on a priori high-order moment bounds of the numerical approximations, the mean square convergence rate of the approximation scheme is proved to be order $0.5$ for SDEs with multiplicative noise and order $1$ for SDEs with additive noise. Numerical examples are also provided to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Assuming a $q$-variant of the prime $k$-tuple conjecture uniformly, we compute mixed moments of the number of primes in disjoint short intervals and progressions, respectively. This involves estimating the mean of singular series along products of lattices, which is of independent interest. As a consequence, we establish the convergence of both sequences of suitably normalized primes to a standard Poisson point process.</description>

      <title>A new framework for identifying most reliable graphs and a correction to the $K_{3,3}$-theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a multigraph $G$, the all-terminal reliability $R(G,p)$ is the probability that $G$ remains connected under percolation with parameter $p$. Fixing the number of vertices $n$ and edges $m$, we investigate which graphs maximize $R(G,p)$ -- such graphs are called optimal -- paying particular attention to uniqueness and to whether the answer depends upon $p$. We generalize the concept of a distillation and build a framework with which we identify all optimal graphs for which $m-n\in\{1,2,3\}$. These graphs are uniformly optimal in $p$. Most have been previously identified, but with serious problems, especially when $m-n=3$. We obtain partial results for $m-n\in\{4,5\}$.
  For $m-n=3$, the optimal graphs were incorrectly identified by Wang in 1994, in the infinite number of cases where $m\equiv5\pmod{9}$ and $m\geq14$. This erroneous result concerns subdivisions of $K_{3,3}$ and has been cited extensively, without any mistake being detected. While the optimal graphs were correctly described for other $m$, the proof is fundamentally flawed. Our proof of the rectified statement is self-contained.
  For $m-n=4$, the optimal graphs were recently shown to depend upon $p$ for infinitely many $m$. We find a new such set of $m$-values, which gives a different perspective on why this phenomenon occurs and leads us to conjecture that uniformly optimal graphs exist only for finitely many $m$. However, for $m-n=5$, we conjecture that there are again infinitely many uniformly optimal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory of unimodal maps perturbed by an heteroscedastic Markov chain noise and experiencing another heteroscedastic noise due to uncertain observation. We address and treat the filtering problem showing that by collecting more and more observations, one would predict the same distribution for the state of the underlying Markov chain no matter one's initial guess. Moreover we give other limit theorems, emphasizing in particular concentration inequalities and extreme value and Poisson distributions. Our results apply to a family of maps arising from a model of systemic risk in finance.</description>
