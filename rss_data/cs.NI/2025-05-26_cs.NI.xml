      <title>PREAMBLE and IMRECEIVING for Improved Large Message Handling in libp2p GossipSub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large message transmissions in libp2p GossipSub lead to longer than expected network-wide message dissemination times and very high bandwidth utilization. This article identifies key issues responsible for this behavior and proposes modifications to the protocol for transmitting large messages. These modifications preserve the GossipSub resilience and fit well into the current algorithm. The proposed changes are rigorously evaluated for performance using the shadow simulator. Results reveal that the suggested changes reduce bandwidth utilization by up to 61% and message dissemination time by up to 35% under different traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Direct Feature Access -- Scaling Network Traffic Feature Collection to Terabit Speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time traffic monitoring is critical for network operators to ensure performance, security, and visibility, especially as encryption becomes the norm. AI and ML have emerged as powerful tools to create deeper insights from network traffic, but collecting the fine-grained features needed at terabit speeds remains a major bottleneck. We introduce Direct Feature Access (DFA): a high-speed telemetry system that extracts flow features at line rate using P4-programmable data planes, and delivers them directly to GPUs via RDMA and GPUDirect, completely bypassing the ML server's CPU. DFA enables feature enrichment and immediate inference on GPUs, eliminating traditional control plane bottlenecks and dramatically reducing latency. We implement DFA on Intel Tofino switches and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving extraction and delivery of over 31 million feature vectors per second, supporting 524,000 flows within sub-20 ms monitoring periods, on a single port. DFA unlocks scalable, real-time, ML-driven traffic analysis at terabit speeds, pushing the frontier of what is possible for next-generation network monitoring.</description>

      <title>Topology Partitioning-based Self-Organized Localization in Indoor WSNs with Unknown Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate indoor node localization is critical for practical Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, as Global Positioning System (GPS) fails to provide reliable Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions in most indoor environments. Real-world localization scenarios often involve unknown obstacles with unpredictable shapes, sizes, quantities, and layouts. These obstacles introduce significant deviations in measured distances between sensor nodes when communication links traverse them, severely compromising localization accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a robust range-based localization method that strategically identifies and severs obstructed communication paths, leveraging network topology to mitigate obstacle-induced errors. Across diverse obstacle configurations and node densities, the algorithm successfully severed 87% of obstacle-affected paths on average. Under the assumption that Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) provides accurate distance measurements under LoS conditions, the achieved localization accuracy exceeds 99.99%.</description>

      <title>User-UAV Association for Dynamic User in mmWave Communication for eMBB and URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) communication, appropriate user-UAV association is crucial for improving system performance. In mmWave communication, user throughput largely depends on the line of sight (LoS) connectivity with the UAV, which in turn depends on the mobility pattern of the users. Moreover, different traffic types like enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) may require different types of LoS connectivity. Existing user-UAV association policies do not consider the user mobility during a time interval and different LoS requirements of different traffic types. In this paper, we consider both of them and develop a user association policy in the presence of building blockages. First, considering a simplified scenario, we have analytically established the LoS area, which is the region where users will experience seamless LoS connectivity for eMBB traffic, and the LoS radius, which is the radius of the largest circle within which the user gets uninterrupted LoS services for URLLC traffic. Then, for a more complex scenario, we present a geometric shadow polygon-based method to compute LoS area and LoS radius. Finally, we associate eMBB and URLLC users, with the UAVs from which they get the maximum average throughput based on LoS area and maximum LoS radius respectively. We show that our approach outperforms the existing discretization based and maximum throughput based approaches.</description>

      <title>Joint Encryption and Error Correction for Secure Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18133v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secure quantum networks are a bedrock requirement for developing a future quantum internet. However, quantum channels are susceptible to channel noise that introduce errors in the transmitted data. The traditional approach to providing error correction typically encapsulates the message in an error correction code after encryption. Such separate processes incur overhead that must be avoided when possible. We, consequently, provide a single integrated process that allows for encryption as well as error correction. This is a first attempt to do so for secure quantum communication and combines the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the three-stage secure quantum communication protocol. Lastly, it allows for arbitrary qubits to be transmitted from sender to receiver making the proposed protocol general purpose.</description>

      <title>ARCANE: Adaptive Routing with Caching and Aware Network Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21625v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation datacenters require highly efficient network load balancing to manage the growing scale of artificial intelligence (AI) training and general datacenter traffic. Existing solutions designed for Ethernet, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and oblivious packet spraying (OPS), struggle to maintain high network utilizations as datacenter topologies (and network failures as a consequence) continue to grow. To address these limitations, we propose ARCANE, a lightweight decentralized per-packet adaptive load balancing algorithm designed to optimize network utilization while ensuring rapid recovery from link failures. ARCANE adapts to network conditions by caching good-performing paths. In case of a network failure, ARCANE re-routes traffic away from it in less than 100 microseconds. ARCANE is designed to be deployed with next-generation out-of-order transports, such as Ultra Ethernet, and introduces less than 25 bytes of per-connection state. We extensively evaluate ARCANE in large-scale simulations and FPGA-based NICs.</description>

      <title>MPLS Network Actions: Technological Overview and P4-Based Implementation on a High-Speed Switching ASIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In MPLS, packets are encapsulated with labels that add domain-specific forwarding information. Special purpose labels were introduced to trigger special behavior in MPLS nodes but their number is limited. Therefore, the IETF proposed the MPLS Network Actions (MNA) framework. It extends MPLS with new features, some of which have already been defined to support relevant use cases. This paper provides a comprehensive technological overview of MNA concepts and use cases. It compares MNA to IPv6 extension headers (EHs) that serve a similar purpose, and argues that MNA can be better deployed than EHs. It then presents P4-MNA, a first hardware implementation running at 400 Gb/s per port. Scalability and performance of P4-MNA are evaluated, showing negligible impact on processing delay caused by network actions. Moreover, the applicability of MNA is demonstrated by implementing the use cases of link-specific packet loss measurement using the alternate-marking-method (AMM) and bandwidth reservation using network slicing. We identify header stacking constraints resulting from hardware resources and from the number of network actions that must be supported according to the MNA encoding. They make an implementation for hardware that can only parse a few MPLS headers infeasible. We propose to make the number of supported network actions a node parameter and signal this in the network. Then, an upgrade to MNA is also feasible for hardware with fewer available resources. We explain that for MNA with in-stack data (ISD), some header bits must remain unchanged during forwarding, and give an outlook on post-stack data (PSD).</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Low-Latency Video Streaming in an ORAN Setup with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video streaming services depend on the underlying communication infrastructure and available network resources to offer ultra-low latency, high-quality content delivery. Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) provides a dynamic, programmable, and flexible RAN architecture that can be configured to support the requirements of time-critical applications. This work considers a setup in which the constrained network resources are supplemented by \gls{GAI} and \gls{MEC} {techniques} in order to reach a satisfactory video quality. Specifically, we implement a novel semantic control channel that enables \gls{MEC} to support low-latency applications by tight coupling among the ORAN xApp, \gls{MEC}, and the control channel. The proposed concepts are experimentally verified with an actual ORAN setup that supports video streaming. The performance evaluation includes the \gls{PSNR} metric and end-to-end latency. Our findings reveal that latency adjustments can yield gains in image \gls{PSNR}, underscoring the trade-off potential for optimized video quality in resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>TSA-WF: Exploring the Effectiveness of Time Series Analysis for Website Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Website fingerprinting (WF) is a technique that allows an eavesdropper to determine the website a target user is accessing by inspecting the metadata associated with the packets she exchanges via some encrypted tunnel, e.g., Tor. Recent WF attacks built using machine learning (and deep learning) process and summarize trace metadata during their feature extraction phases. This methodology leads to predictions that lack information about the instant at which a given website is detected within a (potentially large) network trace comprised of multiple sequential website accesses -- a setting known as \textit{multi-tab} WF.
  In this paper, we explore whether classical time series analysis techniques can be effective in the WF setting. Specifically, we introduce TSA-WF, a pipeline designed to closely preserve network traces' timing and direction characteristics, which enables the exploration of algorithms designed to measure time series similarity in the WF context. Our evaluation with Tor traces reveals that TSA-WF achieves a comparable accuracy to existing WF attacks in scenarios where website accesses can be easily singled-out from a given trace (i.e., the \textit{single-tab} WF setting), even when shielded by specially designed WF defenses. Finally, while TSA-WF did not outperform existing attacks in the multi-tab setting, we show how TSA-WF can help pinpoint the approximate instant at which a given website of interest is visited within a multi-tab trace.\footnote{This preprint has not undergone any post-submission improvements or corrections.
