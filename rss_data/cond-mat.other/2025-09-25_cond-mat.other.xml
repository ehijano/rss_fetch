      <title>Modeling Ferrimagnets in MuMax3: Temperature-Dependent Skyrmion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to modeling ferrimagnets in MuMax3. We show that by specifying two interacting magnetic sublattices as separate layers, it is possible to reproduce a sperimagnetic-like ordering of magnetization. In such a system, magnetic and angular momentum compensation states can be achieved only by varying the temperature while keeping other parameters fixed. This behavior arises from the different temperature dependencies of the magnetization projections in the sublattices, as determined by their thermal functions. We also investigated the motion of a skyrmion under the action of a spin-polarized current. By changing the temperature, we observed both the disappearance of the skyrmion Hall effect at the angular compensation point and the maximum velocity of translational motion. The latter effect requires a modified version of MuMax3 that allows the g-factor to be specified for different regions. The proposed approach can also be applied to study other phenomena in ferrimagnets, including the influence of composition on the magnetic and angular compensation temperatures, the tilted phase, domain-wall motion, and effects arising from non-uniform current or temperature distributions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Landau Levels in Inhomogeneous Fluxes and Emergent Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic topological and charge-ordered phases.</description>

      <title>(2+1)D Quantum Electrodynamics at Finite Density on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Performances of far and near-field thermophotonic refrigeration devices from the detailed-balance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a near-field thermophotonic (NF-TPX) refrigerating device, consisting of a lightemitting diode and a photovoltaic cell in close proximity. Calculations are performed in the frame of the detailed-balance approach. We study how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect both cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess the impact of bandgap energy and external quantum efficiency for an artificial material on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs and/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10% reduction of the external quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on electroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance prediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and hinge states of strained half-Heusler compounds LiSbZn and LiBiZn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: When present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials.</description>
