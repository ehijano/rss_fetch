      <title>Generalized Wright Analysis in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a broad class of non-Gaussian measures, $ \mu_\Psi$, associated with a family of generalized Wright functions, $_m\Psi_q$. First, we study these measures in Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$, then define them in an abstract nuclear triple $\mathcal{N}\subset\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{N}'$. We study analyticity, invariance properties, and ergodicity under a particular group of automorphisms. Then we show the existence of an Appell system which allows the extension of the non-Gaussian Hilbert space $L^2(\mu_\Psi)$ to the nuclear triple consisting of test functions' and distributions' spaces, $(\mathcal{N})^{1}\subset L^2(\mu_\Psi)\subset(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$. Thanks to this triple, we can study Donsker's delta as a well-defined object in the space of distributions $(\mathcal{N})_{\mu_\Psi}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The Gapeev-Shiryaev Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gapeev-Shiryaev conjecture (originating in Gapeev and Shiryaev (2011) and Gapeev and Shiryaev (2013)) can be broadly stated as follows: Monotonicity of the signal-to-noise ratio implies monotonicity of the optimal stopping boundaries. The conjecture was originally formulated both within (i) sequential testing problems for diffusion processes (where one needs to decide which of the two drifts is being indirectly observed) and (ii) quickest detection problems for diffusion processes (where one needs to detect when the initial drift changes to a new drift). In this paper we present proofs of the Gapeev-Shiryaev conjecture both in (i) the sequential testing setting (under Lipschitz/Holder coefficients of the underlying SDEs) and (ii) the quickest detection setting (under analytic coefficients of the underlying SDEs). The method of proof in the sequential testing setting relies upon a stochastic time change and pathwise comparison arguments. Both arguments break down in the quickest detection setting and get replaced by arguments arising from a stochastic maximum principle for hypoelliptic equations (satisfying Hormander's condition) that is of independent interest. Verification of the Gapeev-Shiryaev conjecture establishes the fact that sequential testing and quickest detection problems with monotone signal-to-noise ratios are amenable to known methods of solution.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of discrete-time Markov chains and their local times on electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that if a sequence of electrical networks equipped with natural measures converges in the local Gromov-Hausdorff-vague topology and satisfies certain non-explosion and metric-entropy conditions, then the sequence of associated discrete-time Markov chains and their local times also converges. This result applies to many examples, such as critical Galton-Watson trees, uniform spanning trees, random recursive fractals, the critical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph, the configuration model, and the random conductance model on fractals. To obtain the convergence result, we characterize and study extended Dirichlet spaces associated with resistance forms, and we study traces of electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Upper tails of subgraph counts in directed random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upper tail problem in a sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph asks for the probability that the number of copies of some fixed subgraph exceeds its expected value by a constant factor. We study the analogous problem for oriented subgraphs in directed random graphs. By adapting the proof of Cook, Dembo, and Pham, we reduce this upper tail problem to the asymptotic of a certain variational problem over edge weighted directed graphs. We give upper and lower bounds for the solution to the corresponding variational problem, which differ by a constant factor of at most $2$. We provide a host of subgraphs where the upper and lower bounds coincide, giving the solution to the upper tail problem. Examples of such digraphs include triangles, stars, directed $k$-cycles, and balanced digraphs.</description>

      <title>Pair coalescence times of ancestral lineages of two-dimensional logistic branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider two ancestral lineages sampled from a system of two-dimensional branching random walks with logistic regulation in the stationary regime. We study the asymptotics of their coalescence time for large initial separation and find that it agrees with well known results for a suitably scaled two-dimensional stepping stone model and also with Mal\'ecot's continuous-space approximation for the probability of identity by descent as a function of sampling distance. This can be viewed as a justification for the replacement of locally fluctuating population sizes by fixed effective sizes. Our main tool is a joint regeneration construction for the spatial embeddings of the two ancestral lineages.</description>

      <title>Mean field games with common noise via Malliavin calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an alternative proof to the existence of equilibria for mean field games with common noise. By adapting a compactness criterion for Malliavin differentiable random variables to random processes, we obtain strong equilibria, in which the conditional mean and optimal control are adapted and defined on the original probability space. The proof is simplified by the assumption that players interact through a conditional mean process instead of conditional probability measures as in the general case.</description>

      <title>On Smale's 17th problem over the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently solving a system of $n$ non-linear equations in ${\mathbb R}^d$. Addressing Smale's 17th problem stated in 1998, we consider a setting whereby the $n$ equations are random homogeneous polynomials of arbitrary degrees. In the complex case and for $n= d-1$, Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously developed methods do not apply. We describe an algorithm that efficiently finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$. If the maximal degree is very large, we also give an algorithm that works up to $n=d-1$.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating q-series identity and its applications to probability theory and random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In I981, Uchimura studied a divisor generating $q$-series that has applications in probability theory and in the analysis of data structures, called heaps. Mainly, he proved the following identity. For $|q|&lt;1$, \begin{equation*} \sum_{n=1}^\infty n q^n (q^{n+1})_\infty =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} q^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2} } }{(1-q^n) ( q)_n } = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ q^n }{1-q^n}. \end{equation*} Over the years, this identity has been generalized by many mathematicians in different directions. Uchimura himself in 1987, Dilcher (1995), Andrews-Crippa-Simon (1997), and recently Gupta-Kumar (2021) found a generalization of the aforementioned identity. Any generalization of the right most expression of the above identity, we name as divisor-type sum, whereas a generalization of the middle expression we say Ramanujan-type sum, and any generalization of the left most expression we refer it as Uchimura-type sum. Quite surprisingly, Simon, Crippa and Collenberg (1993) showed that the same divisor generating function has a connection with random acyclic digraphs. One of the main themes of this paper is to study these different generalizations and present a unified theory. We also discuss applications of these generalized identities in probability theory for the analysis of heaps and random acyclic digraphs.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of a degenerate stochastic system modeling the response of a population face to environmental impacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of a two-dimensional stochastic differential system with a degenerate diffusion matrix. This system describes the dynamics of a population where individuals contribute to the degradation of their environment through two different behaviors. We exploit the almost one-dimensional form of the dynamical system to compute explicitly the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional. That allows to give conditions under which the small noise regime of the invariant measureis concentrated around the equilibrium of the dynamical system having the smallest diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Equal Requests are Asymptotically Hardest for Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a distributed storage system serving hot data, the data recovery performance becomes important, captured e.g. by the service rate. We give partial evidence for it being hardest to serve a sequence of equal user requests (as in PIR coding regime) both for concrete and random user requests and server contents.
  We prove that a constant request sequence is locally hardest to serve: If enough copies of each vector are stored in servers, then if a request sequence with all requests equal can be served then we can still serve it if a few requests are changed.
  For random iid server contents, with number of data symbols constant (for simplicity) and the number of servers growing, we show that the maximum number of user requests we can serve divided by the number of servers we need approaches a limit almost surely. For uniform server contents, we show this limit is 1/2, both for sequences of copies of a fixed request and of any requests, so it is at least as hard to serve equal requests as any requests. For iid requests independent from the uniform server contents the limit is at least 1/2 and equal to 1/2 if requests are all equal to a fixed request almost surely, confirming the same.
  As a building block, we deduce from a 1952 result of Marshall Hall, Jr. on abelian groups, that any collection of half as many requests as coded symbols in the doubled binary simplex code can be served by this code. This implies the fractional version of the Functional Batch Code Conjecture that allows half-servers.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for out of equilibrium correlations in the symmetric simple exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For finite size Markov chains, the Donsker-Varadhan theory fully describes the large deviations of the time averaged empirical measure. We are interested in the extension of the Donsker-Varadhan theory for a large size non-equilibrium system: the one-dimensional symmetric simple exclusion process connected with reservoirs at different densities. The Donsker-Varadhan functional encodes a variety of scales depending on the observable of interest. In this paper, we focus on the time-averaged two point correlations and investigate the large deviations from the steady state behaviour. To control two point correlations out of equilibrium, the key input is the construction of a simple approximation to the invariant measure. This approximation is quantitative in time and space as estimated through relative entropy bounds building on the work of Jara and Menezes arXiv:1810.09526.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a disordered variant of Pitman's Chinese restaurant process where tables carry i.i.d. weights. Incoming customers choose to sit at an occupied table with a probability proportional to the product of its occupancy and its weight, or they sit at an unoccupied table with a probability proportional to a parameter $\theta&gt;0$. This is a system out of equilibrium where the proportion of customers at any given table converges to zero almost surely. We show that for weight distributions in any of the three extreme value classes, Weibull, Gumbel or Fr\'echet, the proportion of customers sitting at the largest table converges to one in probability, but not almost surely, and the proportion of customers sitting at either of the largest two tables converges to one almost surely.</description>

      <title>On the mean field theory of Ensemble Kalman filters for SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the mathematical analysis of continuous time Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKBFs) and their mean field limit in an infinite dimensional setting. The signal is determined by a nonlinear Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE), which is posed in the standard variational setting. Assuming global one-sided Lipschitz conditions and finite dimensional observations we first prove the well posedness of both the EnKBF and its corresponding mean field version. We then investigate the quantitative convergence of the EnKBF towards its mean field limit, recovering the rates suggested by the law of large numbers for bounded observation functions. The main tool hereby are exponential moment estimates for the empirical covariance of the EnKBF, which may be of independent interest. In the appendix of the paper we investigate the connection of the mean field EnKBF and the Stochastic Filtering Problem. In particular we derive the Feedback Particle Filter for infinite dimensional signals and show that the mean field EnKBF can viewed as its constant gain approximation.</description>

      <title>Increasing subsequences of linear size in random permutations and the Robinson-Schensted tableaux of permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of longest increasing subsequences (LIS) in permutations led to that of Young diagrams via Robinson-Schensted's (RS) correspondence. In a celebrated paper, Vershik and Kerov obtained a limit theorem for such diagrams and found that the LIS of a uniform permutation of size n behaves as $2\sqrt{n}$. Independently and much later, Hoppen et al. introduced the theory of permutons as a scaling limit of permutations. In this paper, we extend in some sense the RS correspondence of permutations to the space of permutons. When the "RS-tableaux" of a permuton are non-trivial, we show that the RS-tableaux of random permutations sampled from this permuton exhibit a linear behavior, in the sense that their first rows and columns have lengths of linear order. In particular, the LIS of such permutations behaves as a multiple of n. We also prove some large deviation results for these convergences. Finally, by studying asymptotic properties of Fomin's algorithm for permutations, we show that the RS-tableaux of a permuton satisfy a partial differential equation.</description>

Abstract: Consider an advantageous allele that arises in a haploid population of size $N$ evolving in continuous time according to a skewed reproduction mechanism, which generates under neutrality genealogies lying in the domain of attraction of a Beta$(2-\alpha, \alpha)$-coalescent for $\alpha \in (1,2)$. We prove in a setting of moderate selection that the fixation probability $\pi_N$ of the advantageous allele is asymptotically equal to $\alpha^{1/(\alpha-1)} s_N^{1/(\alpha-1)}$ , where $s_N$ is the selection strength of the advantageous allele. Our proof uses duality with a suitable $\Lambda$-ancestral selection graph.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
