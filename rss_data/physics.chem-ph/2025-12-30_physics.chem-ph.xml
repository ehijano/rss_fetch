      <title>A Mathematical Primer on Water Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water adopts many different crystal structures in its solid form. These provide insight into potential structures of water even in its liquid phase, and they can be used to calibrate pair potentials used for simulation of water. In crowded biological environments, water may behave more like ice than bulk water. The different ice structures have different dielectric properties. This brief primer is intended to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>A Unified Pore-Scale Multiphysics Model for the Integrated Soot Transport-Deposition-Oxidation in Catalytic Diesel Particulate Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate interplay between soot dynamics and chemical reactions within catalytic diesel particulate filters (CDPF) is crucial for enhancing both filtration efficiency and regeneration performance. In this paper, we establish a unified pore-scale multiphysics model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to comprehensively resolve the transport, deposition, and oxidation of soot. Distinguishing itself from conventional empirical correlations and stochastic-based approximations, the system models soot deposition through fundamental physical principles, integrating elastic deformation and surface adhesion mechanics at the particle-wall interface. Simultaneously, it incorporates a robust oxidation model that accounts for the competitive kinetics of both $\textrm{O}_2$ and $\textrm{NO}_2$ pathways, enabling comprehensive coverage of all CDPF operating regimes. Validated against three classical benchmark cases, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in capturing interfacial mass transfer and particle-wall interactions. Simulation under a typical CDPF low-temperature operating condition emphasizes the pivotal role of $\textrm{NO}_2$ and catalyst in promoting regeneration and reveals complex synergistic and competitive effects between distinct reaction pathways. Notably, the reaction rate of direct $\textrm{O}_2$ pathway is accelerated by a factor of 87 in the presence of the catalyst. For ultra-fine soot particles ($50~\mathrm{nm}$), the Brownian motion and thermophoretic forces directly dictate the deposition efficiency. Their strong thermal sensitivity also underscores the necessity for an integrated soot transport-deposition-oxidation framework.

      <description>arXiv:2512.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How quantum electron and nuclei motions affect biomolecular chemical reactions remains a central challengeable question at the interface of quantum chemistry and biology. Ultrafast charge migration in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has long been hypothesized to play a critical role in photochemistry, genome stability, and long-range biomolecular signaling, however, direct real-time observation of these electronic processes has remained elusive. Here, we present a theoretical investigation and propose the concept of future experimental measurements of laser-driven charge dynamics in the canonical DNA nucleobase pairs thymine_adenine and cytosine_guanine. Attosecond-resolved simulations employing high-level ab initio methods reveal base-dependent ionization mechanisms, directional charge migration pathways, and electronic coherences that govern sub-femtosecond redistribution of electron density across hydrogen-bonded nucleobase interfaces. Accordingly, we propose the concept of a quantum attosecond scanning electron microscope, termed the quantum attomicroscope (Q-attomicroscope), a capable of imaging photoinduced quantum chemistry reactions in attosecond temporal resolution and sub-nanometer spatial precision. As a proof of principle, we propose to image the charge migrations dynamics in DNA which we studied theoretically. Together, our preceptive bridges theory, instrumentation, and control, outlining a pathway toward laser mediated manipulation of DNA structure with implications for repair processes, chemical reactivity, and future personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>MO-HEOM: Extending Hierarchical Equations of Motion to Molecular Orbital Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of quantum thermal effects on molecular excitation dynamics have often relied on oversimplified models, such as energy eigenstates or low-dimensional potentials, which fail to capture the complexity of real chemical systems. In reality, molecules are spatially extended and embedded in anisotropic environments, where molecular orbitals (MOs) play a central role in determining quantum behavior. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra.</description>

      <title>QSAR-Guided Generative Framework for the Discovery of Synthetically Viable Odorants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fr\'echet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ....</description>

      <title>The Open Polymers 2026 (OPoly26) Dataset and Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers-macromolecular systems composed of repeating chemical units-constitute the molecular foundation of living organisms, while their synthetic counterparts drive transformative advances across medicine, consumer products, and energy technologies. While machine learning (ML) models have been trained on millions of quantum chemical atomistic simulations for materials and/or small molecular structures to enable efficient, accurate, and transferable predictions of chemical properties, polymers have largely not been included in prior datasets due to the computational expense of high quality electronic structure calculations on representative polymeric structures. Here, we address this shortcoming with the creation of the Open Polymers 2026 (OPoly26) dataset, which contains more than 6.57 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations on up to 360 atom clusters derived from polymeric systems, comprising over 1.2 billion total atoms. OPoly26 captures the chemical diversity that makes polymers intrinsically tunable and versatile materials, encompassing variations in monomer composition, degree of polymerization, chain architectures, and solvation environments. We show that augmenting ML model training with the OPoly26 dataset improves model performance for polymer prediction tasks. We also publicly release the OPoly26 dataset to help further the development of ML models for polymers, and more broadly, strive towards universal atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Isotope Effects and the Negative Thermal Expansion Phenomena in Ice and Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems.</description>

      <title>Toward reducing the formation temperature of diopside via wet-chemical synthesis routes using chloride precursors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination.</description>

      <title>The Role of THz Phonons in the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ Polymorphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.</description>

      <title>Energy-Guided Flow Matching Enables Few-Step Conformer Generation and Ground-State Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating low-energy conformer ensembles and identifying ground-state conformations from molecular graphs remain computationally demanding with physics-based pipelines. Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Predicting random close packing of binary hard-disk mixtures via third-virial-based parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and accurate approach to estimate the random close packing (RCP) fraction of binary hard-disk mixtures. By introducing a parameter based on the reduced third virial coefficient of the mixture, we show that the RCP fraction depends nearly linearly on this parameter, leading to a universal collapse of simulation data across a wide range of size ratios and compositions. Comparisons with previous models by Brouwers and Zaccone demonstrate that our approach provides the most consistent and accurate predictions. The method can be naturally extended to polydisperse mixtures with continuous size distributions, offering a robust framework for understanding the universality of RCP in hard-disk systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) serves as the basis for many expressions of spectroscopic observables and quantum transition rates. The utility of FGR has been demonstrated through decades of experimental confirmation. However, there still remain important cases where the evaluation of a FGR rate is ambiguous or ill-defined. Examples are cases where the rate has divergent terms due to the sparsity in the density of final states or time dependent fluctuations of system Hamiltonians. Strictly speaking, assumptions of FGR are no longer valid for such cases. However, it is still possible to define modified FGR rate expressions that are useful as effective rates. The resulting modified FGR rate expressions resolve a long standing ambiguity often encountered in using FGR and offer more reliable ways to model general rate processes. Simple model calculations illustrate the utility and implications of new rate expressions.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing high-dimensional potential energy surfaces for molecular systems and materials is considered to be a great challenge in computational chemistry with potential impact in a range of areas including the fundamental prediction of reaction rates. In this paper, we design and discuss an algorithm that has similarities to large language models in generative AI and natural language processing. Specifically, we represent a molecular system as a graph which contains a set of nodes, edges, faces, etc. Interactions between these sets, which represent molecular subsystems in our case, are used to construct the potential energy surface for a reasonably sized chemical system with 51 nuclear dimensions. For this purpose, a family of neural networks that pertain to the graph-theoretically obtained subsystems get the job done for this 51 nuclear dimensional system. We then ask if this same family of lower-dimensional graph-based neural networks can be transformed to provide accurate predictions for a 186-dimensional potential energy surface. We find that our algorithm does provide accurate results for this larger-dimensional problem with sub-kcal/mol accuracy for the higher-dimensional potential energy surface problem. Indeed, as a result of these developments, here we produce the first efforts towards a full-dimensional potential energy surface for the protonated 21-water cluster (186 nuclear dimensions) at CCSD level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>

Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of MCrAlYTa coatings modified with Pt-Ru overlays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of varying Pt/Ru ratios on the oxidation mechanism of NiCoCrAlYTa coatings with electrodeposited, vacuum-annealed Ptsingle bondRu overlays. Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering.</description>
