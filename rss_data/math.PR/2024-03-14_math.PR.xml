      <title>Existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the generalized stochastic Navier-Stokes-Voigt equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the incompressible generalized Navier-Stokes-Voigt equations in a bounded domain $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$, driven by a multiplicative Gaussian noise. The considered momentum equation is given by:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d}\left(\boldsymbol{u} - \kappa \Delta \boldsymbol{u}\right) = \left[\boldsymbol{f} +\operatorname{div} \left(-\pi\mathbf{I}+\nu|\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{u})|^{p-2}\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{u})-\boldsymbol{u}\otimes \boldsymbol{u}\right)\right]\mathrm{d} t + \Phi(\boldsymbol{u})\mathrm{d} \mathrm{W}(t).
  \end{align*} In the case of $d=2,3$, $\boldsymbol{u}$ accounts for the velocity field, $\pi$ is the pressure, $\boldsymbol{f}$ is a body force and the final term stay for the stochastic forces. Here, $\kappa$ and $\nu$ are given positive constants that account for the kinematic viscosity and relaxation time, and the power-law index $p$ is another constant (assumed $p&gt;1$) that characterizes the flow. We use the usual notation $\mathbf{I}$ for the unit tensor and $\mathbf{D}(\boldsymbol{u}):=\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla \boldsymbol{u} + (\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^{\top}\right)$ for the symmetric part of velocity gradient. For $p\in\big(\frac{2d}{d+2},\infty\big)$, we first prove the existence of a martingale solution. Then we show the pathwise uniqueness of solutions. We employ the classical Yamada-Watanabe theorem to ensure the existence of a unique probabilistic strong solution.Then we show the pathwise uniqueness of solutions.

      <title>Eigenvalues of Product of Ginibre Ensembles and Their Inverses and that of Truncated Haar Unitary Matrices and Their Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider two types of products of independent random matrices, including products of Ginibre matrices and inverse Ginibre matrices and products of truncated Haar unitary matrices and inverse truncated Haar matrices. Each product matrix has $m$ multiplicands of $n$ by $n$ square matrices, and the empirical distribution based on the $n$ eigenvalues of the product matrix is called empirical spectral distribution of the matrix. In this paper, we investigate the limiting empirical spectral distribution of the product matrices when $n$ tends to infinity and $m$ changes with $n$. For properly rescaled eigenvalues for two types of the product matrices, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the empirical spectral distributions.</description>

      <title>The top eigenvalue of uniformly random trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathbf T}_n$ be a uniformly random tree with vertex set $[n]=\{1,\ldots,n\}$, let $\Delta_{{\mathbf T}_n}$ be the largest vertex degree in ${\mathbf T}_n$, and let $\lambda_1({\mathbf T}_n)$ be the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. We prove that $|\lambda_1({\mathbf T}_n)-\sqrt{\Delta_{{\mathbf T}_n}}| \to 0$ in expectation as $n \to \infty$, and additionally prove probability tail bounds for $|\lambda_1({\mathbf T}_n)-\sqrt{\Delta_{{\mathbf T}_n}}|$. The proof is based on the trace method and thus on counting closed walks in a random tree. To this end, we develop novel combinatorial tools for encoding walks in trees that we expect will find other applications. In order to apply these tools, we show that uniformly random trees -- after appropriate "surgery" -- satisfy, with high probability, the properties required for the combinatorial bounds to be effective.</description>

      <title>Quenched CLT for ancestral lineages of logistic branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random walks in dynamic random environments which arise naturally as spatial embeddings of ancestral lineages in spatial locally regulated population models. In particular, as the main result, we prove the quenched central limit theorem for a random walk in dynamic random environment generated by time reversal of logistic branching random walks in a regime where the population density is sufficiently high. As an important tool we consider as auxiliary models random walks in dynamic random environments defined in terms of the time-reversal of oriented percolation. We show that the quenched central limit theorem holds if the influence of the random medium on the walks is suitably weak. The proofs of the quenched central limit theorems in these models rely on coarse-graining arguments and a construction of regeneration times for a pair of conditionally independent random walks in the same medium, combined with a coupling that relates them to a pair of independent random walks in two independent copies of the medium.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Anderson equations with general time-independent Gaussian noise: Stratonovich regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the
  hyperbolic Anderson equation
  generated by a time-independent Gaussian noise
  with two objectives: The solvability and intermittency.
  First, we prove that Dalang's condition is necessary and sufficient
  for existence of the solution. Second, we establish the
  precise long time and high moment asymptotics for the solution under
  the usual homogeneity assumption of the covariance of the Gaussian noise.
  Our approach is fundamentally different from the ones existing in
  literature.
  The main contributions in our approach include the representation of Stratonovich
  moment under Laplace transform via the moments of the Brownian motions in
  Gaussian potentials
  and some large deviation skills developed
  in dealing effectively with the Stratonovich chaos expansion.</description>

      <title>On the large deviation principle for Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chains: the Lyapunov function condition and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an aim to analyse the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, in our recent work we derive a large deviation principle (LDP) for the empirical measures of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) chains on a continuous state space. One of the (sufficient) assumptions for the LDP involves the existence of a particular type of Lyapunov function, and it was left as an open question whether or not such a function exists for specific choices of MH samplers. In this paper we analyse the properties of such Lyapunov functions and investigate their existence for some of the most popular choices of MCMC samplers built on MH dynamics: Independent Metropolis Hastings, Random Walk Metropolis, and the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. We establish under what conditions such a Lyapunov function exists, and from this obtain LDPs for some instances of the MCMC algorithms under consideration. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first large deviation results for empirical measures associated with Metropolis-Hastings chains for specific choices of proposal and target distributions.</description>

      <title>Sticky-threshold diffusions, local time approximation and parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of high frequency path functionals of a diffusion with a sticky-oscillating-skew (SOS) threshold, including the case of a sticky-reflection, and establish convergence to the local time. This extends existing results on sticky, oscillating (regime-switching) and skew or reflecting diffusions in several directions. First, it considers any normalizing sequence $(u_n)_n $ that diverges slower than $n$. Second, it allows combinations of these features. Based on this, and an approximation of the occupation time, we devise consistent skew and stickiness parameter estimators.</description>

      <title>On the universal properties of stochastic processes under optimally tuned Poisson restart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poisson restart assumes that a stochastic process is interrupted and starts again at random time moments. A number of studies have demonstrated that this strategy may minimize the expected completion time in some classes of random search tasks. What is more, it turned out that under optimally tuned restart rate, any stochastic process, regardless of its nature and statistical details, satisfies a number of universal relations for the statistical moments of completion time. In this paper, we describe several new universal properties of optimally restarted processes. Also we obtain a universal inequality for the quadratic statistical moments of completion time in the optimization problem where stochastic process has several possible completion scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We prove a stochastic maximum principle for a control problem where the state equation is delayed both in the state and in the control, and also the final cost functional may depend on the past trajectories. The adjoint equations turn out to be a new form of linear anticipated backward stochastic differential equations (ABSDEs in the following), and we prove a direct formula to solve these equations.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem for the variation of the sum of digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Central Limit Theorem for probability measures defined via the variation of the sum-of-digits function, in base $b\ge 2$. For $r\ge 0$ and $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, we consider $\mu^{(r)}(d)$ as the density of integers $n\in \mathbb{N}$ for which the sum of digits increases by $d$ when we add $r$ to $n$. We give a probabilistic interpretation of $\mu^{(r)}$ on the probability space given by the group of $b$-adic integers equipped with the normalized Haar measure. We split the base-$b$ expansion of the integer $r$ into so-called "blocks", and we consider the asymptotic behaviour of $\mu^{(r)}$ as the number of blocks goes to infinity. We show that, up to renormalization, $\mu^{(r)}$ converges to the standard normal law as the number of blocks of $r$ grows to infinity. We provide an estimate of the speed of convergence. The proof relies, in particular, on a $\phi$-mixing process defined on the $b$-adic integers.</description>

      <title>Operator semigroups in the mixed topology and the infinitesimal description of Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a class of not necessarily linear $C_0$-semigroups $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ on $C_b(E)$ (more generally, on $C_\kappa(E):=\frac1\kappa C_b(E)$, for some bounded function $\kappa$, which is the pointwise limit of a decreasing sequence of continuous functions) equipped with the mixed topology $\tau_1^{\mathscr M}$ for a large class of topological state spaces $E$. If these semigroups are linear, classical theory of operator semigroups on locally convex spaces as well as the theory of bicontinuous semigroups apply to them. In particular, they are infinitesimally generated by their generator $(L,D(L))$ and thus reconstructable through an Euler formula from their strong derivative at zero in $(C_b(E),\tau_1^{\mathscr M})$. In the linear case, we characterize such $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ as integral operators given by measure kernels satisfying certain tightness properties. As a consequence, transition semigroups of Markov processes are $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_b(E),\tau_1^{\mathscr M})$, if they leave $C_b(E)$ invariant and they are jointly weakly continuous in space and time. Hence, they can be reconstructed from their strong derivative at zero and thus have a fully infinitesimal description. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a Markov core operator $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for the above generators $(L,D(L))$ and prove that uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations corresponding to $(L_0,D(L_0))$ for all Dirac initial conditions implies that $(L_0,D(L_0))$ is a Markov core operator for $(L,D(L))$. If each $P_t$ is merely convex, we prove that $(P_t)_{t\geq0}$ gives rise to viscosity solutions to the Cauchy problem given by its associated (nonlinear) infinitesimal generator. We also show that value functions of optimal control problems, both, in finite and infinite dimensions are particular instances of convex $C_0$-semigroups on $(C_\kappa(E),\tau_\kappa^{\mathscr M})$.</description>

      <title>Multi-component Matching Queues in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider multi-component matching systems in heavy traffic consisting of $K\geq 2$ distinct perishable components which arrive randomly over time at high speed at the assemble-to-order station, and they wait in their respective queues according to their categories until matched or their ``patience" runs out. An instantaneous match occurs if all categories are available, and the matched components leave immediately thereafter. For a sequence of such systems parameterized by $n$, we establish an explicit definition for the matching completion process, and when all the arrival rates tend to infinity in concert as $n\to\infty$, we obtain a heavy traffic limit of the appropriately scaled queue lengths under mild assumptions, which is characterized by a coupled stochastic integral equation with a scalar-valued non-linear term. We demonstrate some crucial properties for certain coupled equations and exhibit numerical case studies. Moreover, we establish an asymptotic Little's law, which reveals the asymptotic relationship between the queue length and its virtual waiting time. Motivated by the cost structure of blood bank drives, we formulate an infinite-horizon discounted cost functional and show that the expected value of this cost functional for the nth system converges to that of the heavy traffic limiting process as n tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>The Liouville theorem for a class of Fourier multipliers and its connection to coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Liouville property says that all bounded harmonic functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, i.e.\ all bounded functions satisfying $\Delta f = 0$, are constant. In this paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions on the symbol of a Fourier multiplier operator $m(D)$, such that the solutions $f$ to $m(D)f=0$ are Lebesgue a.e.\ constant (if $f$ is bounded) or coincide Lebesgue a.e.\ with a polynomial (if $f$ grows like a polynomial). The class of Fourier multipliers includes the (in general non-local) generators of L\'evy processes. For generators of L\'evy processes we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a strong Liouville theorem where $f$ is positive and grows at most exponentially fast. As an application of our results above we prove a coupling result for space-time L\'evy processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the singular values of certain Young diagram shaped random matrices. For block-shaped random matrices, the empirical distribution of the squares of the singular eigenvalues converges almost surely to a distribution whose moments are a generalisation of the Catalan numbers. The limiting distribution is the density of a product of rescaled independent Beta random variables and its Stieltjes-Cauchy transform has a hypergeometric representation. In special cases we recover the Marchenko-Pastur and Dykema-Haagerup measures of square and triangular random matrices, respectively. We find a further factorisation of the moments in terms of two complex-valued random variables that generalises the factorisation of the Marcenko-Pastur law as product of independent uniform and arcsine random variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A previous paper by the authors found explicit contour integral formulas for certain joint moments of the multi-species q-TAZRP (totally asymmetric zero range process), using algebraic methods. These contour integral formulas have a "pseudo-factorized" form which makes asymptotic analysis simpler. In this brief note, we use those contour integral formulas to find the asymptotics of the two-point correlations. As expected, the term arising from the "shift-invariance" makes a non-trivial asymptotic contribution.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>State Re-union Maintainability for Semi-Markov Models in Manpower Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous research the importance of both Markov and semi-Markov models in manpower planning is highlighted. Maintainability of population structures for different types of personnel strategies (i.e. under control by promotion and control by recruitment) were extensively investigated for various types of Markov models (homogeneous as well as non-homogeneous) (Bartholomew, 1967; Vassiliou and Tsantas, 1984a). Semi-Markov models are extensions of Markov models that account for duration of stay in the states. Less attention is paid to the study of maintainability for semi-Markov models. Although, some interesting maintainability results were obtained for non-homogeneous semi-Markov models (Vassiliou and Papadopoulou, 1992). The current paper focuses on discrete-time homogeneous semi-Markov models, and explores the concept of maintainable population structures in this setting for a system with constant total size or one with a growth factor. In particular, a new concept of maintainability is introduced, the so called State Re-union maintainability (SR-maintainability). Moreover, we show that, under certain conditions, the seniority-based paths associated with the SR-maintainable structures converge. This allows to characterize the convex set of SR-maintainable structures.</description>

      <title>Tightness of exponential metrics for log-correlated Gaussian fields in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the tightness of a natural approximation scheme for an analog of the Liouville quantum gravity metric on $\mathbb R^d$ for arbitrary $d\geq 2$. More precisely, let $\{h_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a suitable sequence of Gaussian random functions which approximates a log-correlated Gaussian field on $\mathbb R^d$. Consider the family of random metrics on $\mathbb R^d$ obtained by weighting the lengths of paths by $e^{\xi h_n}$, where $\xi &gt; 0$ is a parameter. We prove that if $\xi$ belongs to the subcritical phase (which is defined by the condition that the distance exponent $Q(\xi)$ is greater than $\sqrt{2d}$), then after appropriate re-scaling, these metrics are tight and that every subsequential limit is a metric on $\mathbb R^d$ which induces the Euclidean topology. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure approach, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to $\gamma = (\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to generalize Hanson Wright inequality, we express $\gamma$ with the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and further consider the case where $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables to provide useful insights to the so-called "multilevel concentration".</description>

      <title>On optimal error rates for strong approximation of SDEs with a drift coefficient of fractional Sobolev regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study strong approximation of scalar additive noise driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs) at time point $1$ in the case that the drift coefficient is bounded and has Sobolev regularity $s\in(0,1)$. Recently, it has been shown in [arXiv:2101.12185v2 (2022)] that for such SDEs the equidistant Euler approximation achieves an $L^2$-error rate of at least $(1+s)/2$, up to an arbitrary small $\varepsilon$, in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion $W$. In the present article we prove a matching lower error bound for $s\in(1/2,1)$. More precisely we show that, for every $s\in(1/2,1)$, the $L^2$-error rate $(1+s)/2$ can, up to a logarithmic term, not be improved in general by no numerical method based on finitely many evaluations of $W$ at fixed time points. Up to now, this result was known in the literature only for the cases $s=1/2-$ and $s=1-$.
  For the proof we employ the coupling of noise technique recently introduced in [arXiv:2010.00915 (2020)] to bound the $L^2$-error of an arbitrary approximation from below by the $L^2$-distance of two occupation time functionals provided by a specifically chosen drift coefficient with Sobolev regularity $s$ and two solutions of the corresponding SDE with coupled driving Brownian motions. For the analysis of the latter distance we employ a transformation of the original SDE to overcome the problem of correlated increments of the difference of the two coupled solutions, occupation time estimates to cope with the lack of regularity of the chosen drift coefficient around the point $0$ and scaling properties of the drift coefficient.</description>

      <title>Strong survival and extinction for branching random walks via a new order for generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general discrete-time branching random walks on a countable set $X$. According to these processes, a particle at $x\in X$ generates a random number of children and places them at (some of) the sites of $X$, not necessarily independently nor with the same law at different starting vertices $x$.We introduce a new type of stochastic ordering of branching random walks, generalizing the germ order introduced by Hutchcroft in arXiv:2011.06402, which relies on the generating function of the process. We prove that given two branching random walks with law $\mathbf{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\nu}$ respectively, with $\mathbf{\mu} \ge \mathbf{\nu}$, then in every set where there is extinction according to $\mathbf{\mu}$, there is extinction also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$. Moreover, in every set where there is strong local survival according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, there is strong local survival also according to $\mathbf{\nu}$, provided that the supremum of the global extinction probabilities, for the $\mathbf{\nu}$-process, taken over all starting points $x$, is strictly smaller than 1. New conditions for survival and strong survival for inhomogeneous branching random walks are provided. We also extend a result of Moyal which claims that, under some conditions, the global extinction probability for a branching random walk is the only fixed point of its generating function, whose supremum over all starting coordinates, may be equal to 1.</description>

      <title>An unexpected stochastic dominance: Pareto distributions, dependence, and diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find the perhaps surprising inequality that the weighted average of independent and identically distributed Pareto random variables with infinite mean is larger than one such random variable in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance. This result holds for more general models including super-Pareto distributions, negative dependence, and triggering events, and yields superadditivity of the risk measure Value-at-Risk for these models.</description>

      <title>Existence of martingale solutions to a nonlinearly coupled stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlinear stochastic fluid-structure interaction problem with a multiplicative, white-in-time noise. The problem consists of the Navier-Stokes equations describing the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid in a 2D cylinder interacting with an elastic lateral wall whose elastodynamics is described by a membrane/shell equation. The flow is driven by the inlet and outlet data, and by the stochastic forcing. The stochastic noise is applied both to the fluid equations as a volumetric body force, and to the structure as an external forcing to the deformable fluid boundary. The fluid and the structure are nonlinearly coupled via the kinematic and dynamic conditions assumed at the moving interface, which is a random variable not known a priori. The geometric nonlinearity due to the nonlinear coupling requires the development of new techniques to capture martingale solutions for this class of stochastic fluid-structure interaction problems. We introduce a constructive approach based on a Lie splitting scheme and prove the existence of martingale solutions to the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in the field of stochastic PDEs that addresses existence of solutions on moving fluid domains involving incompressible viscous fluids, where the displacement of the boundary and the fluid domain are random variables that are not known a priori and are parts of the solution itself.</description>

      <title>Cyclical Long Memory: Decoupling, Modulation, and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new model for general cyclical long memory is introduced, by means of random modulation of certain bivariate long memory time series. This construction essentially decouples the two key features of cyclical long memory: quasi-periodicity and long-term persistence. It further allows for a general cyclical phase in cyclical long memory time series. Several choices for suitable bivariate long memory series are discussed, including a parametric fractionally integrated vector ARMA model. The parametric models introduced in this work have explicit autocovariance functions that can be used readily in simulation, estimation, and other tasks.</description>
