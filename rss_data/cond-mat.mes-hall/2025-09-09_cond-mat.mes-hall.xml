      <title>Spin-transport characteristics in a Si-based spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET): Bias dependence of the spin polarization in Si and magnetoresistance in spin-valve signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the spin transport characteristics of a spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET), particularly the bias voltage dependence of the electron spin polarization P_S in Si and the magnetoresistance ratio MR in spin-valve signals, to optimize the device performance. The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back gate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of Fe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off ratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were observed at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain V_DS bias voltages. We achieved a high P_S of 50% and a high MR of 0.35% as the maximum values in their single-peaked curves plotted as a function of the junction voltage V_J, mainly because the ferromagnetic S/D junction can generate high P_S and the spin diffusion length is very long in the Si inversion channel. These P_S and MR values are the highest ever reported in spin-MOSFETs. Our spin transport model for our spin MOSFET structure was improved in this study by taking into account the electron distribution and band profile of the n+-Si regions in the ferromagnetic S/D junctions, which enables the accurate estimation of P_S. Detailed analyses with various V_GS and V_J clarified that P_S is determined only by V_J. Our analyses also revealed that the main parameters for determining MR, such as P_S and the resistance-area products of the S/D ferromagnetic junctions, have different V_J dependences, leading to the finding that the present device does not exploit the full potential of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions to maximize MR. Based on the results, we discuss the device physics and engineering for further enhancement of MR, with a focus on the electrical and spin-related properties of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions.</description>

      <title>Wilson-Loop-Ideal Bands and General Idealization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\'e Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics.</description>

      <title>Giant Molecular Toroidal Moment Amenable to Direct Observation in a Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single molecule toroics (SMTs) atomic spins and orbital currents generate magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, endowed with both magnetic and electric dipole symmetries, which can enable spin control via magnetoelectric effects as well as the development of robust qubits. In the archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is challenging to detect and control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning a $\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility $\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser pulses. Our findings could thus pave the way for direct observation and manipulation of molecular toroidal moments.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall phases in gated rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene (RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Ambipolar Josephson Current in a Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Hybridization-Induced Ising-Type Superconductivity in a Confined Gallium Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-dimensional superconductors, the interplay between quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects can reshape Cooper pair wavefunctions and induce novel forms of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we employ a plasma-free, carbon buffer layer-assisted confinement epitaxy method to synthesize trilayer gallium (Ga) sandwiched between a graphene layer and a 6H-SiC(0001) substrate, forming an air-stable graphene/trilayer Ga/SiC heterostructure. In this confined light-element Ga layer, we demonstrate interfacial Ising-type superconductivity driven by atomic orbital hybridization between the Ga layer and the SiC substrate. Electrical transport measurements reveal that the in-plane upper critical magnetic field u0Hc2,|| reaches ~21.98T at T=400 mK, approximately 3.38 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit (~6.51T). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements combined with theoretical calculations confirm the presence of split Fermi surfaces with Ising-type spin textures at the K and K' valleys of the confined Ga layer strongly hybridized with SiC. Moreover, by incorporating finite relaxation time induced by impurity scattering into an Ising-type superconductivity model, we reproduce the entire temperature-dependent u0Hc2,|| phase diagram. This work establishes a new strategy to realize unconventional pairing wavefunctions by combining quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects in superconducting thin films. It also opens new avenues for designing scalable superconducting quantum electronic and spintronic devices through interfacial engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Modified Quantum Wheatstone Bridge based on current circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a simple fermionic system designed to detect an unknown hopping rate between two sites by analyzing current circulation. The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Crystallization in the Winterbottom shape and sharp fluctuation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address finite crystallization in two dimensions in the presence of a flat crystalline substrate. Particles interact through short-range two- and three-body potentials favoring local square-lattice arrangements. An additional interaction term of relative strength $\beta&gt;0$ couples the particles and the substrate. Our first main result proves crystallization for all $\beta&gt;0$, corresponding to
  the onset of discrete Winterbottom configurations. The proof relies on a stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond graph of minimizing configurations.
  Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\beta\in (0,1)$. We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\beta$ is rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws. As a corollary, we derive a discrete-to-continuum convergence of minimizers towards the Winterbottom equilibrium shape in the large-particle limit.</description>

      <title>LabelImg: CNN-Based Surface Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the journey of computer vision system development, the acquisition and utilization of annotated images play a central role, providing information about object identity, spatial extent, and viewpoint in depicted scenes. However, thermal manufacturing processes like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) often yield surfaces with defects such as Spatter, Crack, Pinhole, and Hole due to the Balling phenomenon. Preprocessing images from LPBF, riddled with defects, presents challenges in training machine learning (ML) algorithms. Detecting defects is critical for predicting production quality and identifying crucial points in artificial or natural structures. This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and segment surface defects like cracks, spatter, holes, and pinholes on production surfaces. In contrast to traditional machine learning techniques requiring extensive processing time and manual feature crafting, deep learning proves more accurate. The proposed architecture undergoes training and testing on 14,982 labeled images annotated using the LabelImg tool. Each object in the images is manually annotated with bounding boxes and segmented masks. The trained CNN, coupled with OpenCV preprocessing techniques, achieves an impressive 99.54% accuracy on the dataset with resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics for 50 true crack tests demonstrate precision, recall, and F1-score exceeding 96%, 98%, and 97%, respectively. Similarly, for 124 true pinhole tests, the metrics are 99%, 100%, and 100%, for 258 true hole tests, they are 99%, 99%, and 99%, and for 318 spatter tests, the metrics are 100%, 99%, and 100%. These results highlight the precision and effectiveness of the entire process, showcasing its potential for reliable defect detection in production surfaces.</description>

      <title>Total Faraday rotation by the Hall effect in a 2D electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the realization of near total Faraday rotation of $\theta_F$=1.43 rad (82 degrees) on a single pass through a 2D electron gas (2DEG), approaching the ideal limit of $\pi/2$ rad (90 degrees). The corresponding Verdet constant V = $9.5\times10^{8}$ rad T$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, exceeds by approximately one order of magnitude that reported in other material systems. Our measurements were conducted at microwave frequencies (f=9.2-11.2 GHz) in a 2DEG with a high dc mobility $\mu$ = $7\times10^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, in a hollow waveguide at low-magnetic field (B &lt; 200 mT). Near-total Faraday rotation is attributed to the Hall effect with weak radiative coupling to the 2DEG in the inertial, collisionless regime, $\omega \tau \gg 1$, where $\tau$ is the charge transport scattering time. A conducting iris was used to realize weak radiative coupling. Under these conditions, Faraday rotation is strongly enhanced away from the dissipation peak at cyclotron resonance. Our work demonstrates that the classical Hall effect could be ideally suited for the implementation of ideal non-reciprocal devices.</description>

      <title>Extended Hubbard Model realized in 2D clusters of molecular anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t&lt;&lt;U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Kinetic equation from Landau level basis: Beyond relaxation-time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to quantum thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.</description>

      <title>Magnetic inertia induced spin-wave dispersion in two-sublattice ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally observed in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by incorporating the full magnetic inertia tensor. Decomposing the tensor into its symmetric and antisymmetric components allows us to identify isotropic, anisotropic, and chiral contributions to the magnetic inertia. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum consists of two precessional magnon bands and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional magnon band crosses the lower inertial magnon band within the Brillouin zone. We show that both cross-sublattice inertia and chiral inertia provide effective tuning knobs for these magnon band structures. Furthermore, our results reveal that the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along directions where the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. On the other hand, a nonreciprocal spin-wave spectrum can also be engineered through chiral inertia, even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings open avenues for engineering nonreciprocal magnonic devices and ultrafast spintronic applications through control of magnetic inertia.</description>

      <title>Topological energy pumping in a quasi-periodically driven four-level system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.</description>

      <title>Relation between chiral anomaly and electric transport in $1D$ Dirac semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of chiral anomaly and dissipation in one - dimensional Dirac semimetal. For definiteness we consider the Su Schrieffer Heeger (SSH) model, which on the language of lattice field theory represents 1 D Wilson fermions. We employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function formalism, and calculate the chiral imbalance and electric conductivity in the presence of energy dissipation, revealing how these observables are connected to the chiral anomaly. By systematically incorporating dissipation effects into the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions manifest in both axial charge density and electric current.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable topology, Hall response, and spin-textures in bicircularly polarized light illuminated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets, featuring non-relativistic spin splitting, have drawn enormous attention due to their intriguing properties. Here, we investigate the effects of shining bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on altermagnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We discover a remarkable tunability of topology, spin-textures, and Fermi surfaces of altermagnets by means of BCL illumination, going beyond monochromatic light. We illustrate a cascade of topological phase transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes. Our findings can pave the way for effectively controlling altermagnetic materials with structured light.</description>

      <title>An Approach to the Quantum Hall Effect in Three- Dimensional Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene, where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization, we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE. For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states. Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions, highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Size Effect in Optically Active Indium Selenide Crystal Phase Heterostructures Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium selenide attracts the interest due to its outstanding electronic and optical properties which are potentially prospective in view of applications in electronic and photonic devices. Most of the polymorphic crystal phases of this semiconductor belong to the family of two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors. In this study optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy in a well-controlled manner. It is demonstrated that by changing the growth conditions one may obtain either {\gamma}-InSe, or {\gamma}-In2Se3, or \b{eta}-yIn2Se3 crystal phases. The most promising crystal phase heterostructures from the point of view of photonic applications is found to be the {\gamma}-InSe/{\gamma}-In2Se3 heterostructure. An intense optical emission from this heterostructure appears in the near infrared spectral range. The emission energy can be tuned over 250 meV by changing {\gamma}-InSe layer thickness which is explained by the quantum size effect. The optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures represent, therefore, an interesting platform for the design of light sources and detectors in the near infra-red. The use of molecular beam epitaxy for this purpose ensures that the structures are fabricated on large surfaces opening the possibility for the design of device prototypes by using lithography methods</description>

      <title>Nanoscale photonic neuron with biological signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end</description>

      <title>Resonant spin Hall effect in a nanoribbon of a spin-orbit coupled electronic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of spin Hall phenomena in a nanoribbon made of a two-dimensional square lattice with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We show that the nanoribbon can give rise to a number of additional spin degeneracy points as well as anti-crossing points, apart from the $\Gamma$ point, between two nearest sub-bands. We compute the spin Hall conductivity and demonstrate that it diverges and gives rise to a resonance when chemical potential passes through those spin-degenerate or anti-crossing points. Contrary to the previous studies, here such resonance emerges even without any external perturbation like magnetic field or light. In addition, we examine the influence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as finite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains robust. Finally, we also investigate the signature of such additional spin degeneracy and anti-crossing points in the longitudinal conductance by using retarded Green function approach in lattice model. The peculiar features of the bands are reflected in the longitudinal conductance, which takes quantized values of $2n e^{2}/{h},$ where $n$ denotes the number of bands occupied by the chemical potential with each band having spin split sub-bands.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced Moir\'e Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Magnetoresistance Beyond the Julli\`ere Model for Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecules</title>

Abstract: The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>

Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Coupling between Local and Nonlocal Modes in Landau Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings establish a pathway for engineering multimode light-matter interactions involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime.</description>

      <title>Depth Profiling of Oxygen Migration in Ta/HfO2 Stacks During Ionic Liquid Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by driving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric fields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an underlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling precise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution and voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain unknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/ SiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage and HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of ~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The resulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to 4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide thickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films. The Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This suggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen penetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping layers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally, indium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was observed, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications. These insights advance design principles for magneto-ionic and nanoionic devices requiring precise interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Unifying Anderson transitions and topological amplification in non-Hermitian chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton driven directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Magnetoelastic Wave Interactions in Magnetic Films and Heterostructures: A finite-difference approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (inverse) magnetostrictive effect in ferromagnets couples the magnetic properties to the mechanical stress, allowing for an interaction between the magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom. In this work, we present a time-integration scheme for the self-consistent simulation of coupled magnetoelastic dynamics within the framework of finite-difference micromagnetism. The proposed implementation extends the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation by a strain-induced effective field and concurrently solves the elastic equation of motion, while correctly incorporating stress and strain discontinuities at material interfaces. We then present a comprehensive set of examples, ranging from static stress configurations over material boundaries to simulations of surface acoustic wave attenuation in magnetically structured thin and thick films. These computational experiments both validate the implementation and underscore the importance of properly handling jump and boundary conditions in magnon-phonon interaction studies.</description>

Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the polar vortex motion in oxide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature-compatible iron garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy</title>

Abstract: Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (&lt; 100 nm) form the backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics, in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R) alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that 3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of 140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about 1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012 electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectric thin films under epitaxial strain exhibit a variety of vortex-like topological polarization textures. To analyze them, we build on the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire framework and extend the previously introduced soft-domain approach. This formulation provides a compact variational theoretical description of polarization morphologies in strained PbTiO$_3$ films. It yields phase diagrams as a function of temperature, strain, and thickness, and clarifies the morphological structure of emergent topological states. The method is computationally efficient and offers practical guidance for experimental studies of ferroelectric nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems. In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper models, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new order parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay of non-Hermitian topological phases under point- and line-gap conditions. Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap phases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or anti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely non-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables for all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present paper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all internal symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic magnetic molecules can be employed to manipulate charge transport in molecular nanojunctions. Charge transport through a molecular orbital connected to two leads and exchange-coupled with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field is studied here. Both the magnetic field and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin modulate the total precession frequency. The precessing molecular magnetization drives inelastic tunneling processes between electronic quasienergy levels. The dc-bias voltages allow to unveil the quasienergy levels, Larmor frequency, and the anisotropy parameter, through characteristics of charge-transport measurements involving features such as steps, peaks and dips. Quantum interference effects between states connected with spin-flip events are reflected in the shot noise as peak-dip (dip-peak) features, resembling Fano-like resonance profiles, and are controlled by the anisotropy parameter and Larmor frequency. Under zero bias, the increase of the anisotropy parameter enables the decrease of the precession frequency or alters the precession direction, and shot noise is reduced. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the anisotropy parameter to suppress the precession frequency, leading to the suppression of shot noise. The results show that in the given setup, the charge current and shot noise can be controlled by the magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin.</description>

      <title>Preparation and coherent manipulation of toroidal moments in molecules</title>

Abstract: Molecules with an odd number of electrons typically display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Single-molecule toroics -- a family of open shell lanthanide complexes -- instead display an unprecedented vanishing magnetization. The anomaly is reconciled by degenerate quantum states where electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, that carry a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic, magnonic, and photonic applications. While macroscopic toroidal moments feature in some extended systems, molecular toroidal states have yet to be observed, as it remains unclear how existing experimental set-ups could split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices. We propose a realistic pulsed radiation protocol to polarise and observe molecular toroidal moments in a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules with coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties. Three resonant MW-pulses -- delivered sequentially or simultaneously -- selectively and coherently transfers population to a long-lived toroidally-polarised state whose ensuing magneto-electric properties provide a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction revisited: imaginary-time formalism and finite temperature effects</title>

Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals provide a platform for investigating the interplay among magnetism, inversion symmetry breaking, and topologically nontrivial Weyl fermions. The Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic orders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found Heisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions. However, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this work, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the divergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at finite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in the literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength decays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance limit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to higher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing the helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>

Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

Abstract: I analyze electron transport through a Y-junction formed by helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI), focusing on the strongly interacting regime. An experimentally motivated device geometry and a spin-conserving tunneling Hamiltonian are proposed. I compute the conductance tensor and show that, for specific tunneling phases and strong repulsive interactions ($g&lt;1/2$), transport is governed by an intermediate renormalization group fixed point that interpolates between the weak- and strong-tunneling limits. These results extend previous studies of point-contact tunneling and demonstrate how interactions qualitatively modify the transport properties of multiterminal topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic phases of triangular graphene quantum
  dots (TGQDs) with zigzag edges using variational and quantum Monte
  Carlo methods. These systems serve as quantum simulators for
  bipartite lattices with broken sublattice symmetry, providing a
  platform to study the extended Hubbard model's emergent magnetic
  phenomena, including Lieb's magnetism at half-filling, edge
  depolarization upon single-electron addition, and Nagaoka
  ferromagnetism. Our non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations,
  performed for lattices of up to 61 sites, reveal that TGQDs
  transition from metallic to insulating regimes as a function of site
  radius size, while retaining edge-polarized ground states at
  half-filling. Notably, edge depolarization occurs upon
  single-electron doping in both metallic and insulating phases,
  contrasting with the Nagaoka ferromagnetism observed in hexagonal
  armchair geometries.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr_2Se_2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the N\'eel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</description>
