      <title>First Experimental Demonstration of Machine Learning-Based Tuning on the PSI Injector 2 Cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable operation of high-power proton cyclotrons is a critical requirement for Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and other large-scale applications. Beam tuning in such machines is traditionally performed manually, a process that can be slow, non-optimal, and difficult to execute in the presence of faults or changing conditions. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses. Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original article [1] can be logically divided into two parts: 1) the selection of main parameters for monochromatization and 2) interaction region optics design; the comment pertains only to the first part. The authors of [1] state that "The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of realistic IR optics designs for monochromatization at the FCC-ee". However, the proposed parameters do not seem very realistic and raise many questions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fine Structure in Channeling of Particles in Bent Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed highly efficient manipulation of the 530 MeV positron beam at Mainz Microtron via bent crystals. The low beam divergence revealed a fine structure in the angular distribution of channeled particles. A compact analytical model, supported by Monte Carlo including multiple scattering, accounts for the measurements. We established a criterion for designing a crystal with reduced angular spread of channeled particles for beam manipulation at any energy. This finding is particularly useful in view of applications of channeling to the highest energies.</description>

      <title>SynradG4: A Geant4-Based Extension for Synchrotron Radiation Background Studies in the ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate at high luminosity with multi-GeV, high-current electron beams, resulting in substantial synchrotron radiation (SR) emission in the electron storage ring (ESR). A detailed understanding of SR photon transport in the complex three-dimensional interaction region (IR) geometry is critical for estimating backgrounds in the ePIC detector and for developing effective shielding and masking strategies.
  This paper presents SynradG4, an EIC-specific extension of Geant4 designed for fast photon tracking in vacuum using established SR reflection and rough surface scattering models. SynradG4 integrates the photon reflection models of Synrad+ within the Geant4 geometry and field framework, while disabling all bulk matter interactions to achieve high-statistics transport through the 50-m-long IR vacuum system. Absorbed photon coordinates are then passed to a second-stage DD4hep simulation, where full electromagnetic processes such as photoabsorption, Compton scattering, Rayleigh scattering, and fluorescence are enabled for propagation through the beam pipe and detector materials.
  SynradG4 is not intended to replace general SR simulation codes; rather, it complements them by providing the workflow and geometry integration capabilities needed for EIC-specific background studies. Benchmark tests against Synrad+, Synrad3D, and the native Geant4 X-ray reflection model demonstrate excellent agreement for specular and diffuse reflection regimes. Using the full IR geometry and machine lattice, we present the first SR background estimates for the ePIC detector and evaluate the impact of potential SR masks.</description>
