      <title>Operators of stochastic adding machines and Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic adding machine is a Markov chain on the set of non-negative integers $\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ that models the process of adding one by successively updating the digits of a number's expansion in a given numeration system. At each step, random failures may occur, interrupting the procedure and preventing it from continuing beyond a certain point.
  The first model of such a stochastic adding machine, constructed for the binary base, was introduced by Killeen and Taylor. Their work was motivated by applications to biological clocks, aiming to model phenomena related to time discrimination and/of psychological judgment.
  From a mathematical perspective, they characterized the spectrum of the associated transition operator in terms of a filled Julia set.
  In this paper, we consider a stochastic adding machine based on a bounded Cantor numeration system and extend its definition to a continuous state space--namely, the closure of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ with respect to the topology induced by the Cantor numeration system. This stochastic process naturally induces a transition operator $S$ acting on the Banach space of continuous complex-valued functions over the continuous state space, as well as a fibered filled Julia set $\mathcal{E}$.
  Our main result describes the spectrum of $S$ in terms of the fibered filled Julia set $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, if the stochastic adding machines halts with probability one after a finite number of steps, then the spectrum of $S$ coincides with $\mathcal{E}$; otherwise, the spectrum coincides with the boundary $\partial \mathcal{E}$.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation from periodic solutions of central force problems in the three-dimensional space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with electromagnetic perturbations of a central force problem of the form \begin{equation*} \dfrac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \bigl( \varphi(\dot{x}) \bigr) = V'(|x|) \dfrac{x}{|x|} + E_{\varepsilon}(t,x)+\dot{x} \wedge B_{\varepsilon}(t,x), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \{0\}, \end{equation*} where $V \colon (0,+\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function, $E_\varepsilon$ and $B_\varepsilon$ are respectively the electric field and the magnetic field, smooth and periodic in time, $\varepsilon\in\mathbb{R}$ is a small parameter. The considered differential operator includes, as special cases, the classical one, $\varphi(v)=mv$, as well as that of special relativity, $\varphi(v) = mv/\sqrt{1-\vert v \vert^2/c^2}$. We investigate whether non-circular periodic solutions of the unperturbed problem (i.e., with $\varepsilon=0$) can be continued into periodic solutions for $\varepsilon\neq0$ small, both for the fixed-period problem and, if the perturbation is time-independent, for the fixed-energy problem. The proof is based on an abstract bifurcation theorem of variational nature, which is applied to suitable Hamiltonian action functionals. In checking the required non-degeneracy conditions we take advantage of the existence of partial action-angle coordinates as provided by the Mishchenko--Fomenko theorem for superintegrable systems. Physically relevant problems to which our results can be applied are homogeneous central force problems in classical mechanics and the Kepler problem in special relativity.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on stochastic converse Lyapunov theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Cucker-Smale Networks: Limiting Laplacian Time-Varying Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differences in opinion can be seen as distances between individuals, and such differences do not always vanish over time. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework that captures the formation of opinion clusters, based on extensions of the Cucker Smale and Hegselmann Krause models to a combined adaptive (or co-evolutionary) network. Reducing our model to a singular limit of fast adaptation, we mathematically analyze the asymptotic behavior of the resulting Laplacian dynamics over various classes of temporal graphs and use these results to explain the behavior of the original proposed adaptive model for fast adaptation. In particular, our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing linear consensus models over time-varying networks that naturally arise as singular limits in many adaptive network models.</description>

      <title>Mapping correlations and coherence: adjacency-based approach to data visualization and regularity discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations, by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new computational approaches to regularity discovery.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden correlations from complex spatial distributions: Adjacent Correlation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry of Spencer-Hodge Decompositions in Constrained Geometric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the interaction mechanism between metric structures and mirror transformations in Spencer complexes of compatible pairs. Our core contribution is the establishment of mirror symmetry for Spencer-Hodge decomposition theory, solving the key technical problem of analyzing the behavior of metric geometry under sign transformations. Through precise operator difference analysis, we prove that the perturbation $\mathcal{R}^k = -2(-1)^k \omega \otimes \delta^{\lambda}_{\mathfrak{g}}(s)$ induced by the mirror transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$ is a bounded compact operator, and apply Fredholm theory to establish the mirror invariance of harmonic space dimensions $\dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,\lambda} = \dim \mathcal{H}^k_{D,-\lambda}$. We further prove the complete invariance of constraint strength metrics and curvature geometric metrics under mirror transformations, thus ensuring the spectral structure stability of Spencer-Hodge Laplacians. From a physical geometric perspective, our results reveal that sign transformations of constraint forces do not affect the essential topological structure of constraint systems, embodying deep symmetry principles in constraint geometry. This work connects Spencer metric theory with mirror symmetry theory, laying the foundation for further development of constraint geometric analysis and computational methods.</description>

      <title>Cancer model with moving extinction threshold reproduces real cancer data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple dynamic model of cancer development that captures carcinogenesis and subsequent cancer progression. A central idea of the model is to include the immune system as an extinction threshold, similar to the strong Allee effect in population biology. We first identify the limitations of commonly used Allee effect models in reproducing typical cancer progression. We then address these limitations by deriving a new model that incorporates: (i) random mutations of stem cells at a rate that increases with age and (ii) immune response whose strength may also vary over time.
  Our model accurately reproduces a wide range of real-world cancer data: the typical age-specific cumulative risk of most human cancers, the progression of breast cancer in mice, and the unusual age-specific cumulative risk of breast cancer in women. In the last case, we use a moving extinction threshold to reflect the different immune response at different phases of the menstrual cycle and menopausal treatment. This provides new insights into the effects of hormone replacement therapy and menstrual cycle length. This moving threshold approach can be applied to a variety of other cancer scenarios where the immune response or other important factors may vary over time.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rotationally invariant polynomial root sets under iterated differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate to an $N$-sample of a given rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, a polynomial $P_N$ with roots given by the sample. Then, for $t \in (0,1)$, we consider the empirical measure $\mu_t^{N}$ associated to the root set of the $\lfloor t N\rfloor$-th derivative of $P_N$.
  A question posed by O'Rourke and Steinerberger \cite{o2021nonlocal}, reformulated as a conjecture by Hoskins and Kabluchko \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, and recently reaffirmed by Campbell, O'Rourke and Renfrew \cite{campbell2024fractional}, states that under suitable conditions of regularity on $\mu_0$, for an i.i.d. sample,
  $\mu_t^{N}$ converges to a rotationally invariant probability measure $\mu_t$ when $N$ tends to infinity, and that $(1-t)\mu_t$ has a radial density
  $x \mapsto \psi(x,t)$ satisfying the following partial differential equation:
  \begin{equation} \label{PDErotational}
  \frac{ \partial \psi(x,t) }{\partial t} = \frac{ \partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{ \psi(x,t) }{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \psi(y,t) dy } \right),
  \end{equation} In \cite{hoskins2021dynamics}, this equation is reformulated as an equation on the distribution function $\Psi_t$ of the radial part of $(1-t) \mu_t$: \begin{equation} \label{equationPsixtabstract} \frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial t} = x \frac{\frac{\partial \Psi_t (x)}{\partial x} } {\Psi_t(x)} - 1. \end{equation} Restricting our study to a specific family of $N$-samplings, we are able to prove a variant of the conjecture above. We also emphasize the important differences between the two-dimensional setting and the one-dimensional setting, illustrated in our Theorem \ref{monotonicity}.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that $(M,\mathfrak{g})$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with strictly negative sectional curvatures. A subset of conjugacy classes $E \subset \text{conj}(\pi_1(M))$ is called spectrally rigid if when two negatively curved Riemannian metrics $\mathfrak{g}_1, \mathfrak{g}_2$ on $M$ have the same marked length spectrum on $E$, then their marked length spectra coincide everywhere. In this work we show that there are arbitrarily sparse spectrally rigid sets and that they exist, in some sense, in every direction in $\pi_1(M)$.</description>

      <title>The Influence of the Memory Capacity of Neural DDEs on the Universal Approximation Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $\tau&gt;0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds.</description>

      <title>Minimal model program for algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties, we prove the base-point-freeness theorem, the contraction theorem, and the existence of flips. The first result resolves a conjecture of Cascini and Spicer, while the latter two results strengthen a result of Cascini and Spicer by removing their assumption on the termination of flips.
  Moreover, we prove the existence of the minimal model program for lc algebraically integrable foliations on klt varieties and the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces for lc algebraically integrable foliations polarized by ample divisors on klt varieties. As a consequence, we show that $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial klt varieties with lc algebraically integrable Fano foliation structures are Mori dream spaces. We also show the existence of a Shokurov-type polytope for lc algebraically integrable foliations.</description>

Abstract: Denote by $\mathbf{\mu}$ the maximal entropy measure for the shift map $\sigma$ acting on $\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, by $L$ the associated Ruelle operator and by $K = L^{\dagger}$ the Koopman operator, both acting on $\mathscr{L}^2(\mathbf{\mu})$. The Ruelle-Koopman pair can determine a generalized boson system in the sense of \cite{Kuo}. Here $2^{-\frac{1}{2}} K$ plays the role of the creation operator and $ 2^{-\frac{1}{2}} L$ is the annihilation operator. We show that $[L,K]$ is the projection on the kernel of $L.$ In $C^*$-algebras the Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ represents derivative. Akin to this point of view we introduce a dynamically defined Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}$ associated with the Ruelle-Koopman pair and a representation $\pi$. Given a continuous function $f$, denote by $M_f$ the operator $ g \to M_f(g)=f\, g.$ Among other dynamical relations we get $$\|\left[ \mathcal{D} , \pi (M_f) \right]\| = \sup_{x \in \Omega} \sqrt{\frac{|f(x) - f(0x)|^{2}}{2} + \frac{|f(x) - f(1x)|^2}{2}} = \left|\sqrt{L |K f - f|^{2}}\right|_{\infty}$$ which concerns a form of discrete-time mean backward derivative. We also derive an inequality for the discrete-time forward derivative $f \circ \sigma -f$: $$ |f \circ \sigma -f |_{\infty} = |K f - f|_{\infty} \geq \|\left[ \mathcal{D} , \pi (M_f) \right]\| \geq |f - L f|_{\infty}.$$ Moreover, we get $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(K L)\right] \,\|=1$. The Number operator is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}K \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} L.$ The Connes distance requires to ask when an operator $A$ satisfies the inequality $\|\, \left[\mathcal{D} ,\pi(A)\right] \,\|\leq 1$; the Lipschtiz constant of $A$ smaller than $1$.</description>
