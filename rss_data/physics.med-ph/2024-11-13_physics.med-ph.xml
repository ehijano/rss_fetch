      <title>Synergistic PET/CT Reconstruction Using a Joint Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose in this work a framework for synergistic positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) reconstruction using a joint generative model as a penalty. We use a synergistic penalty function that promotes PET/CT pairs that are likely to occur together. The synergistic penalty function is based on a generative model, namely $\beta$-variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE). The model generates a PET/CT image pair from the same latent variable which contains the information that is shared between the two modalities. This sharing of inter-modal information can help reduce noise during reconstruction. Our result shows that our method was able to utilize the information between two modalities. The proposed method was able to outperform individually reconstructed images of PET (i.e., by maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM)) and CT (i.e., by weighted least squares (WLS)) in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Future work will focus on optimizing the parameters of the $\beta$-VAE network and further exploration of other generative network models.</description>

      <title>A Discrete Fiber Dispersion Model with Octahedral Symmetry Quadrature for Applications in Skin Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced simulations of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues frequently rely on structure-based constitutive models, including smeared descriptions of collagen fibers. Among them, the so-called Discrete Fiber Dispersion (DFD) model is based on a discrete integration of the fiber-strain energy over all the fiber directions. In this paper, we recall the theoretical framework of the DFD model, including a derivation of the stress and stiffness tensors required for the finite element implementation. Specifically, their expressions for incompressible plane stress problems are obtained. The use of a Lebedev quadrature, built exploiting the octahedral symmetry, is then proposed, illustrating the particular choice adopted for the orientation of the integration points. Next, the convergence of this quadrature scheme is assessed by means of three numerical benchmark tests, highlighting the advantages with respect to other angular integration methods available in the literature. Finally, we propose as applicative example a simulation of Z-plasty, a technique commonly used in reconstructive skin surgery, considering multiple geometrical configurations and orientations of the fibers. Results are provided in terms of key mechanical quantities relevant for the surgical practice.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Parallel Imaging System for Very-low Field (50mT) MRI Scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the scanning time of very-low field (VLF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, commonly employed for stroke diagnosis, can enhance patient comfort and operational efficiency. The conventional parallel imaging (PI) technique for high-field MRI should be tailored to apply here, considering the differences in the direction of the main magnetic field and the presence of noise. A VLF-specific PI algorithm and phased-array coil are proposed, marking the first application of PI in VLF MRI. Reconstruction quality is enhanced by denoising undersampled k-space data using a linear-prediction based Kalman filter. Subsequently, the denoised k-space data are nonlinearly mapped from the original space onto a high-dimensional feature space, utilizing a polynomial feature mapping defined nonlinear frame. Frame parameters are calculated using auto-calibration signals (ACS) from the center k-space, and missing phase-encoding lines in the original space are estimated using acquired lines in the feature space. An 8-channel phased-array coil, designed for a vertical main magnetic field, is decoupled using geometric overlap and a low input impedance (LII) preamplifier. Healthy volunteer head imaging experiments using the proposed PI technique exhibit the lowest mean-squared-error (MSE) value and the highest peak-signal-to-noise (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) values compared to two widely used PI methods. The proposed PI technique enables the VLF MRI scanner to achieve similar image quality and a 72.5% improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to fully sampled images while requiring less than 50% of the scan time. We present a PI technique tailored for VLF MRI scanner for the first time, along with potential research direction to achieve greater reduction factor.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Geant4-DNA and RITRACKS/RITCARD: microdosimetry, nanodosimetry and DNA break predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at investigating the impact of DNA geometry, compaction and calculation chain on DNA break and chromosome aberration predictions for high charge and energy (HZE) ions, using the Monte Carlo codes Geant4-DNA, RITRACKS and RITCARD. To ensure consistency of ion transport of both codes, we first compared microdosimetry and nanodosimetry spectra for different ions of interest in hadrontherapy and space research. The Rudd model was used for the transport of ions in both models. Developments were made in Geant4 (v11.2) to include periodic boundary conditions (PBC) to account for electron equilibrium in small targets. Excellent agreements were found for both microdosimetric and nanodosimetric spectra for all ion types, with and without PBC. Some discrepancies remain for low-energy deposition events, likely due to differences in electron interaction models. The latest results obtained using the newly available Geant4 example ``dsbandrepair'' will be presented and compared to DNA break predictions obtained with RITCARD.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Learning for Microbubble Localization in Super-Resolution Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.</description>

      <title>Towards Seamless Integration of Magnetic Tracking into Fluoroscopy-guided Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2D projective nature of X-ray radiography presents significant limitations in fluoroscopy-guided interventions, particularly the loss of depth perception and prolonged radiation exposure. Integrating magnetic trackers into these workflows is promising; however, it remains challenging and under-explored in current research and practice. To address this, we employed a radiolucent magnetic field generator (FG) prototype as a foundational step towards seamless magnetic tracking (MT) integration. A two-layer FG mounting frame was designed for compatibility with various C-arm X-ray systems, ensuring smooth installation and optimal tracking accuracy. To overcome technical challenges, including accurate C-arm pose estimation, robust fluoro-CT registration, and 3D navigation, we proposed the incorporation of external aluminum fiducials without disrupting conventional workflows. Experimental evaluation showed no clinically significant impact of the aluminum fiducials and the C-arm on MT accuracy. Our fluoro-CT registration demonstrated high accuracy (mean projection distance approxiamtely 0.7 mm, robustness (wide capture range), and generalizability across local and public datasets. In a phantom targeting experiment, needle insertion error was between 2 mm and 3 mm, with real-time guidance using enhanced 2D and 3D navigation. Overall, our results demonstrated the efficacy and clinical applicability of the MT-assisted approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate a radiolucent FG into a fluoroscopy-guided workflow.</description>

      <title>A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Radiotherapy: Leveraging the Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Ensuring the precision in motion tracking for MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is crucial for the delivery of effective treatments. This study refined the motion tracking accuracy in MRIgRT through the innovation of an automatic real-time tracking method, leveraging an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework coupled with automatic segmentation. Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking method by integrating two primary methods: the ETLD framework and an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The TLD framework was upgraded to suit real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. Additionally, ICV was combined for precise coverage of the target volume, which refined the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. Tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases, our method ensures precise tracking and accurate segmentation vital for MRIgRT. Results: An evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions revealed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects, underscoring the robustness and efficacy of the ETLD. Moreover, the ETLD+ICV yielded a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the proposed method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusions: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time motion tracking method for MRIgRT that markedly surpasses current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also demonstrates enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, positioning it as an indispensable asset in the quest to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.</description>

      <title>A fast plastic scintillator for low intensity proton beam monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of particle therapy monitoring, we are developing a gamma-ray detector to determine the ion range in vivo from the measurement of particle time-of-flight. For this application, a beam monitor capable to tag in time the incident ion with a time resolution below 235 ps FWHM (100 ps rms) is required to provide a start signal for the acquisition. We have therefore developed a dedicated detector based on a fast organic scintillator (EJ-204) of 25x25x1 mm3 coupled to four SiPM strips that allow measuring the particle incident position by scintillation light sharing. The prototype was characterised with single protons of energies between 63 and 225 MeV at the MEDICYC and ProteusONE facilities of the Antoine Lacassagne proton therapy centre in Nice. We obtained a time resolution of 120 ps FWHM at 63 MeV, and a spatial resolution of ~2 mm rms for single particles. Two identical detectors also allowed to measure the MEDICYC proton energy with 0.3% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Isometric Transformations for Image Augmentation in Mueller Matrix Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mueller matrix polarimetry captures essential information about polarized light interactions with a sample, presenting unique challenges for data augmentation in deep learning due to its distinct structure. While augmentations are an effective and affordable way to enhance dataset diversity and reduce overfitting, standard transformations like rotations and flips do not preserve the polarization properties in Mueller matrix images. To this end, we introduce a versatile simulation framework that applies physically consistent rotations and flips to Mueller matrices, tailored to maintain polarization fidelity. Our experimental results across multiple datasets reveal that conventional augmentations can lead to misleading results when applied to polarimetric data, underscoring the necessity of our physics-based approach. In our experiments, we first compare our polarization-specific augmentations against real-world captures to validate their physical consistency. We then apply these augmentations in a semantic segmentation task, achieving substantial improvements in model generalization and performance. This study underscores the necessity of physics-informed data augmentation for polarimetric imaging in deep learning (DL), paving the way for broader adoption and more robust applications across diverse research in the field. In particular, our framework unlocks the potential of DL models for polarimetric datasets with limited sample sizes. Our code implementation is available at github.com/hahnec/polar_augment.</description>
