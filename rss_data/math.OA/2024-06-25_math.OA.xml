      <title>Fuglede-Kadison determinants of matrix-valued semicircular elements and capacity estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the Fuglede-Kadison determinant of arbitrary matrix-valued semicircular operators in terms of the capacity of the corresponding covariance mapping. We also improve a lower bound by Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Widgerson on this capacity, by making it dimension-independent.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of operator systems: tight extensions and noncommutative measurable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a unital $C^*$-algebra generated by some separable operator system $S$. More than a decade ago, Arveson conjectured that $S$ is hyperrigid in $A$ if all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$. Recently, a counterexample to the conjecture was found by Bilich and Dor-On. To circumvent the difficulties hidden in this counterexample, we exploit some of Pedersen's seminal ideas on noncommutative measurable structures and establish an amended version of Arveson's conjecture. More precisely, we show that all irreducible representations of $A$ are boundary representations for $S$ precisely when all representations of $A$ admit a unique "tight" completely positive extension from $S$. In addition, we prove an equivalence between uniqueness of such tight extensions and rigidity of completely positive approximations for representations of nuclear $C^*$-algebras, thereby extending the classical principle of Korovkin--Saskin for commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>Coactions of compact groups on $M_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every coaction of a compact group on a finite-dimensional $C^*$-algebra is associated with a Fell bundle. Every coaction of a compact group on a matrix algebra is implemented by a unitary operator. A coaction of a compact group on $M_n$ is inner if and only if its fixed-point algebra has an abelian $C^*$-subalgebra of dimension $n$. Investigating the existence of effective ergodic coactions on $M_n$ reveals that $\operatorname{SO}(3)$ has them, while $\operatorname{SU}(2)$ does not. We give explicit examples of the two smallest finite nonabelian groups having effective ergodic coactions on $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Partial Isometries Between Hilbert Modules and Their Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by questions raised in the preprint [AL20] by Accardi and Lu (private communication), we examine criteria for when the product of two partial isometries between Hilbert spaces is again a partial isometry and we use this to define a new composition operation that always yields again a partial isometry. Then, we aim at promoting these results to (not necessarily adjointable) partial isometries between Hilbert modules as proposed by Shalit and Skeide [SS23].
  The case of Hilbert spaces is elementary and rather simple, though not trivial, but -- we expect -- folkloric. The case of Hilbert modules suffers substantially from the fact that bounded right linear maps need not possess necessarily an adjoint. In fact, we show that the new composition law for partial isometries between Hilbert spaces can in no way be promoted directly to partial isometries between Hilbert modules, but that we have to pass to the more flexible class of partially defined isometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum spheres as graph C*-algebras: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we discuss the description of Vaksman-Soibelman quantum spheres using graph C*-algebras, following the seminal work of Hong and Szyma\'nski. We give a slightly different proof of the isomorphism with a graph C*-algebra, borrowing the idea of Mikkelsen and Kaad of using conditional expectations to prove the desired result.</description>
