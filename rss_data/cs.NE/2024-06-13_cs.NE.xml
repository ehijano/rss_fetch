      <title>Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating quay-crane dual-cycling with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising one-dimensional and two-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Statistical validation through a two-tailed paired t-test confirms the superiority of QCDC-DR-GA at a 5% significance level. The approach effectively combines QCDC optimization with dockyard rehandle minimization, optimizing the total unloading-loading time. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance than QCDC-DR-GA. This emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously considering both aspects for optimal resource utilization and overall operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Next Era of Multi-objective Optimization: Large Language Models as Architects of Evolutionary Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) are prevalent in various real-world applications, necessitating sophisticated solutions that balance conflicting objectives. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while effective, often rely on domain-specific expert knowledge and iterative tuning, which can impede innovation when encountering novel MOPs. Very recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized software engineering by enabling the autonomous development and refinement of programs. Capitalizing on this advancement, we propose a new LLM-based framework for evolving EA operators, designed to address a wide array of MOPs. This framework facilitates the production of EA operators without the extensive demands for expert intervention, thereby streamlining the design process. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we have conducted extensive empirical studies across various categories of MOPs. The results demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of our LLM-evolved operators.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning an Evolvable Developmental Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representations for black-box optimisation methods (such as evolutionary algorithms) are traditionally constructed using a delicate manual process. This is in contrast to the representation that maps DNAs to phenotypes in biological organisms, which is at the hear of biological complexity and evolvability. Additionally, the core of this process is fundamentally the same across nearly all forms of life, reflecting their shared evolutionary origin. Generative models have shown promise in being learnable representations for black-box optimisation but they are not per se designed to be easily searchable. Here we present a system that can meta-learn such representation by directly optimising for a representation's ability to generate quality-diversity. In more detail, we show our meta-learning approach can find one Neural Cellular Automata, in which cells can attend to different parts of a "DNA" string genome during development, enabling it to grow different solvable 2D maze structures. We show that the evolved genotype-to-phenotype mappings become more and more evolvable, not only resulting in a faster search but also increasing the quality and diversity of grown artefacts.</description>

      <title>CGP++ : A Modern C++ Implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reference implementation of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) was written in the C programming language. C inherently follows a procedural programming paradigm, which entails challenges in providing a reusable and scalable implementation model for complex structures and methods. Moreover, due to the limiting factors of C, the reference implementation of CGP does not provide a generic framework and is therefore restricted to a set of predefined evaluation types. Besides the reference implementation, we also observe that other existing implementations are limited with respect to the features provided. In this work, we therefore propose the first version of a modern C++ implementation of CGP that pursues object-oriented design and generic programming paradigm to provide an efficient implementation model that can facilitate the discovery of new problem domains and the implementation of complex advanced methods that have been proposed for CGP over time. With the proposal of our new implementation, we aim to generally promote interpretability, accessibility and reproducibility in the field of CGP.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-based Prompt Evolution Engineering Design Optimization With Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering design optimization requires an efficient combination of a 3D shape representation, an optimization algorithm, and a design performance evaluation method, which is often computationally expensive. We present a prompt evolution design optimization (PEDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model for penalizing impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolutionary search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20\% in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.</description>

      <title>Bridging Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning: A Comprehensive Survey on Hybrid Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL), which integrates Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for optimization, has demonstrated remarkable performance advancements. By fusing both approaches, ERL has emerged as a promising research direction. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the diverse research branches in ERL. Specifically, we systematically summarize recent advancements in related algorithms and identify three primary research directions: EA-assisted Optimization of RL, RL-assisted Optimization of EA, and synergistic optimization of EA and RL. Following that, we conduct an in-depth analysis of each research direction, organizing multiple research branches. We elucidate the problems that each branch aims to tackle and how the integration of EAs and RL addresses these challenges. In conclusion, we discuss potential challenges and prospective future research directions across various research directions. To facilitate researchers in delving into ERL, we organize the algorithms and codes involved on https://github.com/yeshenpy/Awesome-Evolutionary-Reinforcement-Learning.</description>

      <title>Evolve Cost-aware Acquisition Functions Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization scenarios involve expensive evaluation with unknown and heterogeneous costs. Cost-aware Bayesian optimization stands out as a prominent solution in addressing these challenges. To approach the global optimum within a limited budget in a cost-efficient manner, the design of cost-aware acquisition functions (AFs) becomes a crucial step. However, traditional manual design paradigm typically requires extensive domain knowledge and involves a labor-intensive trial-and-error process. This paper introduces EvolCAF, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) to automatically design cost-aware AFs. Leveraging the crossover and mutation in the algorithmic space, EvolCAF offers a novel design paradigm, significantly reduces the reliance on domain expertise and model training. The designed cost-aware AF maximizes the utilization of available information from historical data, surrogate models and budget details. It introduces novel ideas not previously explored in the existing literature on acquisition function design, allowing for clear interpretations to provide insights into its behavior and decision-making process. In comparison to the well-known EIpu and EI-cool methods designed by human experts, our approach showcases remarkable efficiency and generalization across various tasks, including 12 synthetic problems and 3 real-world hyperparameter tuning test sets.</description>

      <title>Time Elastic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</description>
