      <title>Elastic moduli of blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals with low chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new theoretical approach has been developed to describe the elastic properties of cubic blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals (LCs). Blue phases are three-dimensional periodic chiral liquids with local anisotropy of the average orientation of molecules, and due to their periodicity, they have lattice elastic moduli characteristic of ordinary crystalline solids. The rigid tensor approximation, which works well at low chirality parameter ($\kappa\ll1$), was used to calculate the elastic moduli of the experimentally observed blue phases $O^8$ (BPI) and $O^2$ (BPII). It is shown that in the one-constant approximation for Frank moduli of LCs ($K_{11}=K_{22}=K_{33}$), the cubic lattice of blue phases has isotropic elasticity, and the Lam\'e's first parameter $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ are equal to zero. It is found that the sign of the Poisson's ratio is determined by the ratio of elastic moduli $K_0/K_1$; in particular, when $K_0&gt;K_1$, the Poisson's ratio is negative.</description>

      <title>Chocolate suspensions as a model for jamming and nonlinear rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rheology of dark chocolate pastes in both industrially relevant pre-refined form and simplified model systems. Steady and oscillatory shear experiments reveal yielding, pronounced shear-thinning, and stress-dependent hysteresis governed by solid loading. Fitting the viscosity data with the Maron-Pierce model provides stress-dependent maximum flowable fractions $\phi_{\rm{m}}(\sigma)$, defining yield loci in the $(\phi, \sigma)$ plane. Their variation with stress quantifies the coupled roles of friction and adhesion in setting flow limits. Large-amplitude oscillatory shear tests characterize transitions from elastic to viscous behavior and identify distinct recovery pathways near jamming. Contact-stress decomposition separates hydrodynamic and frictional contributions, confirming that adhesive contact networks dominate stress transmission in pre-refined pastes. These results establish chocolate pastes as dense, adhesive suspensions whose flow is controlled by the interplay of friction and adhesion, offering quantitative benchmarks for constitutive modeling and linking chocolate processing to the broader physics of constraint rheology.</description>

      <title>Tracer Diffusion in Granular Suspensions: Testing the Enskog Kinetic Theory with DSMC and Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusion of an intruder in a granular gas, with both components modeled as smooth hard spheres, both immersed in a low viscosity carrier fluid to form a particle-laden suspension. In this system, dissipative particle collisions coexist with the action of a solvent. The latter is modeled via a viscous drag force and a stochastic Langevin-like force proportional to the background fluid temperature. Building on previous kinetic theory and random-walk results of the tracer diffusion coefficient [R. G\'omez Gonz\'alez, E. Abad, S. Bravo Yuste, and V. Garz\'o, Phys. Rev. E \textbf{108}, 024903 (2023)], where random-walk predictions were compared with Chapman--Enskog results up to the second Sonine approximation, we assess the robustness of the Enskog framework by incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, using direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results as an intermediate reference. In particular, we focus on the intruder velocity autocorrelation function, considering intruders different masses (from 0.01 to 100 times the mass of the granular particles), and analyse the behavior of the intruder temperature and diffusion coefficient. Our results clarify the influence of the friction parameter and the conditions under which Enskog kinetic theory reliably describes intruder diffusion in granular suspensions.</description>

      <title>Probing and modeling cell-cell communication in 2D biomimetic tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tissues, cells in direct physical contact with each other can exchange ions or molecules via protein clusters called gap junctions that form channels across the membranes of adjacent cells. Here, we use a simplified biomimetic approach, coupled with theoretical modeling, to unravel the physical mechanisms controlling such transport. Tissues are mimicked with 2D hexagonal networks of monodisperse aqueous droplets connected by lipid membranes called Droplet Interface Bilayers (DIBs), decorated with $\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$HL) transmembrane proteins forming nanopores through heptamerization in the membrane. The diffusion of calcein across 2D DIB networks is thoroughly studied using epifluorescence microscopy at various $\alpha$HL concentrations. The results are successfully confronted with a Continuous Time Random Walk model in hexagonal networks, with an average waiting time increasing nonlinearly with the concentration of pore monomers.</description>

      <title>Swimming patterns of a multi-mode bacterial swimmer in fluid shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial swimming is well characterized in uniform liquids at rest. The natural habitat of bacterial swimmers, however, is often dominated by moving fluids and interfaces, resulting in shear flows that may strongly alter bacterial navigation strategies. Here, we study how fluid shear flow affects the swimming motility of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, a bacterial swimmer that moves in a versatile pattern composed of three different swimming modes, where the flagella may push, pull, or wrap around the cell body (multi-mode swimmer). We introduce a computer automated cell tracking and swimming mode detection tool to show that shear induced alignment depends on the swimming mode, while motility and proximity to surfaces counteract the alignment effect. Moreover, filament wrapping becomes less efficient with increasing shear stress. Numerical simulations of realistic swimmer geometries complement our experimental results, providing more detailed mechanistic insights into movement patterns of bacterial swimmers in a shear flow.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of emulsions with matter supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a theory for the kinetics of emulsions in which a continuous supply of matter feeds droplet growth. We consider cases where growth is either limited by bulk diffusion or the transport through the droplets' interfaces. Our theory extends the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory by two types of matter supply, where either the supersaturation is maintained or the supply rate is constant. In emulsions with maintained supersaturation, we find a decoupling of droplets at all times, with the droplet size distribution narrowing in the diffusion-limited regime and a drifting distribution of a fixed shape in the interface-resistance-limited case. In emulsions with a constant matter supply, there is a transition between narrowing and broadening in the diffusion-limited regime, and the distribution is non-universal. For the interface-resistance-limited regime, there is no transition to narrowing, and we find a universal law governing coarsening kinetics that is valid for any constant matter supply. The average radius evolves according to a power law that is independent of the matter supply, and we find a closed-form expression for the droplet size distribution function. Our theory is relevant to biological systems, such as biomolecular condensates in living cells, since droplet material is not conserved and the growth of small droplets is proposed to be interface-resistance-limited.</description>

      <title>Identification of 2D colloidal assemblies in images: a threshold processing method versus machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of identification of colloidal assemblies using the example of two-dimensional coatings (monolayer assemblies). Colloidal systems are used in various fields of science and technology, for example, in applications for photonics and functional coatings. The physical properties depend on the morphology of the structure of the colloidal assemblies. Therefore, effective identification of particle assemblies is of interest. The following classification is considered here: isolated particles, dimers, chains and clusters. We have studied and compared two identification methods: image threshold analysis using the OpenCV library and machine learning using the YOLOv8 model as an example. The features and current results of training a neural network model on a dataset specially prepared for this work are described. A comparative characteristic of both methods is given. The best result was shown by the machine learning method (97% accuracy). The threshold processing method showed an accuracy of about 68%. The developed algorithms and software modules may be useful to scientists and engineers working in the field of materials science in the future.</description>

      <title>Cell Competition Driven by Secreted Ligands: Modeling Liver Metastasis of Colorectal Cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell competition in multicellular organisms has been shown to play a critical role during the development of organisms, cancer progression, and in the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Various mechanisms of cell competition have been identified, including active elimination via mechanical forces or induced apoptosis, as well as competition for nutrients and other beneficial factors. A recent experiment demonstrated hallmarks of cell competition, associated with cell cycle dynamics, between liver progenitor cells and colorectal cancer cells [Krotenberg Garcia et al., iScience 27, 109718 (2024)]. However, a mechanistic explanation for this form of competition remains lacking. Here, we present a mean-field model of competition for signaling ligands, coupled with cell cycle dynamics, to provide such an understanding. Our model captures the salient features of the experiment, including population dynamics and cell cycle variations. We demonstrate that secretion of a beneficial factor by cells, coupled with the enhanced uptake efficiency of cancer cells, suffices to reproduce the experimental outcome. Our model, reminiscent of competition for secreted growth factors, provides insight into the minimal level of complexity required to achieve the observed competitive outcome as well as its link to cell cycle dynamics. It can also serve as a general framework for studying biological populations with growth-stage-dependent competition over consumer-produced products.</description>

      <title>Faradaic and capacitive charging of an electrolyte-filled pore in response to a small applied potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrochemical devices often charge both through Faradaic reactions and electric double layer formation. Here, we study these coupled processes in a model system of a long electrolyte-filled pore subject to a small suddenly-applied potential, close to the equilibrium potential $\Psi^\text{eq}$ at which there is no net Faradaic charge transfer. Specifically, we solve the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equations by asymptotic approximations, using the pore's small inverse aspect ratio as the small parameter. In the early-time limit, the reaction-diffusion equations yield an extended Faradaic transmission line model that includes a voltage source, $\Psi_\text{eq}$, biasing the Faradaic reactions, captured by the resistance $R_F$. In the long-time limit, the model exhibits a nontrivial potential of zero charge, $\Psi_\text{pzc} = \Psi_\text{eq}[1 - \hat{Z}(0)/R_F]$, where $\hat{Z}(0)$ is the experimentally accessible zero-frequency impedance of the system. This expression provides a new means to experimentally measure the Faradaic contribution to $\Psi_\text{pzc}$.</description>

      <title>Integral fractional viscoelastic models in SPH: LAOS simulations versus experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rheological behaviour of a polymer was investigated by performing numerical simulations in complex flow and comparing them to experiments. For our simulations, we employed a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics scheme, utilizing an integral fractional model based on the K-BKZ framework. The results are compared with experiments performed on melt-state isotactic polypropylene under medium and large amplitude oscillatory shear.
  The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the model is able to capture and predict both the linear and the non-linear viscoelastic behaviours of the polymer melt. Results show that equipping SPH with an integral fractional model is promising approach for the simulation of complex polymeric materials under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Multivalent linkers mediated ultra-sensitive bio-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biosensing and diagnostic applications, a key objective is to design detection systems capable of identifying targets at very low concentrations, i.e., achieving high sensitivity. Here, we propose a linker-mediated detection scheme in which the presence of target molecules (linkers) facilitates the adsorption of ligand-coated guest nanoparticles onto a receptor-coated host substrate. Through a combination of computer simulations and mean-field theory, we demonstrate that, at fixed overall binding strength, increasing the valency of linkers exponentially lowers the concentration threshold for detection. This enables the identification of targets at extremely low concentrations, which is critical for early-stage disease and pathogen diagnostics. Furthermore, superselectivity with respect to binding strength is preserved for multivalent linkers, allowing for effective discrimination between targets and non-targets. Our findings highlight multivalency engineering of linkers as a powerful strategy to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of biodetection systems.</description>

      <title>Surface-induced ordering and continuous breaking of translational symmetry in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface-induced liquid crystalline phase transitions evoke fundamental interest and can provide deeper insight into the nature of low-dimensional phase transitions. Board-like conjugated polymers are particularly interesting because they exhibit novel sanidic liquid crystalline mesophases that remain largely unexplored. Specifically, although preferential molecular orientation near the free surface has been observed in films of conjugated polymers, the mechanism of its formation remains unclear. Here, we use grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to monitor the formation and breaking of positional order in situ in thin films of two conjugated polymers representative of two classes: polythiophenes and polydiketopyrrolopyrroles. Our results reveal that the surface induces positional order in films of both conjugated polymers through the formation of a highly oriented, sanidic disordered mesophase at the surface. This ordering process continues upon cooling and undergoes multiple liquid crystalline transitions into more ordered phases, both at the surface and in the bulk, which can compete with each other. The positional smectic-like order parameter exhibits continuous temperature dependence near the transition, signifying a continuous breaking of translational symmetry by the surface. Theoretical analysis enables us to accurately describe the order parameter when critical behavior is considered.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By examining rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensates through the perspective of large spin, we identify a novel type of topological point defects in the magnetization texture. These defects are not predicted by conventional homotopy analysis but rather by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The magnetization texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice contains doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects, where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure describes an unconventional "unvortex" lattice, which contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity is concentrated exclusively within defect points. Numerical results are presented, confirming these predictions and demonstrating their persistence in smaller-spin condensates.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>
