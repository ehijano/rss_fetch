      <title>Hurwitz space components; and the Coleman-Oort Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hurwitz spaces are moduli of isotopy classes of covers. A specific space is formed from a finite group G and C, r of its conjugacy classes and an equivalence relation \dagger. Components, interpret as a braid orbits on Nielsen classes.
  Fried-V\"olklein 1991 related absolute (corresponding to a permutation representation, T, of G) and inner equivalence classes. It noted two situations producing multiple components:
  #1. The action of a normalizer subgroup from $T$ on components; and
  #2. distinct components from the Schur multiplier of $G$ (the Fried-Serre lift invariant).
  Here we consider components of type #1 and #2 under one umbrella using a definition in G.~Gonz\'alez-D\'iez and W.J. Harvey, 1992 to generalize this paper and A. Ghigi and C. Tamborini, 2025.
  Our applications use Modular Towers to generalize Serre's Open Image Theorem. That distinguishes two types of decomposition groups -- designated GL_2 and CM -- that occur on towers of modular curves. Our generalization -- with mild constraints -- for any pair (G,C), generalizes modular curve towers to Modular Towers uses arithmetic properties of Jacobian varieties, the lift invariant, the shift-incidence pairing on cusps of reduced Hurwitz spaces to connect Hilbert's Irreducibility theorem to the Coleman-Oort conjecture.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of Meissner's Optimal Bound on the Degree of a Poincar\'e Multiplier and an Improved Optimal Degree Multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a monic univariate polynomial. We say that $f$ is positive if $f(x)$ is positive over all $x &gt; 0$. If all the coefficients of $f$ are non-negative, then $f$ is trivially positive. In 1883, Poincar\'e proved that $f$ is positive if and only if there exists a monic polynomial $g$ such that all the coefficients of $gf$ are non-negative. Such polynomial $g$ is called a Poincar\'e multiplier for the positive polynomial $f$. Of course one hopes to find a multiplier with smallest degree. In 1911, Meissner provided such a bound for quadratic polynomials. In this paper, we provide a linear algebra proof of Meissner's optimal bound and compare an improved optimal degree Poincar\'e multiplier to one provided by Meissner.</description>

      <title>Parke-Taylor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parke-Taylor functions are certain rational functions on the Grassmannian of lines encoding MHV amplitudes in particle physics. For $n$ particles there are $n!$ Parke-Taylor functions, corresponding to all orderings of the particles. Linear relations between these functions have been extensively studied in the last years. We here describe all non-linear polynomial relations between these functions in a simple combinatorial way and study the variety parametrized by them, called the Parke-Taylor variety. We show that the Parke-Taylor variety is linearly isomorphic to the log canonical embedding of the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$ due to Keel and Tevelev, and that the intersection with the algebraic torus recovers the open part, $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. We give an explicit description of this isomorphism. Unlike the log canonical embedding, this Parke-Taylor embedding respects the symmetry of the $n$ marked points and is constructed in a single-step procedure, avoiding the intermediate embedding into a product of projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Brauer group of moduli stack of parabolic $\textnormal{PSp}(r,\mathbb{C})$--bundles over a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Take an irreducible smooth complex projective curve $X$ of genus $g$, with $g\,\geq\, 3$. Let $r$ be an even positive integer. We prove that the Brauer group of the moduli stack of stable parabolic $\textnormal{PSp}(r,\mathbb{C})$--bundles on $X$, of full-flag parabolic data along a set of marked points on $X$, coincides with the Brauer group of the smooth locus of the corresponding coarse moduli space of stable parabolic $\textnormal{PSp}(r,\mathbb{C})$--bundles. Under certain conditions on the parabolic types, we also compute the Brauer group of the smooth locus of this coarse moduli space. Similar computations are also done for the case of partial flags.</description>

      <title>Rank 3 Quadratic Generators of Veronese Embeddings: The Characteristic 3 Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates property QR(3) for Veronese embeddings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $3$. We determine the rank index of $(\mathbb{P}^n , \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n} (d))$ for all $n \geq 2$, $d \geq 3$, proving that it equals $3$ in these cases. Our approach adapts the inductive framework of [HLMP 2021], re-proving key lemmas for characteristic $3$ to establish quadratic generation by rank $3$ forms. We further compute the codimension of the span of rank $3$ quadrics in the space of quadratic equations of the second Veronese embedding, showing it grows as ${n+1 \choose 4}$. This provides a clear explanation of the exceptional behavior exhibited by the second Veronese embedding in characteristic $3$. Additionally, we show that for a general complete intersection of quadrics $X \subset \mathbb{P}^r$ of dimension at least $3$, the rank index of $(X,\mathcal{O}_X (2))$ is $4$, thereby confirming the optimality of our main bound. These results complete the classification of the rank index for Veronese embeddings when ${\rm char}(\mathbb{K}) \ne 2$.</description>

      <title>A transcendental non-Archimedean Calabi--Yau Theorem with applications to the cscK problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold and $\alpha$ a K\"ahler class on $X$. We prove that if $(X,\alpha)$ is uniformly K-stable for models, then there is a unique cscK metric in $\alpha$. This was first proved in the algebraic case by Chi Li, and it strengthens a related result in an article of Mesquita-Piccione. K-stability for models is defined in terms of big test configurations, but we also give a valuative criterion as in the work of Boucksom--Jonsson together with an explicit formula for the associated $\beta$-invariant. To accomplish this we further develop the non-Archimedean pluripotential theory in the transcendental setting, as initiated in the works of Darvas--Xia--Zhang and Mesquita-Piccione. In particular we prove the continuity of envelopes and orthogonality properties, and using that, we are able to extend the non-Archimedean Calabi-Yau Theorem found in an article of Boucksom--Jonsson to the general K\"ahler setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steenrod algebra can not be realised as an enveloping of any Lie superalgebra. We list several problems that suggest a need to modify the definition of the enveloping algebra, for example, to get rid of certain strange deformations which we qualify as an artefact of the inadequate definition of the enveloping algebra in positive characteristic. P. Deligne appended our paper with his comments, hints and open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up of a previous work in which we show that, for a $3$-edge connected tropical curve $\Gamma$, the existence of a divisor of degree $3$ and Baker-Norine rank at least $1$ in $\Gamma$ is equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate harmonic morphism of degree $3$ from a tropical modification of $\Gamma$ to a tropical rational curve. In this work, we extend this result to a tropical curve with lower edge connectivity which does not contain a cycle of (at least three) separating vertices (a so-called necklace).</description>

      <title>Cohomological invariants of $\mathscr{M}_{3,n}$ via level structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that mod $2$ cohomological invariants of the moduli stack $\mathscr{M}_{3,n}$ of smooth pointed curves of genus three contain a free module with generators in degree $0$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$, formed by the invariants of the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}_6(2)$. We achieve this by showing that the torsor of full level two structures $\mathscr{M}_{3,n}(2) \to \mathscr{M}_{3,n}$ is versal. Along the way, we prove that the invariants of the stack of del Pezzo surfaces of degree two contain the invariants of the Weyl group $W(\mathsf{E}_7)$ and that the mod $2$ cohomology of $\mathscr{M}_{3,n}$ is non-zero in degree three. Our main result holds also for the stack $\mathscr{A}_3$ of principally polarized abelian threefolds.</description>

      <title>Stable sheaf cohomology and Koszul--Ringel duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a close relationship between stable sheaf cohomology for polynomial functors applied to the cotangent bundle on projective space, and Koszul--Ringel duality on the category of strict polynomial functors as described in the work of Cha\l upnik, Krause, and Touz\'e. Combining this with recent results of Maliakas--Stergiopoulou we confirm a conjectured periodicity statement for stable cohomology. In a different direction, we find a remarkable invariance property for $\Ext$ groups between Schur functors associated to hook partitions, and compute all such extension groups over a field of arbitrary characteristic. We show that this is further equivalent to the calculation of $\Ext$ groups for partitions with $2$ rows (or $2$ columns), and as such it relates to Parker's recursive description of $\Ext$ groups for $\SL_2$-representations. Finally, we give a general sharp bound for the interval of degrees where stable cohomology of a Schur functor can be non-zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of the topological vertex was originally proposed by Aganagic, Klemm, Mari\~no and Vafa as a means to calculate open Gromov-Witten invariants of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. In this paper, we place the topological vertex within the context of relative Gromov-Witten invariants of log Calabi-Yau manifolds and describe how these invariants can be effectively computed via a gluing formula for the enumeration of tropical curves in a singular integral affine space. This richer context allows us to prove that the topological vertex possesses certain tropical symmetries. These symmetries are captured by the action of a quantum torus Lie algebra that is related to a quantisation of the Lie algebra of the tropical vertex group of Gross, Pandharipande and Siebert. Finally, we demonstrate how this algebra of symmetries leads to an explicit description of the topological vertex and related Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Brauer group of the generic diagonal surface of arbitrary degree is trivial. The same method is applied to surfaces whose equation can be written as the sum of two bilinear forms. This uses a general criterion for the triviality of the transcendental Brauer group of an isotrivial variety. We determine the field of definition of the geometric Picard group of the Fermat surface of arbitrary degree, thus finishing work of Shioda and Aoki.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions on free abelian quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00815v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study slope-stable vector bundles and Bridgeland stability conditions on varieties which are a quotient of a smooth projective variety by a finite abelian group $G$ acting freely. We show there is an analytic isomorphism between $G$-invariant geometric stability conditions on the cover and geometric stability conditions on the quotient that are invariant under the residual action of the group $\widehat{G}$ of irreducible representations of $G$. We apply our results to describe a connected component inside the stability manifolds of free abelian quotients when the cover has finite Albanese morphism. This applies to varieties with non-finite Albanese morphism which are free abelian quotients of varieties with finite Albanese morphism, such as Beauville-type and bielliptic surfaces. This gives a partial answer to a question raised by Lie Fu, Chunyi Li, and Xiaolei Zhao: if a variety $X$ has non-finite Albanese morphism, does there always exist a non-geometric stability condition on $X$? We also give counterexamples to a conjecture of Fu--Li--Zhao concerning the Le Potier function, which characterises Chern classes of slope-semistable sheaves. As a result of independent interest, we give a description of the set of geometric stability conditions on an arbitrary surface in terms of a refinement of the Le Potier function. This generalises a result of Fu--Li--Zhao from Picard rank $1$ to arbitrary Picard rank.</description>

      <title>Regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a complex semisimple linear algebraic group. Fix a subset $\Theta$ of simple roots. Given a lower ideal $I$ in positive roots, one can define the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$ in the full flag variety $G/B$. For a $\Theta$-ideal $I$ (which is a special lower ideal), we can define the regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ in the partial flag variety $G/P$. In this manuscript we first provide a summand formula and a product formula for the Poincar\'e polynomial of regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. It is a well-known result from Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand that the cohomology ring of the partial flag variety $G/P$ is isomorphic to the invariants in the cohomology ring of the full flag variety $G/B$ under an action of the parabolic Weyl group $W_\Theta$ generated by $\Theta$. We generalize this result to regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg varieties. More concretely, we give an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ and the $W_\Theta$-invariant subring of the cohomology ring of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,I)$. Furthermore, we provide a description of the cohomology ring for a regular nilpotent partial Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}_\Theta(N,I)$ in terms of the $W_\Theta$-invariants in the logarithmic derivation module of the ideal arrangement $\mathcal{A}_I$, which is a generalization of the result by Abe-Masuda-Murai-Sato with the author.</description>

      <title>Liftings of ideals in positive characteristic to those in characteristic zero : Low dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove the finiteness of the set of minimal log discrepancies for a fixed exponent if the dimension is
  less than or equal to three.
  We also prove that the set of log canonical thresholds (lct for short) of ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic
  is contained in the set of lct's of ideals on a smooth variety over C, assuming the dimension is less than or
  equal to three. Under the same dimension assumption, it follows that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational. Our proofs also show the same statements for the higher dimensional case if all such pairs admit log resolutions by a composite of blow-ups by smooth centers.</description>

      <title>Constant case of the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let D be a DVR of mixed characteristic. Let G be a reductive D-group scheme. Then the Grothendieck-Serre conjecture is true for the D-group scheme G and any geometrically regular local D-algebra R. Also we prove a version of Lindel-Ojanguren-Gabber's geometric presentation lemma in the DVR context.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory. I. Component lattices of stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, where we develop a new framework for enumerative geometry that allows the generalization of constructions and results from linear moduli stacks to general non-linear algebraic stacks.
  In this paper, we introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack. This is a key object in our theory, defined using the formalism of stacks of graded and filtered points. It provides the combinatorial data needed to formulate various results in enumerative geometry, such as decomposition-type theorems and wall-crossing formulae. Later papers in the series will focus on extending Donaldson-Thomas theory to the non-linear case, and we expect that our approach will be useful for extending many other flavours of enumerative invariants beyond the linear case as well.
  This paper proves several foundational results of our framework. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within chambers in the component lattice. The second is the finiteness theorem, which provides a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks.
  We also discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</description>

      <title>Classifying torsors of tori with Brauer groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Mackey functors, we provide a general framework for classifying torsors of algebraic tori in terms of Brauer groups of finite field extensions of the base field. This generalizes Blunk's description of the tori associated to del Pezzo surfaces of degree 6 to all retract rational tori, essentially the largest class for which this is possible.</description>
