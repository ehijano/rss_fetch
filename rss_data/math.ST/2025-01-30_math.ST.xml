      <title>Fundamental Computational Limits in Pursuing Invariant Causal Prediction and Invariance-Guided Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pursuing invariant prediction from heterogeneous environments opens the door to learning causality in a purely data-driven way and has several applications in causal discovery and robust transfer learning. However, existing methods such as ICP [Peters et al., 2016] and EILLS [Fan et al., 2024] that can attain sample-efficient estimation are based on exponential time algorithms. In this paper, we show that such a problem is intrinsically hard in computation: the decision problem, testing whether a non-trivial prediction-invariant solution exists across two environments, is NP-hard even for the linear causal relationship. In the world where P$\neq$NP, our results imply that the estimation error rate can be arbitrarily slow using any computationally efficient algorithm. This suggests that pursuing causality is fundamentally harder than detecting associations when no prior assumption is pre-offered.
  Given there is almost no hope of computational improvement under the worst case, this paper proposes a method capable of attaining both computationally and statistically efficient estimation under additional conditions. Furthermore, our estimator is a distributionally robust estimator with an ellipse-shaped uncertain set where more uncertainty is placed on spurious directions than invariant directions, resulting in a smooth interpolation between the most predictive solution and the causal solution by varying the invariance hyper-parameter. Non-asymptotic results and empirical applications support the claim.</description>

      <title>Sobol-CPI: a Doubly Robust Conditional Permutation Importance Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional Permutation Importance (CPI) has been recently introduced for Variable Importance analysis with good empirical results. In this work, we first provide theoretical guarantees for CPI. We establish a double robustness property to detect null covariates, making it a suitable model for variable selection. We then present a modified and still computationally efficient version, Sobol-CPI, that aims to estimate a well-known variable importance measure, the Total Sobol Index (TSI). We prove that it is nonparametrically efficient, and we provide a procedure to control the type-I error. Through numerical experiments, we show that Sobol-CPI preserves the double robustness property in practice.</description>

      <title>Likelihood landscape of binary latent model on a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimization landscape of maximum likelihood estimation for a binary latent tree model with hidden variables at internal nodes and observed variables at the leaves. This model, known as the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model in statistical phylogenetics, is also a special case of the ferromagnetic Ising model. While the likelihood function is known to be non-concave with multiple critical points in general, gradient descent-type optimization methods have proven surprisingly effective in practice. We provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by analyzing the population likelihood landscape in a neighborhood of the true parameter vector. Under some conditions on the edge parameters, we show that the expected log-likelihood is strongly concave and smooth in a box around the true parameter whose size is independent of both the tree topology and number of leaves. The key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the expected Hessian, showing that its diagonal entries are large while its off-diagonal entries decay exponentially in the graph distance between the corresponding edges. These results provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence for the effectiveness of optimization methods in this setting and may suggest broader principles for understanding optimization in latent variable models on trees.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of non-parametric statistical inference for integrated quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general non-parametric statistical inference theory for integrals of quantiles without assuming any specific sampling design or dependence structure. Technical considerations are accompanied by examples and discussions, including those pertaining to the bias of empirical estimators. To illustrate how the general results can be adapted to specific situations, we derive - at a stroke and under minimal conditions - consistency and asymptotic normality of the empirical tail-value-at-risk, Lorenz and Gini curves at any probability level in the case of the simple random sampling, thus facilitating a comparison of our results with what is already known in the literature. Notes and references concerning underlying technicalities in the case of dependent (i.e., time series) data are offered. As a by-product, our general results provide new and unified proofs of large-sample properties of a number of classical statistical estimators, such as trimmed means, and give additional insights into the origins of, and the reasons for, various necessary and sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Copula methods for modeling pair densities in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach towards approximating the density-to-pair-density map based on copula theory from statistics. We extend the copula theory to multi-dimensional marginals, and deduce that one can describe any (exact or approximate) pair density by the single-particle density and a copula. We present analytical formulas for the exact copula in scaling limits, numerically compute the copula for dissociating systems with two to four particles in one dimension, and propose accurate approximations of the copula between equilibrium and dissociation for two-particle systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless Network Topology Inference: A Markov Chains Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of inferring the topology of a wireless network using limited observational data. Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.</description>

      <title>Negative Moment Bounds for Sample Autocovariance Matrices of Stationary Processes Driven by Conditional Heteroscedastic Errors and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a negative moment bound for the sample autocovariance matrix of a stationary process driven by conditional heteroscedastic errors. This moment bound enables us to asymptotically express the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the least squares predictor as the sum of three terms related to model complexity, model misspecification, and conditional heteroscedasticity. A direct application of this expression is the development of a model selection criterion that can asymptotically identify the best (in the sense of MSPE) subset AR model in the presence of misspecification and conditional heteroscedasticity. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Interference Among First-Price Pacing Equilibria: A Bias and Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online A/B testing is widely used in the internet industry to inform decisions on new feature roll-outs. For online marketplaces (such as advertising markets), standard approaches to A/B testing may lead to biased results when buyers operate under a budget constraint, as budget consumption in one arm of the experiment impacts performance of the other arm. To counteract this interference, one can use a budget-split design where the budget constraint operates on a per-arm basis and each arm receives an equal fraction of the budget, leading to ``budget-controlled A/B testing.'' Despite clear advantages of budget-controlled A/B testing, performance degrades when budget are split too small, limiting the overall throughput of such systems. In this paper, we propose a parallel budget-controlled A/B testing design where we use market segmentation to identify submarkets in the larger market, and we run parallel experiments on each submarket.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel budget-controlled A/B test design with submarkets in a large online marketplace environment. Second, we formally define market interference in first-price auction markets using the first price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) framework. Third, we propose a debiased surrogate that eliminates the first-order bias of FPPE, drawing upon the principles of sensitivity analysis in mathematical programs. Fourth, we derive a plug-in estimator for the surrogate and establish its asymptotic normality. Fifth, we provide an estimation procedure for submarket parallel budget-controlled A/B tests. Finally, we present numerical examples on semi-synthetic data, confirming that the debiasing technique achieves the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <title>Tree P\'olya Splitting distributions for multivariate count data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new class of multivariate distributions adapted for count data, called Tree P\'olya Splitting. This class results from the combination of a univariate distribution and singular multivariate distributions along a fixed partition tree. Known distributions, including the Dirichlet-multinomial, the generalized Dirichlet-multinomial and the Dirichlet-tree multinomial, are particular cases within this class. As we will demonstrate, these distributions are flexible, allowing for the modeling of complex dependence structures (positive, negative, or null) at the observation level. Specifically, we present the theoretical properties of Tree P\'olya Splitting distributions by focusing primarily on marginal distributions, factorial moments, and dependence structures (covariance and correlations). A dataset of abundance of Trichoptera is used, on one hand, as a benchmark to illustrate the theoretical properties developed in this article, and on the other hand, to demonstrate the interest of these types of models, notably by comparing them to other approaches for fitting multivariate data, such as the Poisson-lognormal model in ecology or singular multivariate distributions used in microbiome.</description>

      <title>Positive Semidefinite Matrix Supermartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic convergence and nonasymptotic maximal inequalities of supermartingales and backward submartingales in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. These are natural matrix analogs of scalar nonnegative supermartingales and backward nonnegative submartingales, whose convergence and maximal inequalities are the theoretical foundations for a wide and ever-growing body of results in statistics, econometrics, and theoretical computer science.
  Our results lead to new concentration inequalities for either martingale dependent or exchangeable random symmetric matrices under a variety of tail conditions, encompassing now-standard Chernoff bounds to self-normalized heavy-tailed settings. Further, these inequalities are usually expressed in the Loewner order, are sometimes valid simultaneously for all sample sizes or at an arbitrary data-dependent stopping time, and can often be tightened via an external randomization factor.</description>

      <title>A Unified Representation of Density-Power-Based Divergences Reducible to M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-power-based divergences are known to provide robust inference procedures against outliers, and their extensions have been widely studied. A characteristic of successful divergences is that the estimation problem can be reduced to M-estimation. In this paper, we define a norm-based Bregman density power divergence (NB-DPD) -- density-power-based divergence with functional flexibility within the framework of Bregman divergences that can be reduced to M-estimation. We show that, by specifying the function $\phi_\gamma$, NB-DPD reduces to well-known divergences, such as the density power divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence. Furthermore, by examining the combinations of functions $\phi_\gamma$ corresponding to existing divergences, we show that a new divergence connecting these existing divergences can be derived. Finally, we show that the redescending property, one of the key indicators of robustness, holds only for the $\gamma$-divergence.</description>
