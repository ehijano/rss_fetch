      <title>Bitangents to symmetric quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recall that a non-singular planar quartic is a canonically embedded non-hyperelliptic curve of genus three. We say such a curve is symmetric if it admits non-trivial automorphisms. The classification of (necessarily finite) groups appearing as automorphism groups of non-singular curves of genus three dates back to the last decade of the 19th century. As these groups act on the quartic via projective linear transformations, they induce symmetries on the 28 bitangents. Given such an automorphism group $G=\mathrm{Aut}(C)$, we prove the $G$-orbits of the bitangents are independent of the choice of $C$, and we compute them for all twelve types of smooth symmetric planar quartic curves. We further observe that techniques deriving from equivariant homotopy theory directly reveal patterns which are not obvious from a classical moduli perspective.</description>

      <title>Monodromy in the space of symmetric cubic surfaces with a line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the enumerative problem of finding lines on cubic surfaces defined by symmetric polynomials. We prove that the moduli space of symmetric cubic surfaces is an arithmetic quotient of the complex hyperbolic line, and determine constraints on the monodromy group of lines on symmetric cubic surfaces arising from Hodge theory and geometry of the associated cover. This interestingly fails to pin down the entire Galois group. Leveraging computations in equivariant line geometry and homotopy continuation, we prove that the Galois group is the Klein 4-group. This is the first computation in what promises to be an interesting direction of research: studying monodromy in classical enumerative problems restricted by a finite group of symmetries.</description>

      <title>The tempered disk and the tempered cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a "spectrum" to each ind-Banach algebra). In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open sets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analog to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence). As a dividend of such a theory, one can also introduce a variant of the classical convergent rigid cohomology for a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V): the tempered cohomology. In this setting, the rigid analytic tube of radius 1 is replaced by a "tempered one". We finally compare our tempered cohomology with some other classical cohomology theories.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of decomposable Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we give explicit constructions of decomposable hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties over fields of characteristic $0$. These include hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties that are isogenous to a product of two absolutely simple hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties, a square of a hyperelliptic Jacobian variety, and a product of four hyperelliptic Jacobian varieties three of which are of the same dimension. As an application, we produce families of hyperelliptic curves with infinitely many quadratic twists having at least two rational non-Weierstrass points; and families of quadruples of hyperelliptic curves together with infinitely many square-free $d$ such that the quadratic twists of each of the curves by $d$ possess at least one rational non-Weierstrass point.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Multiplicative Affine Springer Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce parabolic multiplicative affine Springer fibers, which resemble the admissible union of affine Deligne Lusztig varieties in the affine flag variety. We also study their global counterparts called parabolic multiplicative Hitchin fibers. Their associated fibration is a global analogue of the Grothendieck simultaneous resolution for monoids. Using this fibration, we show that the parabolic multiplicative affine Springer fibers are equidimensional and find their dimension.</description>

      <title>The small $p$-adic Simpson correspondence in the semi-stable reduction case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize several known results on small Simpson correspondence for smooth formal schemes over $\calO_C$ to the case for semi-stable formal schemes. More precisely, for a liftable semi-stable formal scheme $\frakX$ over $\calO_C$ with generic fiber $X$, we establish (1) an equivalence between the category of Hitchin-small integral $v$-bundles on $X_{v}$ and the category of Hitchin-small Higgs bundles on $\frakX_{\et}$, generalizing the previous work of Min--Wang, and (2) an equivalence between the moduli stack of $v$-bundles on $X_{v}$ and the moduli stack of rational Higgs bundles on $\frakX_{\et}$ (equivalently, moduli stack of Higgs bundles on $X_{\et}$), generalizing the previous work of Ansch\"utz--Heuer--Le Bras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a reformulation of the Dubrovin conjecture about the semisimplicity of quantum cohomology in terms of the so-called second structure connection of quantum cohomology. The key ingredient in our work is the notion of a twisted reflection vector which allows us to give an elegant description of the monodromy data of the quantum connection in terms of the monodromy data of its Laplace transform.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of mixed Hodge modules using generalized V-filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study generalized $V$-filtrations, defined by Sabbah, on $\mathcal D$-modules underlying mixed Hodge modules on $X\times \mathbf A^r$. Using cyclic covers, we compare these filtrations to the usual $V$-filtration, which is better understood. The main result shows that these filtrations can be used to compute $\sigma^!$, where $\sigma \colon X \times \{0\} \to X \times \mathbf A^r$ is the inclusion of the zero section.
  As an application, we use the restriction result to study singularities of complete intersection subvarieties. These filtrations can be used to study the local cohomology mixed Hodge module. In particular, we classify when weighted homogeneous isolated complete intersection singularities in $\mathbf A^n$ are $k$-Du Bois and $k$-rational.</description>

      <title>Remarks on $p$-primary torsion of the Brauer group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth and proper variety $X$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$, the group $Br(X)[p^\infty]$ is a direct sum of finitely many copies of $\mathbb{Q}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p$ and an abelian group of finite exponent. The latter is an extension of a finite group $J$ by the group of $k$-points of a connected commutative unipotent algebraic group $U$. In this paper we show that (1) if $X$ is ordinary, then $U = 0$; (2) if $X$ is a surface, then $J$ is the Pontryagin dual of $NS(X)[p^\infty]$; (3) if $X$ is an abelian variety, then $J = 0$. Using Crew's formula, we compute $Br(X)[p^\infty]$ for Enriques surfaces and abelian $3$-folds. Generalizing a result of Ogus, we give a criterion for the injectivity of the canonical map from flat to crystalline cohomology in degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Groupoids derived from the simple elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K. Saito's classification of simple elliptic singularities includes three families of weighted homogeneous singularities: $ \tilde{E}_{6}, \tilde{E}_7$, and $ \tilde{E}_8 $. For each family, the isomorphism classes can be distinguished by K. Saito's $j$-functions. By applying the Mather-Yau theorem, which states that the isomorphism class of an isolated hypersurface singularity is completely determined by its $k$-th moduli algebra, M. Eastwood demonstrated explicitly that one can directly recover K. Saito's $j$-functions from the zeroth moduli algebras. This research aims to generalize M. Eastwood's result through meticulous computation of the groupoids associated with simple elliptic singularities. We not only directly retrieve K. Saito's $j$-functions from the $k$-th moduli algebras but also elucidate the automorphism structure within the $k$-th moduli algebras. We derive the automorphisms using the methodology of the $k$-th Yau algebra and establish a Torelli-type theorem for the $\tilde{E}_7 $-family when $k=1$. In contrast, we find that the Torelli-type theorem is inapplicable for the first Yau algebra in the $ \tilde{E}_6 $-family. By considering the first Yau algebra as a module rather than solely as a Lie algebra, we can impose constraints on the coefficients of the transformation matrices, which facilitates a straightforward identification of all isomorphisms. Our new approach also provides a simple verification of the result by Chen, Seeley, and Yau concerning the zeroth moduli algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let S be the Cox ring of a product of r projective spaces. In this paper, we study the Cartwright-Sturmfels Hilbert schemes of S, which are multigraded Hilbert schemes that only parametrize radical ideals. Our main result shows that these Hilbert schemes are always smooth and irreducible if the Picard rank r is at most 2. This result can be seen as a multigraded analogue of the famous theorems of Fogarty and Maclagan-Smith, where the Picard rank replaces the dimension of the ambient space.</description>

      <title>Polymatroid Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "matroid Schubert variety". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
  We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modelled by a "polymatroid Schubert variety".
  Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on matroid Schubert varieties; however, the geometry of polymatroid Schubert varieties is noticeably more complicated than that of matroid Schubert varieties. Many natural questions remain open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any smooth projective curve embeds into $\mathbb{P}^3$. More generally, any curve embeds into a rationally connected variety of dimension at least three. We prove conversely that if every curve embeds in a threefold $X$, then $X$ is rationally connected. In particular "all curves embed" is a birational property for threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the category of ind-coherent sheaves on a quasi-smooth scheme is naturally tensored over the category of sheared D-modules on its shifted cotangent bundle, commuting with its natural action of categorified Hoschschild cochains. We prove that it defines a Morita equivalence as such. We then extend these results to quasi-smooth Artin stacks.
  As a consequence of our formalism, we are able to articulate a precise sense in which the space of unramified automorphic functions over a function field localizes over the stack of arithmetic Arthur parameters.</description>

Abstract: Let $\sigma_i$ be the braid actions on infinite Grassmannian cluster algebras induced from Fraser's braid group actions. Let $\mathsf{T}_i$ be the braid group actions on (quantum) Grothendieck rings of Hernandez-Leclerc category ${\mathscr C}_\mathfrak{g}^0$ of affine type $A_n^{(1)}$, and $\mathsf{R}_i$ the braid group actions on the corresponding extended crystals. In the paper, we prove that the actions $\sigma_i$ coincide with the braid group actions $\mathsf{T}_i$ and $\mathsf{R}_i$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between points of momentum amplituhedra and origami crease patterns. As an application, we prove that the BCFW cells triangulate the momentum amplituhedron when all Mandelstam variables are nonnegative. As another application, we show that every weighted planar bipartite graph $\Gamma$ admits a t-embedding, i.e., an embedding of the planar dual of $\Gamma$ such that the sum of angles of white (equivalently, black) faces around each vertex is equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Theta linkage maps and a generic entailment for GSp$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of mod $p$ weight shifting differential operators on the Siegel threefold. We coin the term theta linkage maps to refer to some operators between automorphic vector bundles with linked weights, which can be thought of as generalizations of the classical theta cycle. In particular there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. As an application we produce a generic entailment of Serre weights, i.e. a Hecke eigenform with a generic Serre weight in the lowest alcove also has a Serre weight in one of the upper alcoves. We also prove a partial result towards finding a lowest alcove Serre weight for a particular non-ordinary Fontaine-Laffaille $\overline{\rho}$, in the spirit of Faltings-Jordan and Tilouine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build connections between K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers, i.e., complete (possibly non-compact) shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons, and algebraic geometry. In particular, we (1). prove that a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker is naturally a quasi-projective variety, using birational algebraic geometry; (2). formulate a conjecture relating the existence of K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and K-stability of polarized Fano fibrations, which unifies and extends the YTD type conjectures for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone metrics and compact K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers; (3). formulate conjectures connecting tangent flows at singularities of K\"ahler-Ricci flows and algebraic geometry, via a 2-step degeneration for the weighted volume of a Fano fibration.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra of rank $N$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Associated to $\mathcal{L}$ is a family of polynomial folding maps $$\textsf{F}_{n}:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N\quad\text{for}\quad n\ge1$$ having the property that $\textsf{F}_{n}$ has topological degree $n^N$ and $$\textsf{F}_{m}\circ\textsf{F}_{n}=\textsf{F}_{n}\circ\textsf{F}_{m}\quad\text{for all}\quad m,n\ge1.$$ We derive formulas for the leading terms of the folding maps on $\mathbb{A}^2$ associated to the Lie algebras $\mathcal{A}_2$, $\mathcal{B}_2$, and $\mathcal{G}_2$, and we use these formulas to compute the affine automorphism group of each folding map.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, and let $\mathcal{X}$ be a proper regular flat scheme over $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ with a generic fiber $X$ geometrically connected over $K$. We prove that there is an exact sequence up to finite groups $0\rightarrow Sha(Pic_{X/K}^0)\rightarrow Br(\mathcal{X})\rightarrow Br(X_{\bar{K}})^{G_K}\rightarrow 0$, which generalizes a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for arithmetic surfaces to arbitrary dimensions. Consequently, we reduce Artin's question regarding the finiteness of $Br(\mathcal{X})$ for proper regular flat schemes $\mathcal{X}$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ to $3$-dimensional arithmetic schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.11747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polypols are natural generalizations of polytopes, with boundaries given by nonlinear algebraic hypersurfaces. We describe polypols in the plane and in 3-space that admit a unique adjoint hypersurface and study them from an algebro-geometric perspective. We relate planar polypols to positive geometries introduced originally in particle physics, and identify the adjoint curve of a planar polypol with the numerator of the canonical differential form associated with the positive geometry. We settle several cases of a conjecture by Wachspress claiming that the adjoint curve of a regular planar polypol does not intersect its interior. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of the real topology of the adjoint curve for arbitrary convex polygons. Finally, we determine all types of planar polypols such that the rational map sending a polypol to its adjoint is finite, and explore connections of our topic with algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements Satisfy (un)Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems, Applications to $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reduced hyperplane arrangement we prove the analytic Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, subject to mild combinatorial arithmetic conditions on the weights defining the twist. This gives a quasi-isomorphism between the twisted logarithmic de Rham complex and the twisted meromorphic de Rham complex. The latter computes the cohomology of the arrangement's complement with coefficients from the corresponding rank one local system. We also prove the algebraic variant (when the arrangement is central), and the analytic and algebraic (untwisted) Logarithmic Comparison Theorems. The last item positively resolves an old conjecture of Terao. We also prove that: every nontrivial rank one local system on the complement can be computed via these Twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorems; these computations are explicit finite dimensional linear algebra. Finally, we give some $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-module applications: for example, we give a sharp restriction on the codimension one components of the multivariate Bernstein--Sato ideal attached to an arbitrary factorization of an arrangement. The bound corresponds to (and, in the univariate case, gives an independent proof of) M. Saito's result that the roots of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a non-smooth, central, reduced arrangement live in $(-2 + 1/d, 0).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.13882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a normalizer of the diagonal torus $T_1\cong \mathbb{G}_m$ in $\text{SL}_2$. We prove localization theorems for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N^n$ for equivariant cohomology with coefficients in the (twisted) Witt sheaf, along the lines of the classical Atiyah-Bott localization theorems for equivariant cohomology for a torus action. We also have an analog of the Bott residue formula for $\text{SL}_2^n$ and $N$. In the case of an $\text{SL}_2^n$-action, there is a rather serious restriction on the orbit type. For an $N$-action, there is no restriction for the localization result, but for the Bott residue theorem, one requires a certain type of decomposition of the fixed points for the $T_1$-action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08233v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete the proof of the Nisnevich conjecture in equal characteristic: for a smooth algebraic variety $X$ over a field $k$, a $k$-smooth divisor $D \subset X$, and a reductive $X$-group $G$ whose base change $G_D$ is totally isotropic, we show that each generically trivial $G$-torsor on $X\setminus D$ trivializes Zariski semilocally on $X$. In mixed characteristic, we show the same when $k$ is a replaced by a discrete valuation ring $O$, the divisor $D$ is the closed $O$-fiber of $X$, and either $G$ is quasi-split or $G$ is only defined over $X \setminus D$ but descends to a quasi-split group over $\mathrm{Frac}(O)$ (a Kisin-Pappas type variant). Our arguments combine Gabber-Quillen style presentation lemmas with excision and reembedding d\'{e}vissages to reduce to analyzing generically trivial torsors over a relative affine line. As a byproduct of this analysis, we give a new proof for the Bass-Quillen conjecture for reductive group torsors over $\mathbb{A}^d_R$ in equal characteristic.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a certain two-parameter family of plane-embeddings of Edwards elliptic curve $E_a: x^2+y^2=a^2(1+x^2y^2)$ is introduced to provide explicitly computed tropical curves corresponding to degeneration in $a\to 1$. Applying the theta uniformization of $E_a$ with the method of ultradiscretization by Kajiwara-Kaneko-Nobe-Tsuda, we give a formula for the coordinate functions that traces the cycle part of the tropical elliptic curve. We also illustrate how one can recover the whole part of the tropical curve as a quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree after Speyer's algebraic approach in smooth cases.</description>

As a corollary, we show that the strong Sarkisov Program holds in dimension 4. Additionally, we prove the weak Sarkisov program with decreasing (augmented) Sarkisov degree. Finally, using the theory of syzygies of Mori fibre spaces, we obtain a directed diagram that encodes all the information of the strong Sarkisov Program.</description>

Abstract: In this note, without the assumption of resolution of singularities, we prove an equivalence between the category of motives with modulus in positive characteristic with rational coefficient $\MDM^\eff(k,\Q)$ and Voevodsky's category of motives $\DM^\eff(k,\Q)$, which has been philosophically predicted from the beginning in the study of motives with modulus.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimensional Brill-Noether Loci and Moduli for Very Ample Line Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Brill-Noether loci for higher dimensional varieties. Let $M$ be a moduli space of coherent sheaves on $X$. The Brill-Noether loci of $M$ are the closed subsets $\{\mathcal{F} \in M : h^0(X,\mathcal{F}) \geq k+1\}$. When $X$ is a smooth curve and $M = \textbf{Pic}_X^d$, the space of degree $d$ line bundles on $X$, the Brill-Noether loci have a natural determinantal scheme structure coming from a map of vector bundles on $\textbf{Pic}_X^d$, which is the main tool in studying their geometry. In [CMR10], the authors generalize this to the case where $X$ is any variety and $M$ is the moduli space of stable vector bundles on $X$ with fixed invariants but require that $H^i(X,E) = 0$ for all $E \in M$ and $i \geq 2$. We generalize these results by showing how to give a natural determinantal scheme structure to the Brill-Noether loci for any $X$ and any $M$. In doing so we develop the theory of Fitting ideals for a complex which can be used to define natural scheme structures in other cases as well, such as the locus of points where the projective dimension of a coherent sheaf jumps up. As an application of our results, we construct moduli spaces for very ample line bundles on a variety.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Finite Braid Group Orbits on $SL_2(\C)$-Character Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze finite orbits of the natural braid group action on the character variety of the $n$ times punctured sphere. Building on recent results relating middle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements Katz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the $SL_2(\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical results on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite complex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they exist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an exhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also include Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit under this action when it is known to be finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a smooth projective curve and a given embedding into projective space via a sufficiently positive line bundle. We can form the secant variety of $k$-planes through the curve. These are singular varieties, with each secant variety being singular along the last. We study invariants of the singularities for these varieties. In the case of an arbitrary curve, we compute the intersection cohomology in terms of the cohomology of the curve. We then turn our attention to rational normal curves. In this setting, we prove that all of the secant varieties are rational homology manifolds, meaning their singular cohomology satisfies Poincar\'e duality. We then compute the nearby and vanishing cycles for the largest nontrivial secant variety, which is a projective hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops the geometry of locally bounded rational functions on non-singular real algebraic varieties. First various basic geometric and algebraic results regarding these functions are established in any dimension, culminating with a version of {\L}ojasiewicz's inequality. The geometry is further developed for the case of dimension 2, where it can be shown that there exist many of the usual correspondences between the algebra and geometry of these functions that one expects from complex algebraic geometry and from other classes of functions in real algebraic geometry such as regulous functions.</description>

      <title>On the $k$-th Tjurina number of weighted homogeneous singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ (X,0) $ denote an isolated singularity defined by a weighted homogeneous polynomial $ f $. Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be the local algebra of all holomorphic function germs at the origin with the maximal ideal $m $. We study the $k$-th Tjurina algebra, defined by $ A_k(f): = \mathcal{O} / \left( f , m^k J(f) \right) $, where $J(f)$ denotes the Jacobi ideal of $ \mathcal{O}$. The zeroth Tjurina algebra is well known to represent the tangent space of the base space of the semi-universal deformation of $(X, 0)$. Motivated by this observation, we explore the deformation of $(X,0)$ with respect to a fixed $k$-residue point. We show that the tangent space of the corresponding deformation functor is a subspace of the $k$-th Tjurina algebra. Explicitly calculating the $k$-th Tjurina numbers, which correspond to the dimensions of the Tjurina algebra, plays a crucial role in understanding these deformations. According to the results of Milnor and Orlik, the zeroth Tjurina number can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the variables in $f$. However, we observe that for values of $k$ exceeding the multiplicity of $X$, the $k$-th Tjurina number becomes more intricate and is not solely determined by the weights of variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel complex derived from the classical Koszul complex and obtain a computable formula for the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all $ k \geqslant 0 $. As applications, we calculate the $k$-th Tjurina numbers for all weighted homogeneous singularities in three variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subseteq{\mathbb R}^n$ be a convex semialgebraic set. The semidefinite extension degree ${\mathrm{sxdeg}}(K)$ of $K$ is the smallest number $d$ such that $K$ is a linear image of an intersection of finitely many spectrahedra, each of which is described by a linear matrix inequality of size $\le d$. This invariant can be considered to be a measure for the intrinsic complexity of semidefinite optimization over the set $K$. For an arbitrary semialgebraic set $S\subseteq{\mathbb R}^n$ of dimension one, our main result states that the closed convex hull $K$ of $S$ satisfies ${\mathrm{sxdeg}}(K)\le1+\lfloor\frac n2\rfloor$. This bound is best possible in several ways. Before, the result was known for $n=2$, and also for general $n$ in the case where $S$ is a monomial curve.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Special Conjecture contradicts orbifold Mordell, and thus abc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from an Enriques surface over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ considered by Lafon, we give the first examples of smooth projective weakly special threefolds which fiber over the projective line in Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) with nowhere reduced, but non-divisible, fibres and general type orbifold base. We verify that these families of Enriques surfaces (resp. K3 surfaces) are non-isotrivial and compute their fundamental groups by studying the behaviour of local points along certain \'etale covers. The existence of the above threefolds implies that the Weakly Special Conjecture formulated in 2000 contradicts the Orbifold Mordell Conjecture, and hence the abc conjecture. Using these examples, we can also easily disprove several complex-analytic analogues of the Weakly Special Conjecture. Finally, the existence of such threefolds shows that Enriques surfaces and K3 surfaces can have non-divisible but nowhere reduced degenerations, thereby answering a question raised in 2005.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.03947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We (re)introduce the circle method into arithmetic statistics.
  More specifically, we combine the circle method with Bhargava's counting technique in order to give a general method that allows one to treat arithmetic statistical problems in which one is trying to count orbits on a subvariety of affine space defined by the vanishing of a quadratic invariant.
  We explain this method by way of example by computing the average size of $2$-Selmer groups in the families $y^2 = x^3 + B$ and $y^2 = x^3 + B^2$.
  In the course of the argument we introduce a smoothed form of Bhargava's aforementioned method, as well as a trick with which we formally deduce that the above averages are $3$ from knowledge of the averages over "unconstrained" families.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Auslander-Reiten duality and Morita theorem for singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Morita theorem to construct triangle equivalences between the singularity categories of (commutative and non-commutative) Gorenstein rings and the cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras over fields, and more strongly, quasi-equivalences between their canonical dg enhancements. More precisely, we prove that such an equivalence exists as soon as we find a quasi-equivalence between the graded dg singularity category of a Gorenstein ring and the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which can be done by finding a single tilting object.
  Our result is based on two key theorems on dg enhancements of cluster categories and of singularity categories, which are of independent interest. First we give a Morita-type theorem which realizes certain $\mathbb{Z}$-graded dg categories as dg orbit categories. Secondly, we show that the canonical dg enhancements of the singularity categories of symmetric orders have the bimodule Calabi-Yau property, which lifts the classical Auslander-Reiten duality on singularity categories.
  We apply our results to such classes of rings as Gorenstein rings of dimension at most $1$, quotient singularities, and Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections, including finite or infinite Grassmannian cluster categories, to realize their singularity categories as cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a geometric perspective on the algebra of Drinfeld modular forms for congruence subgroups $\Gamma\leq \GL_2(\bbF_q[T]).$ In particular, we describe an isomorphism between the section ring of a line bundle on the stacky modular curve for $\Gamma_2$ and the algebra of Drinfeld modular forms for $\Gamma_2,$ where $\Gamma_2$ is the subgroup of square-determinant matrices in $\Gamma.$ This allows one to compute the latter ring by geometric invariants using the techniques of Voight, Zureick-Brown and O'Dorney. We also show how to decompose the algebra of modular forms for $\Gamma_2$ into a direct sum of two algebras of modular forms for $\Gamma$ and generalize this result to a larger class of congruence subgroups.</description>

      <title>Products of curves as ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $g_1, g_2 \ge 0$, this paper shows that there is a cocompact lattice $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{PU}(2,1)$ such that the ball quotient $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2$ is birational to a product $C_1 \times C_2$ of smooth projective curves $C_j$ of genus $g_j$. The only prior examples were $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, due to Deligne--Mostow and rediscovered by many others, and a lesser-known product of elliptic curves whose existence follows from work of Hirzebruch. Combined with related new examples, this answers the rational variant of a question of Gromov in the positive for surfaces of Kodaira dimension $\kappa \le 0$, namely that they admit deformations $V^\prime$ such that there is a compact ball quotient $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2$ with a rational map $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{B}^2 \dashrightarrow V^\prime$. Often the proof gives the stronger conclusion that $V^\prime$ is birational to a ball quotient orbifold. It also follows that every simply connected $4$-manifold is dominated by a complex hyperbolic manifold. All examples considered in this paper are shown to be arithmetic, and even arithmeticity of Hirzebruch's example appears to be new.</description>

      <title>Modular Calabi-Yau Fourfolds and Connections to M-Theory Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the local zeta functions of Calabi-Yau fourfolds. This is done by developing arithmetic deformation techniques to compute the factor of the zeta function that is attributed to the horizontal four-form cohomology. This, in turn, is sensitive to the complex structure of the fourfold. Focusing mainly on examples of fourfolds with a single complex structure parameter, it is demonstrated that the proposed arithmetic techniques are both applicable and consistent. We present a Calabi-Yau fourfold for which a factor of the horizontal four-form cohomology further splits into two pieces of Hodge type $(4,0)+(2,2)+(0,4)$ and $(3,1)+(1,3)$. The latter factor corresponds to a weight-3 modular form, which allows expressing the value of the periods in terms of critical values of the L-function of this modular form, in accordance with Deligne's conjecture. The arithmetic considerations are related to M-theory Calabi-Yau fourfold compactifications with background four-form fluxes. We classify such background fluxes according to their Hodge type. For those fluxes associated to modular forms, we express their couplings in the low-energy effective action in terms of L-function values.</description>
