      <title>Information geometry of chemical reaction networks: Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is based on classical Legendre duality but allows to incorporate additional structure such as algebraic constraints and Bregman divergence functions. It is naturally suited, and has been successfully used, to describe the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) based on the Legendre duality between concentration and potential spaces, where algebraic constraints are enforced by the stoichiometry. In this article, the Riemannian geometrical aspects of the theory are explored. It is shown that duality between concentration and potential spaces and the natural parametrizations of equilibrium subspace are isometries, which leads to a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound through the comparison of two Riemannian metric tensors.
  In the subsequent part, the theory is applied to the recently introduced concept of absolute sensitivity. Using the Riemannian geometric tools, it is proven that the absolute sensitivity is a projection operator onto the tangent bundle of the equilibrium manifold. A linear algebraic characterization and explicit results on first order corrections to the thermodynamics of ideal solutions are provided. Finally, the theory is applied to the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system.
  The novelty of the theory is that it is applicable to CRNs with non-ideal thermodynamical behavior, which are prevalent in highly crowded cellular environments due to various interactions between the chemicals. Indeed, the analyzed example shows remarkable behavior ranging from hypersensitivity to negative-self regulations. These are effects which usually require strongly nonlinear reaction kinetics. However, here, they are obtained by tuning thermodynamical interactions providing a complementary, and physically well-founded, viewpoint on such phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>
