      <title>Low-Energy Nuclear Recoil Calibration of XENONnT with a $^{88}$YBe Photoneutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing low-energy (O(1keV)) nuclear recoils near the detector threshold is one of the major challenges for large direct dark matter detectors. To that end, we have successfully used a Yttrium-Beryllium photoneutron source that emits 152 keV neutrons for the calibration of the light and charge yields of the XENONnT experiment for the first time. After data selection, we accumulated 474 events from 183 hours of exposure with this source. The expected background was $55 \pm 12$ accidental coincidence events, estimated using a dedicated 152 hour background calibration run with a Yttrium-PVC gamma-only source and data-driven modeling. From these calibrations, we extracted the light yield and charge yield for liquid xenon at our field strength of 23 V/cm between 0.5 keV$_{\rm NR}$ and 5.0 keV$_{\rm NR}$ (nuclear recoil energy in keV). This calibration is crucial for accurately measuring the solar $^8$B neutrino coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and searching for light dark matter particles with masses below 12 GeV/c$^2$.</description>

      <title>IBIC analysis of a linear position sensitive detector: model and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ion beam-induced charge (IBIC) analysis of a commercial silicon photodiode configured as a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) for energetic charged particles is the subject of this report. Although the photodiode is designed for detecting the position of incident light and optimized for use in the UV region, we present evidence that it also performs well as a detector for ions, with energies in the MeV range. The device consists of a uniform p-type layer formed on a high-resistivity n-type semiconductor substrate, a pair of electrodes on both ends of the resistive layer, and a common electrode located on the backside of the substrate. The IBIC experiment was carried out at the Laboratory for Ion Beam Interaction (LIBI) of the Ruder Boskovic Institute in Zagreb (HR), using 2 MeV proton microbeam raster scanning the 2.5x0.6 mm2 active area of the PSD. Each of the three electrodes was connected to independent standard NIM charge-sensitive electronic chain and the induced charge pulses associated with the position of individual ions were then digitized using a multi-channel analyzer interfaced with the SPECTOR software. The longitudinal Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) profiles acquired from the top electrodes show linear behaviors with opposite slopes, whereas the profile relevant to the signals from the back electrode is almost constant. A model based on the IBIC theory satisfactorily interprets these results. It offers an alternative viewpoint to the commonly adopted Lateral Effect Photodiode principle and paves the way for the development of new PSDs for the identification of the impact position of a MeV ion with a resolution at the micrometer scale.</description>

      <title>A Novel Low-Background Photomultiplier Tube Developed for Xenon Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are essential in xenon detectors like PandaX, LZ, and XENON experiments for dark matter searches and neutrino properties measurement. To minimize PMT-induced backgrounds, stringent requirements on PMT radioactivity are crucial. A novel 2-inch low-background R12699 PMT has been developed through a collaboration between the PandaX team and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. corporation. Radioactivity measurements conducted with a high-purity germanium detector show levels of approximately 0.08 mBq/PMT for $\rm^{60}Co$ and 0.06~mBq/PMT for the $\rm^{238}U$ late chain, achieving a 15-fold reduction compared to R11410 PMT used in PandaX-4T. The radon emanation rate is below 3.2 $\rm \mu$Bq/PMT (@90\% confidence level), while the surface $\rm^{210}Po$ activity is less than 18.4 $\mu$Bq/cm$^2$. The electrical performance of these PMTs at cryogenic temperature was evaluated. With an optimized voltage distribution, the gain was enhanced by 30\%, achieving an average gain of $4.23 \times 10^6$ at -1000~V and -100~$^{\circ}$C. The dark count rate averaged 2.5~Hz per channel. Compactness, low radioactivity, and robust electrical performance in the cryogenic temperature make the R12699 PMT ideal for next-generation liquid xenon detectors and other rare event searches.</description>

      <title>Performance of an instrumented baffle placed at the entrance of Virgo's end mirror vacuum tower during O5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present results on the simulated performance of an instrumented baffle installed at the entrance of the vacuum towers hosting the end mirrors of Virgo's main Fabry-P\'erot cavities. The installation of instrumented baffles is part of the Advanced Virgo Plus upgrade in time for the O5 observing run. They were originally envisaged to be suspended, mounted on new payloads and surrounding new larger end mirrors. The current Virgo upgrade plan includes the replacement of the mirrors with new ones of better quality and same dimensions, leaving the installation of new payloads and larger end mirrors to a post-O5 upgrade phase still to be defined. Here we demonstrate that placing the instrumented baffles just beyond the cryotrap gate valve and in front of the end mirrors would be equally effective for monitoring scattered light inside the cavities. This new location, more than a meter away from the mirror, further reduces the risk of contamination and any potential interference with the mirrors, preserves the full capability to monitor scattered light, and decouples the instrumented baffle timeline from the plans for installing large mirrors in the experiment. We provide an estimate of the light distribution the baffles would encounter under both nominal and non-nominal conditions, as well as an assessment of the scattered light noise introduced by these baffles in this new location, confirming that they would not compromise Virgo's sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Local Area Cooling versus Broad Area Cooling for Boil-Off Reduction in Large-Scale Liquid Hydrogen Storage Tanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future use of liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$) as an effective energy carrier will require elimination or minimization of hydrogen boil-off that is not utilized by demands in the value chain. The present work promotes local area cooling (LAC) as a promising boil-off reduction technology. In contrast to the more conventional broad area cooling (BAC), LAC targets local, concentrated heat flows e.g. through tank support structures. This yields important practical benefits, especially for large-scale tanks, due to the order-of-magnitude reduction in the size of the cooling system. Such benefits include lower capital costs and simpler installation, maintenance and coolant management. LAC applied outside the outer tank wall is particularly attractive for tanks with evacuated insulation.
  In a series of numerical studies, we use the finite element method to evaluate the thermal performance of LAC and BAC in the context of ship-borne LH$_2$ transport. The studies concern 40 000 m$^3$-capacity, skirt-supported tanks insulated using evacuated perlite or helium-filled polyurethane (HePUR) foam. For the perlite-insulated tank, LAC and BAC with liquid nitrogen coolant can reduce the daily boiloff rate from 0.04%/day to, respectively, 0.011%/day and 0.004%/day. The corresponding numbers for CO$_2$-based refrigeration are 0.031%/day and 0.028%/day. For the HePUR-insulated tank, which has a higher baseline boil-off rate of 0.24%/day, reduced boil-off rates down to 0.17%/day and 0.04%/day are achievable using LAC and BAC, respectively. LAC and BAC both offer increased power efficiency in comparison to reliquefaction only.</description>

      <title>Estimating Potential Tritium and Plutonium Production in North Korea's Experimental Light Water Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work explores North Korea's 100 MW-th Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR) and its potential contributions to the country's nuclear weapons program. Built at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, the ELWR began operations in October 2023 and represents North Korea's first attempts at a light-water reactor using domestically-enriched, ceramic fuel. Our study examines possible configurations for energy, tritium, and tritium-plutonium co-production. Assuming a single-batch core, the ELWR can be used to annually produce 48-82 grams of tritium, which can supply 2-4 new boosted warheads each year, up to a maximum arsenal of 88-150 warheads total. Concurrent production of tritium and weapon-grade plutonium is also possible but requires reprocessing of spent ceramic fuel. These findings underscore how North Korea's nuclear capabilities may be advanced through the ELWR's dual-use potential.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Coupling of Axion Dark Matter to Neutron Spins at Spallation Sources via Rabi Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel detection method for axion dark matter using the Rabi oscillation of neutron spins in beam-based measurements. If axions couple to neutron spins, a background oscillating axion dark matter field would drive transitions between spin-up and spin-down neutron states in a magnetic field when the axion particle energy matches the energy gap between the spin states. The transition can be detected in a double-Stern-Gerlach-type apparatus, with the first splitter producing a pure spin-polarized neutron beam and the second splitter selecting spin-flipped signals. Our approach offers enhanced detection capability for axions within the $10^{-12} - 10^{-10} \,$eV mass window with the capability to surpass the sensitivity of current laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring Offline Pileup Correction to Improve the Accuracy of Microdosimetric Characterization in Clinical Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microdosimetry investigates the energy deposition of ionizing radiation at microscopic scales, beyond the assessment capabilities of macroscopic dosimetry. This contributes to an understanding of the biological response in radiobiology, radiation protection and radiotherapy. Microdosimetric pulse height spectra are usually measured using an ionization detector in a pulsed readout mode. This incorporates and a charge-sensitive amplifier followed by a shaping network. At high particle rates, the pileup of multiple pulses leads to distortions in the recorded spectra. Especially for gas-based detectors, this is a significant issue, that can be reduced by using solid-state detectors with smaller cross-sectional areas and faster readout speeds. At particle rates typical for ion therapy, however, such devices will also experience pileup. Mitigation techniques often focus on avoiding pileup altogether, while post-processing approaches are rarely investigated. This work explores pileup effects in microdosimetric measurements and presents a stochastic resampling algorithm, allowing for offline simulation and correction of spectra. Initially it was developed for measuring neutron spectra with tissue equivalent proportional counters and is adapted for the use with solid-state microdosimeters in a clinical radiotherapy setting. The algorithm was tested on data acquired with solid-state microdosimeters at the MedAustron ion therapy facility. The successful simulation and reduction of pileup counts is achieved by establishing of a limited number of parameters for a given setup. The presented results illustrate the potential of offline correction methods in situations where a direct pileup-free measurement is currently not practicable.</description>

      <title>Parallel CPU- and GPU-based connected component algorithms for event building for hybrid pixel detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest generation of Timepix series hybrid pixel detectors enhance particle tracking with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, their high hit-rate capability poses challenges for data processing, particularly in multidetector configurations or systems like Timepix4. Storing and processing each hit offline is inefficient for such high data throughput. To efficiently group partly unsorted pixel hits into clusters for particle event characterization, we explore parallel approaches for online clustering to enable real-time data reduction. Although using multiple CPU cores improved throughput, scaling linearly with the number of cores, load-balancing issues between processing and I/O led to occasional data loss. We propose a parallel connected component labeling algorithm using a union-find structure with path compression optimized for zero-suppression data encoding. Our GPU implementation achieved a throughput of up to 300 million hits per second, providing a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over compared CPU-based methods while also freeing CPU resources for I/O handling and reducing the data loss.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model for a Piezoelectric Energy Harvester Driven by Broadband Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental and numerical study of a piezoelectric energy harvester driven by broadband vibrations. This device can extract power from random fluctuations and can be described by a stochastic model, based on an underdamped Langevin equation with white noise, which mimics the dynamics of the piezoelectric material. A crucial point in the modelisation is represented by the appropriate description of the coupled load circuit that is necessary to harvest electrical energy. We consider a linear load (resistance) and a nonlinear load (diode bridge rectifier connected to the parallel of a capacitance and a load resistance), and focus on the characteristic curve of the extracted power as a function of the load resistance, in order to estimate the optimal values of the parameters that maximise the collected energy. In both cases, we find good agreement between the numerical simulations of the theoretical model and the results obtained in experiments. In particular, we observe a non-monotonic behaviour of the characteristic curve which signals the presence of an optimal value for the load resistance at which the extracted power is maximised. We also address a more theoretical issue, related to the inference of the non-equilibrium features of the system from data: we show that the analysis of high-order correlation functions of the relevant variables, when in the presence of nonlinearities, can represent a simple and effective tool to check the irreversible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fault Localization in a Microfabricated Surface Ion Trap using Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computing hardware becomes more complex with ongoing design innovations and growing capabilities, the quantum computing community needs increasingly powerful techniques for fabrication failure root-cause analysis. This is especially true for trapped-ion quantum computing. As trapped-ion quantum computing aims to scale to thousands of ions, the electrode numbers are growing to several hundred with likely integrated-photonic components also adding to the electrical and fabrication complexity, making faults even harder to locate. In this work, we used a high-resolution quantum magnetic imaging technique, based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, to investigate short-circuit faults in an ion trap chip. We imaged currents from these short-circuit faults to ground and compared to intentionally-created faults, finding that the root-cause of the faults was failures in the on-chip trench capacitors. This work, where we exploited the performance advantages of a quantum magnetic sensing technique to troubleshoot a piece of quantum computing hardware, is a unique example of the evolving synergy between emerging quantum technologies to achieve capabilities that were previously inaccessible.</description>

The unique combination of micron-scale spatial resolution of scalar or vector fields at room temperature and parallel camera readout make this an appealing technique for applications in biology, geology, condensed-matter physics, and electronics. However, while NV magnetic microscopy has achieved great success in these areas, historically the accessible frequency range has been limited. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by implementing the recently developed technique of quantum frequency mixing. With this approach, we generate wide-field magnetic images of test structures driven by alternating currents up to 70 MHz, well outside the reach of DC and Rabi magnetometry methods. With further improvements, this approach could find utility in hyperspectral imaging for electronics power spectrum analysis, electronics diagnostics and troubleshooting, and quantum computing hardware validation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the data aggregation concepts for STS readout in the CBM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The STS detector in the CBM experiment delivers data via multiple E-Links connected to GBTX ASICs. In the process of data aggregation, that data must be received, combined into a smaller number of streams, and packed into so-called microslices containing data from specific periods. The aggregation must consider data randomization due to amplitude-dependent processing time in the FEE ASICs and different occupancy of individual E-Links. During the development of the STS readout, the continued progress in the available technology affected the requirements for data aggregation, its architecture, and algorithms. The contribution presents considered solutions and discusses their properties.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of a fully 3D-printed plastic scintillator particle detector prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary particles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting the detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel prototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array of 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative approach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a single operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing and assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization during a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical crosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype demonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.) per channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk between adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within individual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and reproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive manufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of high-granularity scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Anamorphic catadioptric telescope and generalized spherical aberration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberration components is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. An example compensation rules are derived for the double-plane symmetric optical system containing reflective and refractive subsystems, which focus light in the orthogonal directions at the image plane. An economical anamorphic extension of the Cassegrain-type cylindrical mirror system has been simulated with a ray-tracing code. Anamorphic telescopes of the introduced type provide independent focal distances in the two orthogonal planes allowing to set up a favorable field of view.</description>

      <title>Methods for energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy with photon-counting and deconvolution techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential for studying material properties, but the small cross-sections of some methods may result in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the collected spectra. In this article we present methods, based on combining Bragg spectroscopy with photon counting and deconvolution algorithms, which increase the SNRs, making the spectra better suited to further analysis. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide for constructing spectra from camera images. The efficacy of these methods is validated on synthetic and experimental data, the latter coming from the field of high-energy density (HED) science, where x-ray spectroscopy is essential for the understanding of materials under extreme thermodynamic conditions.</description>
