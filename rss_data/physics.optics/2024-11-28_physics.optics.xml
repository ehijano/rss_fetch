      <title>Merging high localization and TE-TM polarization degeneracy of guided waves in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization degree of freedom is an inherent feature of plane waves propagating in an isotropic homogeneous medium. The miniaturization of optical systems leads to the high localization of electromagnetic waves, but also to the loss of polarization control, namely, breaking TE-TM polarization degeneracy. In this work, we discover the near-field polarization degree of freedom for highly localized guided waves propagating along a dielectric metasurface. We demonstrate the opportunity to create a metasurface with the degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum for the required operating wavelength and different constitutive materials. In particular, we analyze several possible implementations including silicon nitride and ceramic metasurfaces consisting of disk-shaped resonators, and evaluate the impact of substrate. Finally, we experimentally implement one of the metasurface designs and verify its broadband degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum. The obtained results form a fundamentally new platform for the planar polarization devices utilizing the polarization degree of freedom of localized light.</description>

      <title>Topological Momentum Skyrmions in Mie Scattering Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quasiparticles such as skyrmions and merons have recently attracted enormous attentions in the form of diverse optical degrees of freedom. However, these structures have not been explored in the fundamental momentum vectors of optical fields yet. Here, we reveal the universality of forming skyrmion and meron topological textures from the Poynting vector, canonical momentum, and optical spin field, which are generated from multipole Mie scattering fields. Moreover, we analyze the unconditional topological stability of the skyrmionic momentum fields against perturbation and geometric defects. This work reveals the topological properties of multipole scattered field and will spur new phenomena related to optical forces, metamaterial design and unique light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Multi-focal Picosecond laser vertical slicing of 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser direct writing inside materials has garnered significant attention for its applications in techniques like two-photon polymerization, stealth dicing and vertical slicing. 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) vertical slicing has wide potentials from research to industry due to low kerf loss and high slicing speed. In this paper, to improve the vertical slicing processing quality and lower the separation strength, we introduce a multi-focal vertical slicing method with spherical aberrations caused by refractive index eliminated. Additionally, by shaping the wavefront of picosecond laser, our experiments show the lower latitudinal ablation zone and higher crack propagation of multi-focal vertical slicing method on 4H-SiC, demonstrating that this method not only reduces filamentations to minimize ablation damage, but also significantly reduce the tensile strength during separation. We achieve a 6 inch 4H-SiC ingot vertical slicing and separation using 4-focal slicing. This method shows various potentials in laser processing.</description>

      <title>Circularly polarized cavity-mode emission from quantum dots in a semiconductor three-dimensional chiral photonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrated a circularly polarized cavity mode in a GaAs-based chiral photonic crystal (PhC) containing a planar defect. Low-temperature photoluminescence measurements of InAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in the planar defect revealed a polarization bandgap for left-handed circularly polarized light in the near-infrared spectrum. Within this bandgap, where the QDs preferably emitted right-handed circularly polarized light, we observed a distinct cavity-mode peak characterized by left-handed circular polarization. This observation indicates that the chiral PhC modifies the optical density of states for left-handed circular polarization to be suppressed in the polarization bandgap and be largely enhanced at the cavity mode. The results obtained may not only provide photonic devices such as compact circularly polarized light sources but also promote strong coupling between circularly polarized photons and excitons in solid states or molecules, paving the way for advancements in polaritonics, spintronics, and quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Loss-driven miniaturized bound state in continuum biosensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurface has brought a revolution in label-free molecular sensing, attracting extensive attention. Currently, such sensing approaches are being designed to respond to peak wavelengths with a higher Q factor in the visible and near-infrared regions.Nevertheless, a higher Q factor that enhances light confinement will inevitably deteriorate the wavelength sensitivity and complicate the sensing system. We propose a Q-switched sensing mechanism, which enables the real part of the refractive index to effectively perturbate the damping loss of the oscillator, resulting in a boost of peak intensity.Consequently, a higher Q factor in Q-switched sensor can further enhance the peak sensitivity while remaining compatible with broadband light sources, simultaneously meeting the requirements of high performance and a compact system.This is achieved in a unique 3D bound-state-in-continuum (BIC) metasurface which can be mass-produced by wafer-scale aluminum-nanoimprinting technology and provides a peak intensity sensitivity up to 928 %/RIU.Therefore, a miniaturized BIC biosensing system is realized, with a limit of detection to 10E-5 refractive index units and 129 aM extracellular vesicles in clinical lung cancer diagnosis, both of which are magnitudes lower than those of current state-of-the-art biosensors. It further demonstrates significant potential for home cancer self-testing equipment for post-operative follow-up. This Q-switched sensing mechanism offers a new perspective for the commercialization of advanced and practical BIC optical biosensing systems in real-setting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optical characterisation of ilmenite by reflectance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-directional reflection spectroscopy based on multiple scattering of particulate surfaces is employed in identifying the optical properties of titanium-iron oxide mineral from laboratory reflection measurements.However, the approach suffers from issues including: i) both n and k are to be extracted from a single spectroscopy spectrum, ii) imposing constraints of the K-K correlation relating spectral n and k is weakened by its fundamental insensitivity, and iii) incapability in addressing intrinsic strong absorption features of absorbing materials. We resolve these issues by employing additional optical information of directional-hemispherical reflection and emission/absorption for a slab and a stratified multi-layer medium of the material, respectively. The accompanied analyses consist of radiation transfer in a slab medium investigated using the two-flux approximation method and electromagnetic radiation propagation in a stratified multi-layer medium investigated using the electric filed transfer matrix. We further find that an understanding of the internal scattering coefficient of grains in the multiple scattering model paves the way in successfully predicting absorption features of materials. A wavelength-dependent internal scattering coefficient of the material is then found to be 50 1/micrometer and 1/10000000 1/micrometer in regions of strong absorption and high transmission (between 7 and 13 micrometer), respectively. The value of the refractive index n varies weakly on the wavelength. A pronounced change in the determined absorptive index k with the wavelength is observed. Low values of the absorptive index k on the magnitude of 0.01 are obtained in the transmission window spectral range. In the strong absorption spectral range starting from 13 micrometer, values of the absorptive index k are higher than 0.1.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Crosstalk Silicon Electro-Optic Switch with Cascaded Phase Shifters for Loss Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silicon electro-optic (EO) Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) switches, crosstalk is typically limited by beam imbalance between the MZI arms, primarily caused by the free carrier absorption loss during routing, thus hindering switch scalability. To address this issue, we propose a low-crosstalk push-pull EO MZI switch by cascading a lightly doped, long phase shifter (PSLL) and a heavily doped, short phase shifter (PSHS) to construct phase-shift arms. In both BAR and CROSS states, PSLL in one arm and PSHS in the other arm are simultaneously forward-biased, with PSLL provides a pi/2 greater phase shift for switching, while PSHS balances loss of PSLL, effectively minimizing crosstalk. Simulations indicate that the proposed switch achieves a crosstalk below -51 dB at a 1310 nm wavelength. The fabricated 2 x 2 silicon EO MZI switch exhibited crosstalk between -33 and -44.2 dB at 1316 nm, and maintained crosstalk below -30 dB across an impressive 61 nm optical bandwidth, with response times under 119 ns. Featuring single-pair electrode control, consistent two-state performance, and a compact size, this approach could enable high-radix switch fabrics in data centers and artificial intelligence compute clusters.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Stokes origami: folds, cusps and skyrmionic facets in random polarisation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the jacobian of a random transverse polarisation field, from the transverse plane to the Poincar\'e sphere, as a Skyrme density partially covering the sphere. Connected domains of the plane where the jacobian has the same sign -- patches -- map to facets subtending some general solid angle on the Poincar\'e sphere. As a generic continuous mapping between surfaces, we interpret the polarisation pattern on the sphere in terms of fold lines (corresponding to the crease lines between neighbouring patches) and cusp points (where fold lines meet). We perform a basic statistical analysis of the properties of the patches and facets, including a brief discussion of the percolation properties of the jacobian domains. Connections with abstract origami manifolds are briefly considered. This analysis combines previous studies of structured skyrmionic polarisation patterns with random polarisation patterns, suggesting a particle-like interpretation of random patches as polarisation skyrmionic anyons.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <title>High-throughput antibody screening with high-quality factor nanophotonics and bioprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical investigation of the quintillion-scale, functionally diverse antibody repertoires that can be generated synthetically or naturally is critical for identifying potential biotherapeutic leads, yet remains burdensome. We present high-throughput nanophotonics- and bioprinter-enabled screening (HT-NaBS), a multiplexed assay for large-scale, sample-efficient, and rapid characterization of antibody libraries. Our platform is built upon independently addressable pixelated nanoantennas exhibiting wavelength-scale mode volumes, high-quality factors (high-Q) exceeding 5000, and pattern densities exceeding one million sensors per square centimeter. Our custom-built acoustic bioprinter enables individual sensor functionalization via the deposition of picoliter droplets from a library of capture antigens at rates up to 25,000 droplets per second. We detect subtle differentiation in the target binding signature through spatially-resolved spectral imaging of hundreds of resonators simultaneously, elucidating antigen-antibody binding kinetic rates, affinity constant, and specificity. We demonstrate HT-NaBS on a panel of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B antigens, with a sub-picomolar limit of detection within 30 minutes. Furthermore, through epitope binning analysis, we demonstrate the competence and diversity of a library of native antibodies targeting functional epitopes on a priority pathogen (H5N1 bird flu) and on glycosylated therapeutic Cetuximab antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor. With a roadmap to image tens of thousands of sensors simultaneously, this high-throughput, resource-efficient, and label-free platform can rapidly screen for high-affinity and broad epitope coverage, accelerating biotherapeutic discovery and de novo protein design.</description>

      <title>Frequency redistribution and step-size distribution of light scattered by atomic vapor: applications to L\'evy flight random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation of light that undergoes multiple-scattering by resonant atomic vapor can be described as a L\'evy flight. L\'evy flight is a random walk with heavy tailed step-size (r) distribution, decaying asymptotically as $P(r)\sim r^{-1-\alpha}$, with $\alpha&lt;2$. The large steps, typical of L\'evy flights, have its origins in frequency redistribution of the light scattered by the vapor. We calculate the frequency redistribution function and the step-size distribution for light diffusion in atomic vapor. From the step-size distribution we extract a L\'evy parameter $\alpha$ that depends on the step's size. We investigate how the frequency redistribution function and step-size distribution are influenced by the finite size of the vapor and the many-level structure typical for alkali vapors. Finite size of the vapor introduces cutoff on the light scattered spectrum and thus in the size of steps. Multi-level structure introduces oscillations in $P(r)$ slope. Both effects might have an impact on measurables related to the L\'evy flight random walk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TorchOptics is an open-source Python library for differentiable Fourier optics simulations, developed using PyTorch to enable GPU-accelerated tensor computations and automatic differentiation. It provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing optical systems using Fourier optics, with applications in imaging, diffraction, holography, and signal processing. The library leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine for gradient-based optimization, enabling the inverse design of complex optical systems. TorchOptics supports end-to-end optimization of hybrid models that integrate optical systems with machine learning architectures for digital post-processing. The library includes a wide range of optical elements and spatial profiles, and supports simulations with polarized light and fields with arbitrary spatial coherence.</description>

      <title>Polaron effect in waveguide quantum optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the quantized mechanical motion of optically trapped atoms, arranged in proximity to a one-dimensional waveguide, on the propagation of polariton modes. Our study identifies a regime of resonant phonon-assisted mixing between lower and upper polaritons, resulting in a pronounced polaron effect. This effect is characterized by the formation of new band gaps and the appearance of weakly dispersive states within the original polariton band gap. The polaron spectrum, which can be directly probed via resonant elastic scattering, provides novel opportunities for quantum optical applications. These findings open avenues for enhanced control in state-of-the-art waveguide quantum electrodynamics experiments with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Open-shell TADF: Quartet-derived luminescence with dark radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read-out via luminescence. Here we demonstrate a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet-derived luminescence, formed by appending a non-luminescent TEMPO radical to Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet-triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical-triplet coupled states. We establish a set of design rules by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. We observe generation of quartet states and measure the strength of radical-triplet exchange (0.7 GHz). In DMAC-TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high-spin state.

      <title>Discrete and parallel frequency-bin entanglement generation from quantum frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photons' frequency degree of freedom is promising to realize large-scale quantum information processing. Quantum frequency combs (QFCs) generated in integrated nonlinear microresonators can produce multiple frequency modes with narrow linewidth. Here, we utilize polarization-entangled QFCs to generate discrete frequency-bin entangled states. Fourteen pairs of polarization-entangled photons with different frequencies are simultaneously transformed into frequency-bin entangled states. The characteristic of frequency-bin entanglement is demonstrated by Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, which can be performed with single or multiple frequency pairs in parallel. Our work paves the way for harnessing large-scale frequency-bin entanglement and converting between different degrees of freedom in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit the first analogue model of a rotating black hole constructed in the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The background electromagnetic field is assumed to be algebraically special and adapted to a geodesic shear-free congruence of null rays in Minkowski spacetime, the Kerr congruence. The corresponding optical metric has a Kerr-Schild form and, it is shown to be characterized by three parameters, thus predicting the existence of an ergosurface, a horizon, and a slice identical to one also present in the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Discussions on the spatial exponential growth of electromagnetic quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temporal response of open systems is marked by damped oscillations. These oscillations, often referred to as ringings, are the signature of the decay of quasinormal modes (QNMs). A major research objective across various fields is to represent the response of open systems using QNM expansions, akin to the treatment of normal modes in closed systems. In electromagnetism, it is widely acknowledged that QNM expansions provide a relevant representation of the modal physics within the interior of compact resonators in free space, where QNMs form a complete set of the resonator. However, challenges emerge in the exterior of the resonator, where QNM fields exhibit exponential divergence, rendering QNM expansions incomplete. The divergence poses delicate mathematical issues that often lead to misinterpretations on the physics side. Hereafter, we analyze foundational concepts such as cavity perturbation theory and dissipative coupling between resonators. By studying model problems, we show that the exponential growth is physical and meaningful for understanding the interaction between remote electromagnetic bodies. The analysis consistently reveals that the coupling coefficients between QNMs of two distant bodies strengthen as the separation distance increases, therein challenging the intuition that distant bodies behave independently. These insights that shed light on the origin and implications of the divergence hold significant implications for understanding the ability of contemporary electromagnetic QNM theories in offering a modal representation of the physics in the open space surrounding resonator bodies. Our critical examination of these theories reveals the existence of two distinct perspectives and elucidates the significance of their contrasting viewpoints.</description>

      <title>MoS2-based optical bistability in silver-Bragg reflector multilayer structure at visible light band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the optical bistability in a metallic silver-Bragg reflector structure by embedding bilayer MoS2 at the visible band. The nonlinear OB is achieved due to the nonlinear conductivity of the bilayer MoS2 and the excitation of the optical Tamm state at the interface between the silver and the Bragg reflector. It is found that the hysteresis behaviour and the threshold width of the OB can be effectively tuned by varying the incident light wavelength. In addition, the optical bistable behaviour of the structure can be adjusted by varying the position of the MoS2 inset in the defect layer, incident angle and the structural parameters of the spacer layer. Although the current threshold cannot be commercialized, we believe that this solution will provide a meaningful path reference for low threshold bistability in the visible light band.</description>

      <title>Disordered Optical Metasurfaces: Basics, Properties, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are conventionally viewed as organized flat arrays of photonic or plasmonic nanoresonators, also called metaatoms. These metasurfaces are typically highly ordered and fabricated with precision using expensive tools. However, the inherent imperfections in large-scale nanophotonic devices, along with recent advances in bottom-up nanofabrication techniques and design strategies, have highlighted the potential benefits of incorporating disorder to achieve specific optical functionalities. This review offers an overview of the key theoretical, numerical, and experimental aspects related to the exploration of disordered optical metasurfaces. It introduces fundamental concepts of light scattering by disordered metasurfaces and outlines theoretical and numerical methodologies for analyzing their optical behavior. Various fabrication techniques are discussed, highlighting the types of disorder they deliver and their achievable precision level. The review also explores critical applications of disordered optical metasurfaces, such as light manipulation in thin film materials and the design of structural colors and visual appearances. Finally, the article offers perspectives on the burgeoning future research in this field. Disordered optical metasurfaces offer a promising alternative to their ordered counterparts, often delivering unique functionalities or enhanced performance. They present a particularly exciting opportunity in applications demanding large-scale implementation, such as sustainable renewable energy systems, as well as aesthetically vibrant coatings for luxury goods and architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Small-scale light structures in a Kerr medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of equations has been proposed for a monochromatic weakly nonlinear light wave in a Kerr medium. This system is equivalent up to the third order in electric field to the known equation $\mbox{curl}\,\mbox{curl}\, {\bf E}=k_0^2[{\bf E} +\alpha |{\bf E}|^2{\bf E}+\beta({\bf E}\cdot{\bf E}){\bf E}^*]$, but the new equations are much more convenient for numerical computation. Optical fields with small structures of two or three wavelengths have been simulated using this system. It has been found that a stable self-focused light beam (a 2D vector soliton) in some parametric domain is possible even without modification of nonlinearity. ``Inelastic'' collisions between two such narrow beams with opposite circular polarizations have been computed. Furthermore, examples of interacting optical vortices, spatial separation of the circular polarizations, and the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability have been given for defocusing nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution visualization of atomic structures as well as various functional imaging modes utilizing phase contrast. In this study we introduce a semicircular aperture in STEM bright field imaging, which gives a phase contrast transfer function that becomes complex and includes both lower and higher spatial frequency contrast transfer. This approach offers significant advantages over conventional phase plate methods, having no charge accumulation, degradation, or unwanted background noise, which are all problematic in the phase plate material. Also compared to the differential phase contrast or ptychography equipment, this semicircular aperture is far less costly. We apply this approach to visualization of polymer, biological and magnetic samples.</description>

      <title>Synthetic gain for electron-beam spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-beam microscopy and spectroscopy featuring atomic-scale spatial resolution have become essential tools used daily in almost all branches of nanoscale science and technology. As a natural supercontinuum source of light, free electrons couple with phonons, plasmons, electron-hole pairs, inter- and intra-band transitions, and inner-shell ionization. The multiple excitations, intertwined with the intricate nature of nanostructured samples, present significant challenges in isolating specific spectral characteristics amidst complex experimental backgrounds. Here we introduce the approach of synthetic complex frequency waves to mitigate these challenges in free-electron--light interaction. The complex frequency waves, created through causality-informed coherent superposition of real-frequency waves induced by free electrons, offer virtual gain to offset material losses. This amplifies and enhances spectral features, as confirmed by our electron energy loss and cathodoluminescence measurements on multi-layer membranes, suspended nanoparticles, and film-coupled nanostructures. Strikingly, we reveal that our approach can retrieve resonance excitation completely buried underneath the zero-loss peak, substantially enhance the quality of hyperspectral imaging, and resolve entangled multiple-photon-electron events in their quantum interaction. Our findings indicate the versatile utility of complex frequency waves in various electron-beam spectroscopy and their promising diagnostic capabilities in free-electron quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Generation of vortex electrons by atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is determined solely by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario - a localized finite-sized atomic target - and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>A family of Fourier transform's eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a family of Fourier eigenfunctions indexed by the space dimension d. These eigenfunctions are radial and built upon some generalized exponential integral function. For d=1,2,3, they are integrable or square integrable and give new explicit examples of Fourier eigenfunctions in the usual or Fourier-Plancherel sense. For d&gt;3, the functions are examples of non standard eigenfunctions, i.e. eigenfunctions in the sense of distribution. The discovery of these eigenfunctions stems from research in thermal lens spectroscopy, at the intersection of thermodynamics and optics. Their use could simplify the analysis of thermo-optical systems, paving the way for applications in optical computing, material studies and thermodynamic.</description>
