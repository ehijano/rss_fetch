      <title>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the transition temperature of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates by means of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action formalism within the framework of the improved Hartree-Fock approximation. Influence of intra- and interspecies interactions as well as of the thermal fluctuations to the transition temperature are considered up to leading order of the gas parameters and scattering lengths.</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of the Unruh Temperature the Thermal Properties of Virtually Evolving Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel theoretical model to simulate the Unruh temperature by relating it to the critical temperature of multiple Bose-Einstein thermal baths. These thermal baths are conceptualized as snapshots of a Bose-Firework originating from an evolving driven Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The critical temperature of each snapshot is determined from the heat capacity, which is numerically estimated by calculating the partition function derived from the system's Hamiltonian. By analyzing the relationship between the average number of the phononic excitations at the critical temperature, acceleration, and the critical temperature itself, our model demonstrates a significant agreement with the Unruh temperature formula, thereby validating our hypothesis. This theoretical approach offers a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to resource-intensive experimental simulations. Furthermore, it provides a unique perspective on quantum simulation by utilizing the critical phenomena of condensed matter systems to probe fundamental quantum relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain symmetry aspects of non-interacting and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <title>Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Magic phase transition and non-local complexity in generalized $W$ State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Computational Order Parameters in Rydberg Atom Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph states are computationally powerful quantum states with many applications including use as resource states for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). We demonstrate construction of graph states on a Rydberg atom quantum analogue simulator. We show how an always-on interaction can be used to simultaneously entangle all Rydberg atoms into a graph state. We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters. Our results define a route to efficiently test computational power in quantum devices.</description>
