      <title>Phase-Space Shaping in Wakefield Accelerators due to Betatron Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based accelerators are beginning to employ relativistic beams with unprecedented charge and ultrashort durations. These dense driver beams can drive wakes even in high-density plasmas ($\gtrsim10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$), where betatron radiation becomes increasingly important and begins to affect the dynamics of the accelerated beam. In this Letter, we show that betatron cooling leads to a strong, structuring of the phase space of the beam. This gives rise to bunched, ring-like structures with positive radial position and momentum gradients, \emph{i.e.}, population inversion of the amplitude of oscillation. We derive the characteristic timescales for this process analytically and confirm our predictions with multi-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. The radiation-dominated regime of beam dynamics fundamentally alters the acceleration process and produces self-structured beams capable of triggering coherent betatron emission in ion channels.</description>

      <title>Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current Model for Finite Element Simulations of Rutherford Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current (DISCC) model. It is a finite element (FE) model based on a homogenization approach enabling efficient and accurate simulation of the transient magnetic response of superconducting Rutherford cables without explicitly representing individual strands. The DISCC model reproduces the inter-strand coupling current dynamics via a novel mixed FE formulation, and can be combined with the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) and Flux (ROHF) models applied at the strand level in order to reproduce the internal strand dynamics: hysteresis, eddy, and inter-filament coupling currents, as well as ohmic effects. We first analyze the performance of the DISCC model alone, as a linear problem. We then extend the analysis to include the internal strand dynamics that make the problem nonlinear. In all cases, the DISCC model offers a massive reduction of the computational time compared to conventional fully detailed FE models while still accounting for all types of loss, magnetization and inductance contributions. Rutherford cables homogenized with the DISCC model can be directly included in FE models of magnet cross-sections for efficient electro-magneto-thermal simulations of their transient response. We present two possible FE formulations for the implementation of the DISCC model, a first one based on the h-phi-formulation, and a second one based on the h-phi-a-formulation, which is well suited for an efficient treatment of the ferromagnetic regions in magnet cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Controls Abstraction Towards Accelerator Physics: A Middle Layer Python Package for Particle Accelerator Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control system middle layers act as a co-ordination and communication bridge between end users, including operators, system experts, scientists, and experimental users, and the low-level control system interface. This article describes a Python package -- Controls Abstraction Towards Acclerator Physics (CATAP) -- which aims to build on previous experience and provide a modern Python-based middle layer with explicit abstraction, YAML-based configuration, and procedural code generation. CATAP provides a structured and coherent interface to a control system, allowing researchers and operators to centralize higher-level control logic and device information. This greatly reduces the amount of code that a user must write to perform a task, and codifies system knowledge that is usually anecdotal. The CATAP design has been deployed at two accelerator facilities, and has been developed to produce a procedurally generated facility-specific middle layer package from configuration files to enable its wider dissemination across other machines.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Theory of the Ion Channel Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ion channel laser (ICL) is a plasma-based alternative to the free electron laser (FEL) that uses the electric field of a uniform-density ion channel rather than the magnetic field of an undulator to induce transverse oscillations of electrons in an ultrarelativistic bunch and thereby produce coherent radiation via a collective electromagnetic instability. The powerful focusing of the ion channel generally yields significantly higher gain parameters in the ICL as compared to the FEL. This permits lasing in extremely short distances using electron bunches with an energy spread as large as a few percent; a value readily achievable with current plasma-based accelerators. ICLs, however, impose stringent transverse phase space requirements on the electron bunch beyond what is required in FELs. In this work, we present a novel 3D theory of the planar off-axis configuration of the ICL that accounts for a number of effects including diffraction, transverse radiation profile, frequency and betatron phase detuning, and nonzero spread in energy and undulator parameter. We derive the ICL pendulum and field equations, which we use to write down the 3D Maxwell-Klimontovich equations. After linearizing, we obtain an integro-differential equation describing the $z$-evolution of the radiation field. The 3D ICL dispersion relation is obtained using a Van Kampen normal mode expansion. We numerically solve the $z$-evolution equation to compute radiation power growth rates and transverse radiation profiles over a range of different ICL parameters. We examine the gain reduction due to 3D effects, energy spread, and emittance. Electron bunch phase space and emittance requirements for lasing are derived. Finally, we make general observations about the performance and feasibility of the ICL and discuss future prospects.</description>

      <title>LLRF System Analysis for the Fermilab PIP-II Superconducting LINAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PIP-II is a superconducting linac that is in the initial acceleration chain for the Fermilab accelerator complex. The RF system consists of a warm front-end with an RFQ and buncher cavities along with 25 superconducting cryo-modules comprised of cavities with five different acceleration \(\beta\). The LLRF system for the linac has to provide field and resonance control for a total of 125 RF cavities. Various components of the LLRF system have been tested with and without beam at the PIP-II test stands. The LLRF system design is derived from the LCLS-II project with its self-excited loop architecture used in the majority of the cryo-modules. The PIP-II beam loading at 2 mA is much higher than the LCLS-II linac. The control system architecture is analyzed and evaluated for the operational limits of feedback gains and their ability to meet the project regulation requirements for cavity field amplitude and phase regulation.</description>
