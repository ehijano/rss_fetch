      <title>No Audiogram: Leveraging Existing Scores for Personalized Speech Intelligibility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones. Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score) pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support (audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility prediction.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effectiveness of Pre-Trained Audio Embeddings for Classification of Parkinson's Disease Speech Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD), motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification. Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK) and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GOP in CTC-Based Mispronunciation Detection with Phonological Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP) metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS (unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods, which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Dhvani: A Weakly-supervised Phonemic Error Detection and Personalized Feedback System for Hindi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations, and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners. While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.</description>

      <title>Towards Machine Unlearning for Paralinguistic Speech Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we pioneer the study of Machine Unlearning (MU) for Paralinguistic Speech Processing (PSP). We focus on two key PSP tasks: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Depression Detection (DD). To this end, we propose, SISA++, a novel extension to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) MU method, SISA by merging models trained on different shards with weight-averaging. With such modifications, we show that SISA++ preserves performance more in comparison to SISA after unlearning in benchmark SER (CREMA-D) and DD (E-DAIC) datasets. Also, to guide future research for easier adoption of MU for PSP, we present ``cookbook recipes'' - actionable recommendations for selecting optimal feature representations and downstream architectures that can mitigate performance degradation after the unlearning process.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Reasonable Effectiveness of Speaker Pre-Trained Models and their Synergistic Power for SingMOS Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on Singing Voice Mean Opinion Score (SingMOS) prediction. Previous research have shown the performance benefit with the use of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models (PTMs). However, they haven't explored speaker recognition speech PTMs (SPTMs) such as x-vector, ECAPA and we hypothesize that it will be the most effective for SingMOS prediction. We believe that due to their speaker recognition pre-training, it equips them to capture fine-grained vocal features (e.g., pitch, tone, intensity) from synthesized singing voices in a much more better way than other PTMs. Our experiments with SOTA PTMs including SPTMs and music PTMs validates the hypothesis. Additionally, we introduce a novel fusion framework, BATCH that uses Bhattacharya Distance for fusion of PTMs. Through BATCH with the fusion of speaker recognition SPTMs, we report the topmost performance comparison to all the individual PTMs and baseline fusion techniques as well as setting SOTA.</description>

      <title>Are Mamba-based Audio Foundation Models the Best Fit for Non-Verbal Emotion Recognition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on non-verbal vocal sounds emotion recognition (NVER). We investigate mamba-based audio foundation models (MAFMs) for the first time for NVER and hypothesize that MAFMs will outperform attention-based audio foundation models (AAFMs) for NVER by leveraging its state-space modeling to capture intrinsic emotional structures more effectively. Unlike AAFMs, which may amplify irrelevant patterns due to their attention mechanisms, MAFMs will extract more stable and context-aware representations, enabling better differentiation of subtle non-verbal emotional cues. Our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AAFMs and MAFMs validates our hypothesis. Further, motivated from related research such as speech emotion recognition, synthetic speech detection, where fusion of foundation models (FMs) have showed improved performance, we also explore fusion of FMs for NVER. To this end, we propose, RENO, that uses renyi-divergence as a novel loss function for effective alignment of the FMs. It also makes use of self-attention for better intra-representation interaction of the FMs. With RENO, through the heterogeneous fusion of MAFMs and AAFMs, we show the topmost performance in comparison to individual FMs, its fusion and also setting SOTA in comparison to previous SOTA work.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Lyrics Transcription on Music Mixtures with Consistency Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) aims to recognize lyrics from singing voices, similar to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for spoken language, but faces added complexity due to domain-specific properties of the singing voice. While foundation ASR models show robustness in various speech tasks, their performance degrades on singing voice, especially in the presence of musical accompaniment. This work focuses on this performance gap and explores Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for ALT, investigating both single-domain and dual-domain fine-tuning strategies. We propose using a consistency loss to better align vocal and mixture encoder representations, improving transcription on mixture without relying on singing voice separation. Our results show that while na\"ive dual-domain fine-tuning underperforms, structured training with consistency loss yields modest but consistent gains, demonstrating the potential of adapting ASR foundation models for music.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Differential Denoising for Respiratory Sounds Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated respiratory sound classification faces practical challenges from background noise and insufficient denoising in existing systems.
  We propose Adaptive Differential Denoising network, that integrates noise suppression and pathological feature preservation via three innovations:
  1) Adaptive Frequency Filter with learnable spectral masks and soft shrink to eliminate noise while retaining diagnostic high-frequency components;
  2) A Differential Denoise Layer using differential attention to reduce noise-induced variations through augmented sample comparisons;
  3) A bias denoising loss jointly optimizing classification and robustness without clean labels.
  Experiments on the ICBHI2017 dataset show that our method achieves 65.53\% of the Score, which is improved by 1.99\% over the previous sota method.

      <title>Prompt-Unseen-Emotion: Zero-shot Expressive Speech Synthesis with Prompt-LLM Contextual Knowledge for Mixed Emotions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose AuralNet, a novel 3D multi-source binaural sound source localization approach that localizes overlapping sources in both azimuth and elevation without prior knowledge of the number of sources. AuralNet employs a gated coarse-tofine architecture, combining a coarse classification stage with a fine-grained regression stage, allowing for flexible spatial resolution through sector partitioning. The model incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture spatial cues in binaural signals, enhancing robustness in noisy-reverberant environments. A masked multi-task loss function is designed to jointly optimize sound detection, azimuth, and elevation estimation. Extensive experiments in noisy-reverberant conditions demonstrate the superiority of AuralNet over recent methods</description>

      <title>On the influence of language similarity in non-target speaker verification trials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of language similarity in cross-lingual non-target speaker verification trials using a state-of-the-art speaker verification system, ECAPA-TDNN, trained on multilingual and monolingual variants of the VoxCeleb dataset. Our analysis of the score distribution patterns on multilingual Globalphone and LDC CTS reveals a clustering effect in speaker comparisons involving a training language, whereby the choice of comparison language only minimally impacts scores. Conversely, we observe a language similarity effect in trials involving languages not included in the training set of the speaker verification system, with scores correlating with language similarity measured by a language classification system, especially when using multilingual training data.</description>

      <title>Fast-Converging Distributed Signal Estimation in Topology-Unconstrained Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on distributed signal estimation in topology-unconstrained wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) where sensor nodes only transmit fused versions of their local sensor signals. For this task, the topology-independent (TI) distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) algorithm (TI-DANSE) has previously been proposed. It converges towards the centralized signal estimation solution in non-fully connected and time-varying network topologies. However, the applicability of TI-DANSE in real-world scenarios is limited due to its slow convergence. The latter results from the fact that, in TI-DANSE, nodes only have access to the in-network sum of all fused signals in the WASN. We address this low convergence speed by introducing an improved TI-DANSE algorithm, referred to as TI-DANSE+, in which updating nodes separately use the partial in-network sums of fused signals coming from each of their neighbors. Nodes can maximize the number of available degrees of freedom in their local optimization problem, leading to faster convergence. This is further exploited by combining TI-DANSE+ with a tree-pruning strategy that maximizes the number of neighbors at the updating node. In fully connected WASNs, TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the original DANSE algorithm (the latter only defined for fully connected WASNs) while using peer-to-peer data transmission instead of broadcasting and thus saving communication bandwidth. If link failures occur, the convergence of TI-DANSE+ towards the centralized solution is preserved without any change in its formulation. Altogether, the proposed TI-DANSE+ algorithm can be viewed as an all-round alternative to DANSE and TI-DANSE which (i) merges the advantages of both, (ii) reconciliates their differences into a single formulation, and (iii) shows advantages of its own in terms of communication bandwidth usage.</description>

      <title>CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Buffer: Online Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement with Sub-Second Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have been recently used for speech enhancement with remarkable success but are computationally expensive at inference time. Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.</description>

      <title>PartialEdit: Identifying Partial Deepfakes in the Era of Neural Speech Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech editing enables seamless partial edits to speech utterances, allowing modifications to selected content while preserving the rest of the audio unchanged. This useful technique, however, also poses new risks of deepfakes. To encourage research on detecting such partially edited deepfake speech, we introduce PartialEdit, a deepfake speech dataset curated using advanced neural editing techniques. We explore both detection and localization tasks on PartialEdit. Our experiments reveal that models trained on the existing PartialSpoof dataset fail to detect partially edited speech generated by neural speech editing models. As recent speech editing models almost all involve neural audio codecs, we also provide insights into the artifacts the model learned on detecting these deepfakes. Further information about the PartialEdit dataset and audio samples can be found on the project page: https://yzyouzhang.com/PartialEdit/index.html.</description>

      <title>InfiniteAudio: Infinite-Length Audio Generation with Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents InfiniteAudio, a simple yet effective strategy for generating infinite-length audio using diffusion-based text-to-audio methods. Current approaches face memory constraints because the output size increases with input length, making long duration generation challenging. A common workaround is to concatenate short audio segments, but this often leads to inconsistencies due to the lack of shared temporal context. To address this, InfiniteAudio integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines without additional training. It introduces two key techniques: FIFO sampling, a first-in, first-out inference strategy with fixed-size inputs, and curved denoising, which selectively prioritizes key diffusion steps for efficiency. Experiments show that InfiniteAudio achieves comparable or superior performance across all metrics. Audio samples are available on our project page.</description>

      <title>DYNAC: Dynamic Vocabulary based Non-Autoregressive Contextualization for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models. This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens. This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.</description>

      <title>Inter(sectional) Alia(s): Ambiguity in Voice Agent Identity via Intersectional Japanese Self-Referents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents. Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering, i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories, especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work on voice agents.</description>

      <title>CNVSRC 2024: The Second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the second Chinese Continuous Visual Speech Recognition Challenge (CNVSRC 2024), which builds on CNVSRC 2023 to advance research in Chinese Large Vocabulary Continuous Visual Speech Recognition (LVC-VSR). The challenge evaluates two test scenarios: reading in recording studios and Internet speech. CNVSRC 2024 uses the same datasets as its predecessor CNVSRC 2023, which involves CN-CVS for training and CNVSRC-Single/Multi for development and evaluation. However, CNVSRC 2024 introduced two key improvements: (1) a stronger baseline system, and (2) an additional dataset, CN-CVS2-P1, for open tracks to improve data volume and diversity. The new challenge has demonstrated several important innovations in data preprocessing, feature extraction, model design, and training strategies, further pushing the state-of-the-art in Chinese LVC-VSR. More details and resources are available at the official website.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models in Visual Speech Recognition: Model Scaling, Context-Aware Decoding, and Iterative Polishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) transcribes speech by analyzing lip movements. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into VSR systems, leading to notable performance improvements. However, the potential of LLMs has not been extensively studied, and how to effectively utilize LLMs in VSR tasks remains unexplored. This paper systematically explores how to better leverage LLMs for VSR tasks and provides three key contributions: (1) Scaling Test: We study how the LLM size affects VSR performance, confirming a scaling law in the VSR task. (2) Context-Aware Decoding: We add contextual text to guide the LLM decoding, improving recognition accuracy. (3) Iterative Polishing: We propose iteratively refining LLM outputs, progressively reducing recognition errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by these designs, the great potential of LLMs can be largely harnessed, leading to significant VSR performance improvement.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Audio Deepfake Origins: A Deep Metric learning And Conformer Network Approach With Ensemble Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline system.</description>

Abstract: As the accessibility and ease-of-use of digital audio workstations increases, so does the quantity of music available to the average listener; additionally, differences between genres are not always well defined and can be abstract, with widely varying combinations of genres across individual records. In this article, multiple preprocessing methods and approaches to model training are described and compared, accounting for the eclectic nature of today's albums. A custom, manually labeled dataset of more than 18000 entries has been used to perform the experiments.</description>

      <title>HENT-SRT: Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer with Self-Distillation for Joint Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural transducers (NT) provide an effective framework for speech streaming, demonstrating strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, the application of NT to speech translation (ST) remains challenging, as existing approaches struggle with word reordering and performance degradation when jointly modeling ASR and ST, resulting in a gap with attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) models. Existing NT-based ST approaches also suffer from high computational training costs. To address these issues, we propose HENT-SRT (Hierarchical Efficient Neural Transducer for Speech Recognition and Translation), a novel framework that factorizes ASR and translation tasks to better handle reordering. To ensure robust ST while preserving ASR performance, we use self-distillation with CTC consistency regularization. Moreover, we improve computational efficiency by incorporating best practices from ASR transducers, including a down-sampled hierarchical encoder, a stateless predictor, and a pruned transducer loss to reduce training complexity. Finally, we introduce a blank penalty during decoding, reducing deletions and improving translation quality. Our approach is evaluated on three conversational datasets Arabic, Spanish, and Mandarin achieving new state-of-the-art performance among NT models and substantially narrowing the gap with AED-based systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In emotion recognition from speech, a key challenge lies in identifying speech signal segments that carry the most relevant acoustic variations for discerning specific emotions. Traditional approaches compute functionals for features such as energy and F0 over entire sentences or longer speech portions, potentially missing essential fine-grained variation in the long-form statistics. This research investigates the use of word informativeness, derived from a pre-trained language model, to identify semantically important segments. Acoustic features are then computed exclusively for these identified segments, enhancing emotion recognition accuracy. The methodology utilizes standard acoustic prosodic features, their functionals, and self-supervised representations. Results indicate a notable improvement in recognition performance when features are computed on segments selected based on word informativeness, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the prosodic characteristics associated with winning and losing in post-match tennis interviews. Additionally, this research explores the potential to classify match outcomes solely based on post-match interview recordings using prosodic features and self-supervised learning (SSL) representations. By analyzing prosodic elements such as pitch and intensity, alongside SSL models like Wav2Vec 2.0 and HuBERT, the aim is to determine whether an athlete has won or lost their match. Traditional acoustic features and deep speech representations are extracted from the data, and machine learning classifiers are employed to distinguish between winning and losing players. Results indicate that SSL representations effectively differentiate between winning and losing outcomes, capturing subtle speech patterns linked to emotional states. At the same time, prosodic cues -- such as pitch variability -- remain strong indicators of victory.</description>

      <title>Trusted Fake Audio Detection Based on Dirichlet Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the continuous development of deep learning-based speech conversion and speech synthesis technologies, the cybersecurity problem posed by fake audio has become increasingly serious. Previously proposed models for defending against fake audio have attained remarkable performance. However, they all fall short in modeling the trustworthiness of the decisions made by the models themselves. Based on this, we put forward a plausible fake audio detection approach based on the Dirichlet distribution with the aim of enhancing the reliability of fake audio detection. Specifically, we first generate evidence through a neural network. Uncertainty is then modeled using the Dirichlet distribution. By modeling the belief distribution with the parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, an estimate of uncertainty can be obtained for each decision. Finally, the predicted probabilities and corresponding uncertainty estimates are combined to form the final opinion. On the ASVspoof series dataset (i.e., ASVspoof 2019 LA, ASVspoof 2021 LA, and DF), we conduct a number of comparison experiments to verify the excellent performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>StarVC: A Unified Auto-Regressive Framework for Joint Text and Speech Generation in Voice Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice Conversion (VC) modifies speech to match a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Traditional methods usually extract speaker information directly from speech while neglecting the explicit utilization of linguistic content. Since VC fundamentally involves disentangling speaker identity from linguistic content, leveraging structured semantic features could enhance conversion performance. However, previous attempts to incorporate semantic features into VC have shown limited effectiveness, motivating the integration of explicit text modeling. We propose StarVC, a unified autoregressive VC framework that first predicts text tokens before synthesizing acoustic features. The experiments demonstrate that StarVC outperforms conventional VC methods in preserving both linguistic content (i.e., WER and CER) and speaker characteristics (i.e., SECS and MOS). Audio demo can be found at: https://thuhcsi.github.io/StarVC/.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Barriers of Text-Hungry and Audio-Deficient AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While global linguistic diversity spans more than 7164 recognized languages, the current dominant architecture of machine intelligence remains fundamentally biased toward written text. This bias excludes over 700 million people particularly in rural and remote regions who are audio-literate. In this work, we introduce a fully textless, audio-to-audio machine intelligence framework designed to serve this underserved population, and all the people who prefer audio-efficiency. Our contributions include novel Audio-to-Audio translation architectures that bypass text entirely, including spectrogram-, scalogram-, wavelet-, and unit-based models. Central to our approach is the Multiscale Audio-Semantic Transform (MAST), a representation that encodes tonal, prosodic, speaker, and expressive features. We further integrate MAST into a fractional diffusion of mean-field-type framework powered by fractional Brownian motion. It enables the generation of high-fidelity, semantically consistent speech without reliance on textual supervision. The result is a robust and scalable system capable of learning directly from raw audio, even in languages that are unwritten or rarely digitized. This work represents a fundamental shift toward audio-native machine intelligence systems, expanding access to language technologies for communities historically left out of the current machine intelligence ecosystem.</description>

      <title>SOVA-Bench: Benchmarking the Speech Conversation Ability for LLM-based Voice Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the steady progress of large language models (LLMs), speech encoding algorithms and vocoder structure, recent advancements have enabled generating speech response directly from a user instruction. However, benchmarking the generated speech quality has been a neglected but critical issue, considering the shift from the pursuit of semantic accuracy to vivid and spontaneous speech flow. Previous evaluation focused on the speech-understanding ability, lacking a quantification of acoustic quality. In this paper, we propose Speech cOnversational Voice Assistant Benchmark (SOVA-Bench), providing a comprehension comparison of the general knowledge, speech recognition and understanding, along with both semantic and acoustic generative ability between available speech LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, SOVA-Bench is one of the most systematic evaluation frameworks for speech LLMs, inspiring the direction of voice interaction systems.</description>

      <title>DnR-nonverbal: Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset Containing Non-Verbal Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new dataset for cinematic audio source separation (CASS) that handles non-verbal sounds. Existing CASS datasets only contain reading-style sounds as a speech stem. These datasets differ from actual movie audio, which is more likely to include acted-out voices. Consequently, models trained on conventional datasets tend to have issues where emotionally heightened voices, such as laughter and screams, are more easily separated as an effect, not speech. To address this problem, we build a new dataset, DnR-nonverbal. The proposed dataset includes non-verbal sounds like laughter and screams in the speech stem. From the experiments, we reveal the issue of non-verbal sound extraction by the current CASS model and show that our dataset can effectively address the issue in the synthetic and actual movie audio. Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15470640.</description>

      <title>On the Language and Gender Biases in PSTN, VoIP and Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing focus on fairness and inclusivity within speech technology, particularly in areas such as automatic speech recognition and speech sentiment analysis. When audio is transcoded prior to processing, as is the case in streaming or real-time applications, any inherent bias in the coding mechanism may result in disparities. This not only affects user experience but can also have broader societal implications by perpetuating stereotypes and exclusion. Thus, it is important that audio coding mechanisms are unbiased. In this work, we contribute towards the scarce research with respect to language and gender biases of audio codecs. By analyzing the speech quality of over 2 million multilingual audio files after transcoding through a representative subset of codecs (PSTN, VoIP and neural), our results indicate that PSTN codecs are strongly biased in terms of gender and that neural codecs introduce language biases.</description>

      <title>Prosodic Structure Beyond Lexical Content: A Study of Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.</description>

      <title>Speaker Diarization with Overlapping Community Detection Using Graph Attention Networks and Label Propagation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm (OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07% with oracle VAD.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Data Scarcity in Multi-Dialectal Arabic ASR via Whisper Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although commercial Arabic automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems support Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), they struggle with dialectal speech. We investigate the effect of fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper on five major Arabic dialects (Gulf, Levantine, Iraqi, Egyptian, Maghrebi) using Mozilla Common Voice for MSA and the MASC dataset for dialectal speech. We evaluate MSA training size effects, benefits of pre-training on MSA data, and dialect-specific versus dialect-pooled models. We find that small amounts of MSA fine-tuning data yield substantial improvements for smaller models, matching larger non-fine-tuned models. While MSA pre-training shows minimal benefit, suggesting limited shared features between MSA and dialects, our dialect-pooled models perform comparably to dialect-specific ones. This indicates that pooling dialectal data, when properly balanced, can help address data scarcity in low-resource ASR without significant performance loss.</description>

      <title>MotionRAG-Diff: A Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Framework for Long-Term Music-to-Dance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating long-term, coherent, and realistic music-conditioned dance sequences remains a challenging task in human motion synthesis. Existing approaches exhibit critical limitations: motion graph methods rely on fixed template libraries, restricting creative generation; diffusion models, while capable of producing novel motions, often lack temporal coherence and musical alignment. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{MotionRAG-Diff}$, a hybrid framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with diffusion-based refinement to enable high-quality, musically coherent dance generation for arbitrary long-term music inputs. Our method introduces three core innovations: (1) A cross-modal contrastive learning architecture that aligns heterogeneous music and dance representations in a shared latent space, establishing unsupervised semantic correspondence without paired data; (2) An optimized motion graph system for efficient retrieval and seamless concatenation of motion segments, ensuring realism and temporal coherence across long sequences; (3) A multi-condition diffusion model that jointly conditions on raw music signals and contrastive features to enhance motion quality and global synchronization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionRAG-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion quality, diversity, and music-motion synchronization accuracy. This work establishes a new paradigm for music-driven dance generation by synergizing retrieval-based template fidelity with diffusion-based creative enhancement.</description>

      <title>UltrasonicSpheres: Localized, Multi-Channel Sound Spheres Using Off-the-Shelf Speakers and Earables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a demo ofUltrasonicSpheres, a novel system for location-specific audio delivery using wearable earphones that decode ultrasonic signals into audible sound. Unlike conventional beamforming setups, UltrasonicSpheres relies on single ultrasonic speakers to broadcast localized audio with multiple channels, each encoded on a distinct ultrasonic carrier frequency. Users wearing our acoustically transparent earphones can demodulate their selected stream, such as exhibit narrations in a chosen language, while remaining fully aware of ambient environmental sounds. The experience preserves spatial audio perception, giving the impression that the sound originates directly from the physical location of the source. This enables personalized, localized audio without requiring pairing, tracking, or additional infrastructure. Importantly, visitors not equipped with the earphones are unaffected, as the ultrasonic signals are inaudible to the human ear. Our demo invites participants to explore multiple co-located audio zones and experience how UltrasonicSpheres supports unobtrusive delivery of personalized sound in public spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Germany has a diverse landscape of dialects, they are underrepresented in current automatic speech recognition (ASR) research. To enable studies of how robust models are towards dialectal variation, we present Betthupferl, an evaluation dataset containing four hours of read speech in three dialect groups spoken in Southeast Germany (Franconian, Bavarian, Alemannic), and half an hour of Standard German speech. We provide both dialectal and Standard German transcriptions, and analyze the linguistic differences between them. We benchmark several multilingual state-of-the-art ASR models on speech translation into Standard German, and find differences between how much the output resembles the dialectal vs. standardized transcriptions. Qualitative error analyses of the best ASR model reveal that it sometimes normalizes grammatical differences, but often stays closer to the dialectal constructions.</description>

      <title>Towards a Japanese Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems, which can model simultaneous bidirectional features of human conversations such as speech overlaps and backchannels, have attracted significant attention recently. However, the study of full-duplex spoken dialogue systems for the Japanese language has been limited, and the research on their development in Japanese remains scarce. In this paper, we present the first publicly available full-duplex spoken dialogue model in Japanese, which is built upon Moshi, a full-duplex dialogue model in English. Our model is trained through a two-stage process: pre-training on a large-scale spoken dialogue data in Japanese, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality stereo spoken dialogue data. We further enhance the model's performance by incorporating synthetic dialogue data generated by a multi-stream text-to-speech system. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the trained model outperforms Japanese baseline models in both naturalness and meaningfulness.</description>

      <title>FlashAudio: Rectified Flows for Fast and High-Fidelity Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have markedly enhanced text-to-audio generation, yet their iterative sampling processes impose substantial computational demands, limiting practical deployment. While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment. Furthermore, to address the amplified accumulation error caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG), we propose Anchored Optimization, which refines the guidance scale by anchoring it to a reference trajectory. Experimental results on text-to-audio generation demonstrate that FlashAudio's one-step generation performance surpasses the diffusion-based models with hundreds of sampling steps on audio quality and enables a sampling speed of 400x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU. Code will be available at https://github.com/liuhuadai/FlashAudio.</description>

      <title>Score-informed Music Source Separation: Improving Synthetic-to-real Generalization in Classical Music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music source separation is the task of separating a mixture of instruments into constituent tracks. Music source separation models are typically trained using only audio data, although additional information can be used to improve the model's separation capability. In this paper, we propose two ways of using musical scores to aid music source separation: a score-informed model where the score is concatenated with the magnitude spectrogram of the audio mixture as the input of the model, and a model where we use only the score to calculate the separation mask. We train our models on synthetic data in the SynthSOD dataset and evaluate our methods on the URMP and Aalto anechoic orchestra datasets, comprised of real recordings. The score-informed model improves separation results compared to a baseline approach, but struggles to generalize from synthetic to real data, whereas the score-only model shows a clear improvement in synthetic-to-real generalization.</description>

      <title>OmniAudio: Generating Spatial Audio from 360-Degree Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional video-to-audio generation techniques primarily focus on perspective video and non-spatial audio, often missing the spatial cues necessary for accurately representing sound sources in 3D environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and perspective video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/liuhuadai/OmniAudio. The project website is available at https://OmniAudio-360V2SA.github.io.</description>

      <title>Effect of laboratory conditions on the perception of virtual stages for music</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript presents initial findings critical for supporting augmented acoustics experiments in custom-made hearing booths, addressing a key challenge in ensuring perceptual validity and experimental rigor in these highly sensitive setups. This validation ensures our proposed methodology is sound, guarantees the reliability of future results, and lays the foundational groundwork for subsequent perceptual studies and the development of robust guidelines for laboratory design in virtual acoustics research. A preliminary study on the effect of the acoustical conditions of three different rooms on the perception of virtual stages for music is presented: an anechoic room, a custom-made hearing booth with insufficient sound absorption, and another custom-made hearing booth with achievable sound absorption. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of these different conditions on the perception of virtual stages for music. The results show that the anechoic room and the hearing booth with achievable sound absorption have a difference between the total sound and the virtual sound below the just-noticeable difference, which means that the virtual sound is not perceived louder than it should. In contrast, the hearing booth with insufficient sound absorption has a difference above the just-noticeable difference, which means that the virtual sound is perceived louder than it should. This study provides a preliminary validation of the proposed methodology for assessing the acoustical conditions of custom-made hearing booths in stage acoustics experiments. Future work will include a more comprehensive analysis of the results, including the effect of different sound sources.

      <title>Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal Language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts, pushing the frontiers of the omni-modal language model to a large extent. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of architectural design, data curation, and training strategies essential for building a robust omni-modal model. Ola incorporates advanced visual understanding and audio recognition capabilities through several critical and effective improvements over mainstream baselines. Moreover, we rethink inter-modal relationships during omni-modal training, emphasizing cross-modal alignment with video as a central bridge, and propose a progressive training pipeline that begins with the most distinct modalities and gradually moves towards closer modality alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</description>

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Autoregressive Speech Synthesis Inference With Speech Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15380</link>

Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of 1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model while accelerating inference.</description>

      <title>Improving Multilingual Speech Models on ML-SUPERB 2.0: Fine-tuning with Data Augmentation and LID-Aware CTC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.</description>

      <title>Continual Speech Learning with Fused Speech Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks, demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.</description>

      <title>Datasheets Aren't Enough: DataRubrics for Automated Quality Metrics and Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties. While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic, rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at https://github.com/datarubrics/datarubrics.</description>
