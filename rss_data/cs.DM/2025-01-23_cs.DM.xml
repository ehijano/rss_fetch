      <title>Degree-Based Logical Adjacency Checking (DBLAC): A Novel Heuristic for Vertex Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degree Based Logical Adjacency Checking (DBLAC). An efficient coloring of graphs with unique logical AND operations. The logical AND operation shows more effective color assignment and fewer number of induced colors in the case of common edges between vertices. In this work, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of DBLAC's time and space complexity. It furthermore shows its effectiveness through prolonged experiments on standard benchmark graphs. We compare it with existing algorithms, namely DSATUR and Recursive Largest First (RLF). Second, we show how DBLAC achieves competitive results with respect to both the number of colors used and runtime performance.</description>

      <title>An O(log n)-Approximation Algorithm for (p,q)-Flexible Graph Connectivity via Independent Rounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $(p,q)$-Flexible Graph Connectivity problem, the input is a graph $G = (V,E)$ with the edge set $E = \mathscr{S} \cup \mathscr{U}$ partitioned into safe and unsafe edges, and the goal is to find a minimum cost set of edges $F$ such that the subgraph $(V,F)$ remains $p$-edge-connected after removing any $q$ unsafe edges from $F$. We give a new integer programming formulation for the problem, by adding knapsack cover constraints to the $p(p+q)$-connected capacitated edge-connectivity formulation studied in previous work, and show that the corresponding linear relaxation can be solved in polynomial time by giving an efficient separation oracle. Further, we show that independent randomized rounding yields an $O(\log n)$-approximation for arbitrary values of $p$ and $q$, improving the state-of-the-art $O(q\log n)$. For both separation and rounding, a key insight is to use Karger's bound on the number of near-minimum cuts.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Sets for 12 Cards is 14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel proof that the maximum number of sets with 4 properties for 12 cards is 14 using the geometry of the finite field F_3^4, number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. We also present several computer algorithms for finding the maximum number of sets. In particular, we show a complete set solver that iterates over all possible board configurations. We use this method to compute the maximum number of sets with 4 properties for a small number of cards, but it is generally too inefficient. However, with this method, we compute the maximum number of sets for 3 properties for all possible numbers of cards. We also present an algorithm for constructing near-optimal maximum sets.</description>

      <title>Non-adaptive Learning of Random Hypergraphs with Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a hidden hypergraph $G=(V,E)$ by making a single batch of queries (non-adaptively). We consider the hyperedge detection model, in which every query must be of the form:
  ``Does this set $S\subseteq V$ contain at least one full hyperedge?''
  In this model, it is known that there is no algorithm that allows to non-adaptively learn arbitrary hypergraphs by making fewer than $\Omega(\min\{m^2\log n, n^2\})$ even when the hypergraph is constrained to be $2$-uniform (i.e. the hypergraph is simply a graph). Recently, Li et al. overcame this lower bound in the setting in which $G$ is a graph by assuming that the graph learned is sampled from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We generalize the result of Li et al. to the setting of random $k$-uniform hypergraphs. To achieve this result, we leverage a novel equivalence between the problem of learning a single hyperedge and the standard group testing problem. This latter result may also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Group Testing in Presence of Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study in group testing aims to develop strategies to identify a small set of defective items among a large population using a few pooled tests. The established techniques have been highly beneficial in a broad spectrum of applications ranging from channel communication to identifying COVID-19-infected individuals efficiently. Despite significant research on group testing and its variants since the 1940s, testing strategies robust to deletion noise have yet to be studied. Many practical systems exhibit deletion errors, for instance, in wireless communication and data storage systems. Such deletions of test outcomes lead to asynchrony between the tests, which the current group testing strategies cannot handle. In this work, we initiate the study of non-adaptive group testing strategies resilient to deletion noise. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions to successfully identify the defective items even after the adversarial deletion of certain test outputs. We also provide constructions of testing matrices along with an efficient recovery algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Electrical Networks and their Application to Exponential Speedups for Graph Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07372v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Apers and Piddock [TQC '23] strengthened the connection between quantum walks and electrical networks via Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law. In this work, we develop a new multidimensional electrical network by defining Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law based on the multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. In analogy to the connection between the incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Alternative Kirchhoff's Law and Alternative Ohm's Law. This new framework enables generating an alternative electrical flow over the edges on graphs, which has the potential to be applied to a broader range of graph problems, benefiting both quantum and classical algorithm design.
  We first use this framework to generate quantum alternative electrical flow states and use it to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree graph by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis.
  Furthermore, this framework also allows us to demonstrate an exponential quantum speedup for the pathfinding problem in a type of regular graph, which we name the welded tree circuit graph. The exponential quantum advantage is obtained by efficiently generating quantum alternative electrical flow states and then sampling from them to find an s-t path in the welded tree circuit graph. By comparison, Li [arXiv '23] constructed a non-regular graph based on welded trees and used the degree information to achieve a similar speedup.</description>

      <title>Generalising the maximum independent set algorithm via Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph starts with the empty set and visits every vertex, adding it to the set if and only if none of its neighbours are already in the set. In this paper, we consider (the complexity of decision problems related to) the generalisation of this MIS algorithm wherein any starting set is allowed. Two main approaches are leveraged. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network according to a permutation of the vertex set. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a constituency of a graph: a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Recognizing a constituency is NP-complete, a fact we leverage repeatedly in our investigation.
  Our contributions are multiple: we establish that deciding whether all maximal independent sets can be reached from some configuration is coNP-complete; that fixing words (which reach a MIS from any starting configuration) and fixing permutations (briefly, permises) are coNP-complete to recognize; and that permissible graphs (graphs with a permis) are coNP-hard to recognize. We also exhibit large classes of permissible and non-permissible graphs, notably near-comparability graphs which may be of independent interest.
  Lastly, we extend our study to digraphs, where we search for kernels. Since the natural generalisation of our approach may not necessarily find a kernel, we introduce two further Boolean networks for digraphs: one always finds an independent set, and the other always finds a dominating set.</description>

      <title>Complexity of polytope diameters via perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>About almost covering subsets of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>Noisy Nonadaptive Group Testing with Binary Splitting: New Test Design and Improvement on Price-Scarlett-Tan's Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Group Testing, the objective is to identify $K$ defective items out of $N$, $K\ll N$, by testing pools of items together and using the least amount of tests possible. Recently, a fast decoding method based on binary splitting (Price and Scarlett, 2020) has been proposed that simultaneously achieve optimal number of tests and decoding complexity for Non-Adaptive Probabilistic Group Testing (NAPGT). However, the method works only when the test results are noiseless. In this paper, we further study the binary splitting method and propose (1) A NAPGT scheme that generalizes the original binary splitting method from the noiseless case into tests with $\rho$ proportion of false positives (the $\rho$-False Positive Channel), where $\rho$ is a constant, with asymptotically-optimal number of tests and decoding complexity, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(K\log N)$, and (2) A NAPGT scheme in the presence of both false positives and false negatives in test outcomes, improving and generalizing the work of Price, Scarlett and Tan~\cite{price2023fast} in two ways: First, under $\rho$-proportion of test results flipped ($\rho$-Binary Symmetric Channel) and within the general sublinear regime $K=\Theta(N^\alpha)$ where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, our algorithm has a decoding complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2}K^{1+\epsilon})$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is a constant parameter. Second, when the false negative flipping probability $\rho'$ satisfies $\rho'=\mathcal{O}(K^{-\epsilon})$ and the false positive flipping probability $\rho$ is a constant, we can simultaneously achieve $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}K\log N)$ for both the number of tests and the decoding complexity. It remains open to achieve these optimals under the general BSC.</description>

      <title>On the matching arrangement of a graph, improper weight function problem and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents examples of an application of the finite field method for the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the matching arrangement of a graph. Weight functions on edges of a graph with weights from a finite field are divided into proper and improper functions in connection with proper colorings of vertices of the matching polytope of a graph. An improper weight function problem is introduced, a proof of its NP-completeness is presented, and a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem is constructed based on the improper weight function problem.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary $O(1)$ operations on recursive lists. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. While permutations are generated in an unusual order, the transitions between consecutive permutations remain smooth. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>On the thinness of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of structural graph width parameters like tree-width, clique-width and rank-width has been ongoing during the last five decades, and their algorithmic use has also been increasing [Cygan et al., 2015]. New width parameters continue to be defined, for example, MIM-width in 2012, twin-width in 2020, and mixed-thinness, a generalization of thinness, in 2022.
  The concept of thinness of a graph was introduced in 2007 by Mannino, Oriolo, Ricci and Chandran, and it can be seen as a generalization of interval graphs, which are exactly the graphs with thinness equal to one. This concept is interesting because if a representation of a graph as a $k$-thin graph is given for a constant value $k$, then several known NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time. Some examples are the maximum weighted independent set problem, solved in the seminal paper by Mannino et al., and the capacitated coloring with fixed number of colors [Bonomo, Mattia and Oriolo, 2011].
  In this work we present a constructive $O(n\log(n))$-time algorithm to compute the thinness for any given $n$-vertex tree, along with a corresponding thin representation. We use intermediate results of this construction to improve known bounds of the thinness of some special families of trees.</description>
