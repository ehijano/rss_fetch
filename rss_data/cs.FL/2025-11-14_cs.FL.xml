      <title>Spectral and combinatorial methods for efficiently computing the rank of unambiguous finite automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A zero-one matrix is a matrix with entries from $\{0, 1\}$. We study monoids containing only such matrices. A finite set of zero-one matrices generating such a monoid can be seen as the matrix representation of an unambiguous finite automaton, an important generalisation of deterministic finite automata which shares many of their good properties.
  Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite set of $n \times n$ zero-one matrices generating a monoid of zero-one matrices, and $m$ be the cardinality of $\mathcal{A}$. We study the computational complexity of computing the minimum rank of a matrix in the monoid generated by $\mathcal{A}$. By using linear-algebraic techniques, we show that this problem is in $\textsf{NC}$ and can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(mn^4)$ time. We also provide a combinatorial algorithm finding a matrix of minimum rank in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2 + \omega} + mn^4)$ time, where $2 \le \omega \le 2.4$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. As a byproduct, we show a very weak version of a generalisation of the \v{C}ern\'{y} conjecture: there always exists a straight line program of size $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ describing a product resulting in a matrix of minimum rank.
  For the special case corresponding to total DFAs (that is, for the case where all matrices have exactly one 1 in each row), the minimum rank is the size of the smallest image of the set of all states under the action of a word. Our combinatorial algorithm finds a matrix of minimum rank in time $\mathcal{O}(n^3 + mn^2)$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</description>

      <title>Unique Hard Attention: A Tale of Two Sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention -- in that case, they correspond to a \emph{strictly weaker} fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to \emph{soft} attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality.</description>
