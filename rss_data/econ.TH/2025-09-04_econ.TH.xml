      <title>Mutual Reputation and Trust in a Repeated Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a repeated sender-receiver game where inspections are public but the sender's action is hidden unless inspected. A detected deception ends the relationship or triggers a finite punishment. We show the public state is one dimensional and prove existence of a stationary equilibrium with cutoff inspection and monotone deception. The sender's mixing pins down a closed-form total inspection probability at the cutoff, and a finite punishment phase implements the same cutoffs as termination. We extend to noisy checks, silent audits, and rare public alarms, preserving the Markov structure and continuity as transparency vanishes or becomes full. The model yields testable implications for auditing, certification, and platform governance: tapering inspections with reputation, bunching of terminations after inspection spurts, and sharper cutoffs as temptation rises relative to costs.</description>

      <title>Reputational Conservatism in Expert Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study expert recommendations under career concerns in a continuous signal environment. An expert observes a private signal about a binary payoff and recommends risky or safe; recommendations and outcomes are public and affect reputation and implementation. Equilibrium advice follows a cutoff rule. Under a mild relative-diagnosticity condition, the cutoff increases with reputation (reputational conservatism); informativeness and priors lower the cutoff while stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus provides a one-to-one mapping to experimentation. The theory predicts fewer risky recommendations but higher conditional hit rates for high-reputation experts and yields implementable levers for committees and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Reputation, Risk, and Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When does reputation make experts play it safe, and what policy reverses that? I isolate a single lever - visibility of outcomes. In a two-page model with binary signals and outcomes, I show: (i) with an uninformative safe option and symmetric visibility, career concerns alone do not generate conservatism; (ii) increasing failure visibility (as in Registered Reports) weakens high-reputation caution and relaxes selection. I provide a necessary-and-sufficient local sign test, agnostic about utility curvature and allowing informative safe actions, and an identification map suitable for staggered RR adoption.</description>

      <title>Consumer Welfare Under Individual Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01231v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric method for estimating the distribution of consumer welfare from cross-sectional data with no restrictions on individual preferences. First demonstrating that moments of demand identify the curvature of the expenditure function, we use these moments to approximate money-metric welfare measures. Our approach captures both nonhomotheticity and heterogeneity in preferences in the behavioral responses to price changes. We apply our method to US household scanner data to evaluate the impacts of the price shock between December 2020 and 2021 on the cost-of-living index. We document substantial heterogeneity in welfare losses within and across demographic groups. For most groups, a naive measure of consumer welfare would significantly underestimate the welfare loss. By decomposing the behavioral responses into the components arising from nonhomotheticity and heterogeneity in preferences, we find that both factors are essential for accurate welfare measurement, with heterogeneity contributing more substantially.</description>

      <title>How to Segment a Search Market: Information Design and Directed Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines when the public provision of information in search markets improves welfare. I consider a two-sided frictional search market in which buyers match with vertically differentiated sellers. The market is segmented into submarkets based on seller types. Such segmentation serves as a public signal that buyers use to direct their search. Given a segmentation, I characterize both the socially efficient and the equilibrium allocation of buyers across submarkets, and identify a Hosios-type condition under which the equilibrium allocation is efficient. I then analyze the design of surplus-maximizing segmentations, showing that the nature of search externalities determines when the constrained-efficient segmentation fully separates seller types or pools them into at most a binary partition.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-parametric methodology to quantify preference heterogeneity in consumer choices. By repeatedly sampling individual observations and partitioning agents into groups consistent with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), we construct a similarity matrix capturing latent preference structures. Under mild assumptions, this matrix consistently and asymptotically normally estimates the probability that any pair of agents share a common utility function. Leveraging this, we develop hypothesis tests to assess whether demographic characteristics systematically explain unobserved heterogeneity. Simulations confirm the test's validity, and we apply the method to a standard grocery expenditure dataset.</description>

      <title>Visibly Fair Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Priority-based allocation of individuals to positions are pervasive, and elimination of justified envy is often, an absolute requirement. This leaves serial dictatorship (SD) as the only rule that avoids justified envy under standard direct mechanisms. What if SD outcomes are undesirable from a designer's perspective? We propose visible fairness, which demands fairness relative to the (potentially purposefully incomplete) preference information the mechanism elicits. Visibly fair mechanisms generalize SD; we fully characterize them and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for strategy-proofness. We show how to apply these results to design strategy-proof visibly fair rules that satisfy a broad class of distributional objectives. Visible fairness, however, results in a new information-efficiency trade-off: meeting distributional goals leads to the avoidance of eliciation of information about preferences that could prevent inefficiencies.</description>

      <title>Risky Advice and Reputational Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study expert advice under reputational incentives, with sell-side equity research as the lead application. A long-lived analyst receives a continuous private signal about a binary payoff and recommends a risky (Buy) or safe action. Recommendations and outcomes are public, and clients' implementation effort depends on current reputation. In a recursive, belief-based equilibrium: (i) advice follows a cutoff in the signal; (ii) under a simple diagnosticity asymmetry, the cutoff is (weakly) increasing in reputation (reputational conservatism); and (iii) comparative statics are transparent - higher signal precision or a higher success prior lowers the cutoff, whereas stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a closed-form mapping. The model predicts that high-reputation analysts make fewer risky calls yet attain higher conditional hit rates, and it clarifies how committee thresholds and monitoring regimes shift behavior.</description>
