      <title>Deterministic approximate counting of colorings with fewer than $2\Delta$ colors via absence of zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Delta,q\geq 3$ be integers. We prove that there exists $\eta\geq 0.002$ such that if $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}\subset \mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that for each $w\in \mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on a result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\Delta$-barrier for this problem.
  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, provided $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex whose vertices are the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$. It is known that $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of points and circles when both $G$ and $H$ are cycles. We generalize this known result by showing that $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of points and circles whenever $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture by Sylwia Cichacz and Tomasz Hinc, and a related problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\Gamma$-magic rectangle set $\mathrm{MRS}_\Gamma (a, b; c)$ is a collection of $c$ arrays of size $a\times b$ whose entries are the elements of an abelian group $\Gamma$ of order $abc$, each one appearing once and in a unique array in such a way that the sum of the elements of each row is equal to a constant $\omega \in \Gamma$ and the sum of the elements of each column is equal to a constant $\delta \in \Gamma$. In this paper we provide new evidences for the validity of a conjecture proposed by Sylwia Cichacz and Tomasz Hinc on the existence of an $\mathrm{MRS}_\Gamma(a,b;c)$. We also generalize this problem, describing constructions of $\Gamma$-magic rectangle sets, whose elements are partially filled arrays.</description>

      <title>On local antimagic chromatic numbers of the join of two special families of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that null graphs and 1-regular graphs are the only regular graphs without local antimagic chromatic number. In this paper, we use matrices of size $(2m+1) \times (2k+1)$ to completely determine the local antimagic chromatic number of the join of null graphs, $O_m, m\ge 1,$ and 1-regular graphs of odd components, $(2k+1)P_2$, $k\ge 1$. Consequently, we obtained infinitely many (possibly disconnected or regular) tripartite graphs with local antimagic chromatic number 3.</description>

      <title>Functional Equations and Pole Structure of the Bartholdi Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Bartholdi zeta function on a connected simple digraph with $n_V$ vertices and $n_E$ edges. We derive a functional equation for the Bartholdi zeta function $\zeta_G(q,u)$ on a regular graph $G$ with respect to the bump parameter $u$. We also find an equivalence between the Bartholdi zeta function with a specific value of $u$ and the Ihara zeta function at $u=0$. We determine bounds of the critical strip of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ for a general graph. If $G$ is a $(t+1)$-regular graph, the bounds are saturated and $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ and $q=(t+u)^{-1}$ are the poles at the boundaries of the critical strip for $u\ne 1, -t$. When $G$ is the regular graph and the spectrum of the adjacency matrix satisfies a certain condition, $\zeta_G(q,u)$ satisfies the so-called Riemann hypothesis. For $u \ne 1$, $q=\pm(1-u)^{-1}$ are poles of $\zeta_G(q,u)$ unless $G$ is tree. Although the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ is $n_E-n_V+1$ if $u\ne u_* \equiv 1-\frac{n_E}{n_V}$, it is enhanced at $u=u_*$. In particular, if the Moore-Penrose inverse of the incidence matrix $L^+$ and the degree vector $\vec{d}$ satisfy the condition $|L^+ \vec{d}|^2\ne n_E$, the order of the pole at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ increases only by one at $u=u_*$. The order of the pole at $q=-(1-u)^{-1}$ coincides with that at $q=(1-u)^{-1}$ if $G$ is bipartite and is $n_E-n_V$ otherwise.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado sets of flags in spherical buildings II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado (EKR) sets of flags in spherical buildings. In previous work, we used the theory of buildings and Iwahori-Hecke algebras to obtain upper bounds on their size. As the next step towards the classification of the maximal EKR-sets, we describe the eigenspaces for the smallest eigenvalue of the opposition graphs. We determine their multiplicity and provide a combinatorial description of spanning sets of these subspaces, from which a complete description of the maximal Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado sets of flags may potentially be found. This was recently shown to be possible for type $A_n$, $n$ odd, by Heering, Lansdown, and the last author by making use of the current work.</description>

      <title>Vertex-critical graphs in co-gem-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$ but $\chi(G-v)&lt;k$ for all $v\in V(G)$ and $(G,H)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or $H$. We show that there are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ when $H$ is any graph of order $4$ by showing finiteness in the three remaining open cases, those are the cases when $H$ is $2P_2$, $K_3+P_1$, and $K_4$. For the first two cases we actually prove stronger results when forbidding graphs of order $5$ that contain the graphs of interest as induced subgraphs and employ a novel application of Sperner's Theorem on the number of antichains in a partially ordered set. Our result for $K_4$ uses exhaustive computer search and actually shows the stronger result that every $(\text{co-gem, }K_4)$-free graph is $4$-colourable. Our results imply the existence of simple polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide the $k$-colourability of (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ and all $H$ of order $4$ by searching the vertex-critical graphs as induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>An activities expansion of the transition polynomial of a multimatroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted transition polynomial of a multimatroid is a generalization of the Tutte polynomial. By defining the activity of a skew class with respect to a basis in a multimatroid, we obtain an activities expansion for the weighted transition polynomial. We also decompose the set of all transversals of a multimatroid as a union of subsets of transversals. Each term in the decomposition has the structure of a boolean lattice, and each transversal belongs to a number of terms depending only on the sizes of some of its skew classes. Further expressions for the transition polynomial of a multimatroid are obtained via an equivalence relation on its bases and by extending Kochol's theory of compatible sets.
  We apply our multimatroid results to obtain a result of Morse about the transition polynomial of a delta-matroid and get a partition of the boolean lattice of subsets of elements of a delta-matroid determined by the feasible sets. Finally, we describe how multimatroids arise from graphs embedded in surfaces and apply our results to obtain an activities expansion for the topological transition polynomial. Our work extends results for the Tutte polynomial of a matroid.</description>

      <title>Odd Covers of Complete Graphs and Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `odd cover number' of a complete graph is the smallest size of a family of complete bipartite graphs that covers each edge an odd number of times. For $n$ odd, Buchanan, Clifton, Culver, Nie, O'Neill, Rombach and Yin showed that the odd cover number of $K_n$ is equal to $(n+1)/2$ or $(n+3)/2$, and they conjectured that it is always $(n+1)/2$. We prove this conjecture.
  For $n$ even, Babai and Frankl showed that the odd cover number of $K_n$ is always at least $n/2$, and the above authors and Radhakrishnan, Sen and Vishwanathan gave some values of $n$ for which equality holds. We give some new examples.
  Our constructions arise from some very symmetric constructions for the corresponding problem for complete hypergraphs. Thus the odd cover number of the complete 3-graph $K_n^{(3)}$ is the smallest number of complete 3-partite 3-graphs such that each 3-set is in an odd number of them. We show that the odd cover number of $K_n^{(3)}$ is exactly $n/2$ for even $n$, and we show that for odd $n$ it is $(n-1)/2$ for infinitely many values of $n$. We also show that for $r=3$ and $r=4$ the odd cover number of $K_n^{(r)}$ is strictly less than the partition number, answering a question of Buchanan, Clifton, Culver, Nie, O'Neill, Rombach and Yin for those values of $r$.</description>

      <title>A note on semi-transitivity of Mycielski graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orientation of a graph is semi-transitive if it contains no directed cycles and has no shortcuts. An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it can be oriented in a semi-transitive manner. The class of semi-transitive graphs includes several important graph classes. The Mycielski graph of an undirected graph is a larger graph constructed in a specific manner, which maintains the property of being triangle-free but increases the chromatic number.
  In this note, we prove Hameed's conjecture, which states that the Mycielski graph of a graph $G$ is semi-transitive if and only if $G$ is a bipartite graph. Notably, our solution to the conjecture provides an alternative and shorter proof of the Hameed's result on a complete characterization of semi-transitive extended Mycielski graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose an integral expression of the Catalan numbers, based on Malmst\'en's definite-integral representation of $\ln\left[\Gamma(x)\right]$, $\Gamma$ being the usual Gamma function. The obtained expression is likely to yield new summations involving Catalan numbers or central binomial coefficients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $q=p^n$, and $D \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$. A celebrated result of McConnel states that if $D$ is a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_q^*$, and $f:\mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_q$ is a function such that $(f(x)-f(y))/(x-y) \in D$ whenever $x \neq y$, then $f(x)$ necessarily has the form $ax^{p^j}+b$. In this notes, we give a sufficient condition on $D$ to obtain the same conclusion on $f$. In particular, we show that McConnel's theorem extends if $D$ has small doubling.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the moment-angle complex $\mathcal Z_K$ corresponding to a 3-dimensional simplicial sphere $K$ has the cohomology ring isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a connected sum of products of spheres if and only if either (a) $K$ is the boundary of a 4-dimensional cross-polytope, or (b) the one-skeleton of $K$ is a chordal graph, or (c) there are only two missing edges in $K$ and they form a chordless 4-cycle. For simplicial spheres $K$ of arbitrary dimension, we obtain a sufficient condition for the ring isomorphism $H^*(\mathcal Z_K)\cong H^*(M)$ where $M$ is a connected sum of products of spheres.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians -- spherical and hyperbolic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete Laplacian on Euclidean triangulated surfaces is a well-established notion. We introduce discrete Laplacians on spherical and hyperbolic triangulated surfaces. On the one hand, our definitions are close to the Euclidean one in that the edge weights contain the cotangents of certain combinations of angles and are non-negative if and only if the triangulation is Delaunay. On the other hand, these discretizations are structure-preserving in several respects. We prove that the area of a convex polyhedron can be written in terms of the discrete spherical Laplacian of the support function, whose expression is the same as the area of a smooth convex body in terms of the usual spherical Laplacian. We show that the conformal factors of discrete conformal vector fields on a triangulated surface of curvature $k \in \{-1,1\}$ are $-2k$-eigenfunctions of our discrete Laplacians, exactly as in the smooth setting. The discrete conformality can be understood here both in the sense of the vertex scaling and in the sense of circle patterns. Finally, we connect the $-2k$-eigenfunctions to infinitesimal isometric deformations of a polyhedron inscribed into corresponding quadrics.</description>

      <title>Irreducible characters of the generalized symmetric group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies how to compute irreducible characters of the generalized symmetric group $C_k\wr{S}_n$ by iterative algorithms. After reproving the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule by vertex algebraic method, we formulate a new iterative formula for characters of the generalized symmetric group. As applications, we find a numerical relation between the character values of $C_k\wr S_n$ and modular characters of $S_{kn}$.</description>

      <title>Random Subwords and Pipe Dreams</title>

Abstract: Fix a probability $p\in(0,1)$. Let $s_i$ denote the transposition in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ that swaps $i$ and $i+1$. Given a word $\mathsf{w}$ over the alphabet $\{s_1,\ldots,s_{n-1}\}$, we can generate a random subword by independently deleting each letter of $\mathsf{w}$ with probability $1-p$. For a large class of starting words $\mathsf{w}$ -- including all alternating reduced words for the decreasing permutation -- we compute precise asymptotics (as $n\to\infty$) for the expected number of inversions of the permutation represented by the random subword. This result can also be seen as an asymptotic formula for the expected number of inversions of a permutation represented by a certain random (non-reduced) pipe dream. In the special case when $\mathsf{w}$ is the word $(s_{n-1})(s_{n-2}s_{n-1})\cdots(s_1s_2\cdots s_{n-1})$, we find that the expected number of inversions of the permutation represented by the random subword is asymptotically equal to \[\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{\frac{p}{1-p}}\,n^{3/2};\] this settles a conjecture of Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov.</description>

      <title>Refinements of degree conditions for the existence of a spanning tree without small degree stems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spanning tree of a graph without no vertices of degree $2$ is called a {\it homeomorphically irreducible spanning tree} (or a {\it HIST}) of the graph. Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson and Thomassen~[J. Graph Theory {\bf 14} (1990), 247--258] gave a minimum degree condition for the existence of a HIST, and recently, Ito and Tsuchiya~[J. Graph Theory {\bf 99} (2022), 162--170] found a sharp degree-sum condition for the existence of a HIST. In this paper, we refine these results, and extend the first one to a spanning tree in which no vertex other than the endvertices has small degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-flip-width of a graph, for $r\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$, is a graph parameter defined in terms of a variant of the cops and robber game, called a flipper game, and it was introduced by Toru\'{n}czyk [Flip-width: Cops and robber on dense graphs, FOCS 2023]. We prove that for every $r\in (\mathbb{N}\setminus \{1\})\cup \{\infty\}$, the class of graphs of $r$-flip-width at most $2$ is exactly the class of ($C_5$, bull, gem, co-gem)-free graphs, which are known as totally decomposable graphs with respect to bi-joins.</description>

      <title>Twin-width of graphs with tree-structured decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twin-width of a graph measures its distance to co-graphs and generalizes classical width concepts such as tree-width or rank-width. Since its introduction in 2020 (Bonnet et. al. 2020), a mass of new results has appeared relating twin width to group theory, model theory, combinatorial optimization, and structural graph theory.
  We take a detailed look at the interplay between the twin-width of a graph and the twin-width of its components under tree-structured decompositions: We prove that the twin-width of a graph is at most twice its strong tree-width, contrasting nicely with the result of (Bonnet and D\'epr\'es 2022), which states that twin-width can be exponential in tree-width. Further, we employ the fundamental concept from structural graph theory of decomposing a graph into highly connected components, in order to obtain an optimal linear bound on the twin-width of a graph given the widths of its biconnected components. For triconnected components we obtain a linear upper bound if we add red edges to the components indicating the splits which led to the components. Extending this approach to quasi-4-connectivity, we obtain a quadratic upper bound. Finally, we investigate how the adhesion of a tree decomposition influences the twin-width of the decomposed graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the current state of affairs in the study of thresholds and sharp thresholds in random structures on the occasion of the recent proof of the Kahn--Kalai Conjecture by Park and Pham and the fairly recent proof of the satisfiability conjecture for large $k$ by Ding, Sly, and Sun. Random discrete structures appear as fundamental objects of study in many scientific and mathematical fields including statistical physics, combinatorics, algorithms and complexity, social choice theory, coding theory, and statistics. While the models and properties of interest in these fields vary widely, much progress has been made through the development of general tools applicable to large families of models and properties all at once. Historically these tools originated to solve or make progress on specific, difficult conjectures in the areas mentioned above. We will survey recent progress on some of these hard problems and describe some challenges for the future.</description>

      <title>Seymour's second neighbourhood conjecture: random graphs and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding conjecture of Seymour states that in every oriented graph there is a vertex whose second outneighbourhood is at least as large as its outneighbourhood. In this short note we show that, for any fixed $p\in[0,1/2)$, a.a.s. every orientation of $G(n,p)$ satisfies Seymour's conjecture (as well as a related conjecture of Sullivan). This improves on a recent result of Botler, Moura and Naia. Moreover, we show that $p=1/2$ is a natural barrier for this problem, in the following sense: for any fixed $p\in(1/2,1)$, Seymour's conjecture is actually equivalent to saying that, with probability bounded away from $0$, every orientation of $G(n,p)$ satisfies Seymour's conjecture. This provides a first reduction of the problem.
  For a second reduction, we consider minimum degrees and show that, if Seymour's conjecture is false, then there must exist arbitrarily large strongly-connected counterexamples with bounded minimum outdegree. Contrasting this, we show that vertex-minimal counterexamples must have large minimum outdegree.</description>

      <title>On the Ohba Number and Generalized Ohba Numbers of Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a graph $G$ is chromatic-choosable when its list chromatic number $\chi_{\ell}(G)$ is equal to its chromatic number $\chi(G)$. Chromatic-choosability is a well-studied topic, and in fact, some of the most famous results and conjectures related to list coloring involve chromatic-choosability. In 2002 Ohba showed that for any graph $G$ there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the join of $G$ and a complete graph on at least $N$ vertices is chromatic-choosable. The Ohba number of $G$ is the smallest such $N$. In 2014, Noel suggested studying the Ohba number, $\tau_{0}(a,b)$, of complete bipartite graphs with partite sets of size $a$ and $b$. In this paper we improve a 2009 result of Allagan by showing that $\tau_{0}(2,b) = \lfloor \sqrt{b} \rfloor - 1$ for all $b \geq 2$, and we show that for $a \geq 2$, $\tau_{0}(a,b) = \Omega( \sqrt{b} )$ as $b \rightarrow \infty$. We also initiate the study of some relaxed versions of the Ohba number of a graph which we call generalized Ohba numbers. We present some upper and lower bounds of generalized Ohba numbers of complete bipartite graphs while also posing some questions.</description>

      <title>A coarse Tutte polynomial for hypermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an analogue of the Tutte polynomial for hypermaps. This polynomial can be defined as either a sum over subhypermaps, or recursively through deletion-contraction reductions where the terminal forms consist of isolated vertices. Our Tutte polynomial extends the classical Tutte polynomial of a graph as well as the Tutte polynomial of an embedded graph (i.e., the ribbon graph polynomial), and it is a specialization of the transition polynomial via a medial map transformation. We give hypermap duality and partial duality identities for our polynomial, as well as some evaluations, and examine relations between our polynomial and other hypermap polynomials.</description>

      <title>Kohayakawa-Nagle-R{\"o}dl-Schacht conjecture for subdivisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-known Kohayakawa-Nagle-R{\"o}dl-Schacht (KNRS) conjecture, with a specific focus on graph subdivisions. The KNRS conjecture asserts that for any graph $H$, locally dense graphs contain asymptotically at least the number of copies of $H$ found in a random graph with the same edge density. We prove the following results about $k$-subdivisions of graphs (obtained by replacing edges with paths of length $k+1$): (1). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $(2k-1)$-subdivision satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, extending a prior result of Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee; (2). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $2k$-subdivision satisfies a constant-fraction version of the KNRS conjecture; (3). If $H$ is regular and satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its $2k$-subdivision also satisfies the KNRS conjecture. These findings imply that all balanced subdivisions of cliques satisfy the KNRS conjecture, improving upon a recent result of Brada\v{c}, Sudakov and Wigerson. Our work provides new insights into this pivotal conjecture in extremal graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of p-adic equiangular lines and derive the first fundamental relation between common angle, dimension of the space and the number of lines. More precisely, we show that if $\{\tau_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is p-adic $\gamma$-equiangular lines in $\mathbb{Q}^d_p$, then \begin{align*} (1) \quad\quad \quad \quad |n|^2\leq |d|\max\{|n|, \gamma^2 \}. \end{align*} We call Inequality (1) as the p-adic van Lint-Seidel relative bound. We believe that this complements fundamental van Lint-Seidel \textit{[Indag. Math., 1966]} relative bound for equiangular lines in the p-adic case.</description>

      <title>Faster parameterized algorithms for modification problems to minor-closed classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.02167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\cal G}$ be a minor-closed graph class and let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph. We say that $G$ is a $k$-apex of ${\cal G}$ if $G$ contains a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G\setminus S$ belongs to ${\cal G}$. Our first result is an algorithm that decides whether $G$ is a $k$-apex of ${\cal G}$ in time $2^{{\sf poly}(k)}\cdot n^2$, where ${\sf poly}$ is a polynomial function depending on ${\cal G}$. This algorithm improves the previous one, given by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020], whose running time was $2^{{\sf poly}(k)}\cdot n^3$. The elimination distance of $G$ to ${\cal G}$, denoted by ${\sf ed}_{\cal G}(G)$, is the minimum number of rounds required to reduce each connected component of $G$ to a graph in ${\cal G}$ by removing one vertex from each connected component in each round. Bulian and Dawar [Algorithmica 2017] provided an FPT-algorithm, with parameter $k$, to decide whether ${\sf ed}_{\cal G}(G)\leq k$. However, its dependence on $k$ is not explicit. We extend the techniques used in the first algorithm to decide whether ${\sf ed}_{\cal G}(G)\leq k$ in time $2^{2^{2^{{\sf poly}(k)}}}\cdot n^2$. This is the first algorithm for this problem with an explicit parametric dependence in $k$. In the special case where ${\cal G}$ excludes some apex-graph as a minor, we give two alternative algorithms, running in time $2^{2^{{\cal O}(k^2\log k)}}\cdot n^2$ and $2^{{\sf poly}(k)}\cdot n^3$ respectively, where $c$ and ${\sf poly}$ depend on ${\cal G}$. As a stepping stone for these algorithms, we provide an algorithm that decides whether ${\sf ed}_{\cal G}(G)\leq k$ in time $2^{{\cal O}({\sf tw}\cdot k+{\sf tw}\log{\sf tw})}\cdot n$, where ${\sf tw}$ is the treewidth of $G$. Finally, we provide explicit upper bounds on the size of the graphs in the minor-obstruction set of the class of graphs ${\cal E}_k({\cal G})=\{G\mid{\sf ed}_{\cal G}(G)\leq k\}$.</description>

      <title>Simple Combinatorial Construction of the $k^{o(1)}$-Lower Bound for Approximating the Parameterized $k$-Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the parameterized $k$-clique problem, or $k$-Clique for short, we are given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k\ge 1$. The goal is to decide whether there exist $k$ vertices in $G$ that induce a complete subgraph (i.e., a $k$-clique). This problem plays a central role in the theory of parameterized intractability as one of the first W[1]-complete problems. Existing research has shown that even an FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-Clique with arbitrary ratio does not exist, assuming the Gap-Exponential-Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Chalermsook et al., FOCS'17 and SICOMP]. However, whether this inapproximability result can be based on the standard assumption of $\mathrm{W} 1\ne \mathrm{FPT}$ remains unclear. The recent breakthrough of Bingkai Lin [STOC'21] and subsequent works by Karthik C.S. and Khot [CCC'22], and by Lin, Ren, Sun Wang [ICALP'22] give a technique that bypasses Gap-ETH, thus leading to the inapproximability ratio of $O(1)$ and $k^{o(1)}$ under $\mathrm{W}[1]$-hardness (the first two) and ETH (for the latter one). All the work along this line follows the framework developed by Lin, which starts from the $k$-vector-sum problem and requires some involved algebraic techniques.
  This paper presents an alternative framework for proving the W[1]-hardness of the $k^{o(1)}$-FPT-inapproximability of $k$-Clique. Using this framework, we obtain a gap-producing self-reduction of $k$-Clique without any intermediate algebraic problem. More precisely, we reduce from $(k,k-1)$-Gap Clique to $(q^k, q^{k-1})$-Gap Clique, for any function $q$ depending only on the parameter $k$, thus implying the $k^{o(1)}$-inapproximability result when $q$ is sufficiently large. Our proof is relatively simple and mostly combinatorial. At the core of our construction is a novel encoding of $k$-element subset stemming from the theory of "network coding" and a "Sidon set" representation of a graph.</description>
