      <title>Optimal Control of the Future via Prospective Foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents.

      <title>Effects of label noise on the classification of outlier observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan &amp; Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Sampling for Active Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Stability Analysis of Self-Consuming Generative Models with Heterogeneous Human Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09002v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.</description>

      <title>Learning to Validate Generative Models: a Goodness-of-Fit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly central to scientific workflows, yet their systematic use and interpretation require a proper understanding of their limitations through rigorous validation. Classic approaches struggle with scalability, statistical power, or interpretability when applied to high-dimensional data, making it difficult to certify the reliability of these models in realistic, high-dimensional scientific settings. Here, we propose the use of the New Physics Learning Machine (NPLM), a learning based approach to goodness-of-fit testing inspired by the Neyman-Pearson construction, to test generative networks trained on high-dimensional scientific data. We demonstrate the performance of NPLM for validation in two benchmark cases: generative models trained on mixtures of Gaussian models with increasing dimensionality, and a public end-to-end generator for the Large Hadron Collider called FlashSim, trained on jet data, typical in the field of high-energy physics. We demonstrate that the NPLM can serve as a powerful validation method while also providing a means to diagnose sub-optimally modeled regions of the data.</description>

      <title>Branching Flows: Discrete, Continuous, and Manifold Flow Matching with Splits and Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding &amp; design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.</description>

      <title>A general framework for adaptive nonparametric dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.</description>

      <title>Distributional Shrinkage I: Universal Denoisers in Multi-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \sigma Z$, where $\sigma \in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\sigma^4)$ and $O(\sigma^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \sigma^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{\sigma^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]</description>

      <title>A metrological framework for uncertainty evaluation in machine learning classification models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03359v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach to automation and uncertainty evaluation for self-validating thermocouples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermocouples are in widespread use in industry, but they are particularly susceptible to calibration drift in harsh environments. Self-validating thermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell (fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the thermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a known melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes through the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits a "plateau" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is known, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting plateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but requires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the actual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the melting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning approach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting plateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins, along with its associated uncertainty. This removes the need for human intervention in locating and characterizing the melting point. Results from test data provided by CCPI Europe show 100% accuracy of melting plateau detection. They also show a cross-validated R2 of 0.99 on predictions of calibration drift.</description>

      <title>TabPFN-2.5: Advancing the State of the Art in Tabular Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (&lt;=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Practical considerations when designing an online learning algorithm for an app-based mHealth intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous nature of mobile health (mHealth) technology has expanded opportunities for the integration of reinforcement learning into traditional clinical trial designs, allowing researchers to learn individualized treatment policies during the study. LowSalt4Life 2 (LS4L2) is a recent trial aimed at reducing sodium intake among hypertensive individuals through an app-based intervention. A reinforcement learning algorithm, which was deployed in one of the trial arms, was designed to send reminder notifications to promote app engagement in contexts where the notification would be effective, i.e., when a participant is likely to open the app in the next 30-minute and not when prior data suggested reduced effectiveness. Such an algorithm can improve app-based mHealth interventions by reducing participant burden and more effectively promoting behavior change. We encountered various challenges during the implementation of the learning algorithm, which we present as a template to solving challenges in future trials that deploy reinforcement learning algorithms. We provide template solutions based on LS4L2 for solving the key challenges of (i) defining a relevant reward, (ii) determining a meaningful timescale for optimization, (iii) specifying a robust statistical model that allows for automation, (iv) balancing model flexibility with computational cost, and (v) addressing missing values in gradually collected data.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Bias-Variance Decomposition for Bregman Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bias-variance decomposition is a central result in statistics and machine learning, but is typically presented only for the squared error. We present a generalization of the bias-variance decomposition where the prediction error is a Bregman divergence, which is relevant to maximum likelihood estimation with exponential families. While the result is already known, there was not previously a clear, standalone derivation, so we provide one for pedagogical purposes.

      <title>On topological descriptors for graph products</title>

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.</description>

      <title>Path Signatures Enable Model-Free Mapping of RNA Modifications</title>

Abstract: Detecting chemical modifications on RNA molecules remains a key challenge in epitranscriptomics. Traditional reverse transcription-based sequencing methods introduce enzyme- and sequence-dependent biases and fragment RNA molecules, confounding the accurate mapping of modifications across the transcriptome. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing offers a powerful alternative by preserving native RNA molecules, enabling the detection of modifications at single-molecule resolution. However, current computational tools can identify only a limited subset of modification types within well-characterized sequence contexts for which ample training data exists. Here, we introduce a model-free computational method that reframes modification detection as an anomaly detection problem, requiring only canonical (unmodified) RNA reads without any other annotated data. For each nanopore read, our approach extracts robust, modification-sensitive features from the raw ionic current signal at a site using the signature transform, then computes an anomaly score by comparing the resulting feature vector to its nearest neighbors in an unmodified reference dataset. We convert anomaly scores into statistical p-values to enable anomaly detection at both individual read and site levels. Validation on densely-modified \textit{E. coli} rRNA demonstrates that our approach detects known sites harboring diverse modification types, without prior training on these modifications. We further applyied this framework to dengue virus (DENV) transcripts and mammalian mRNAs. For DENV sfRNA, it led to revealing a novel 2'-O-methylated site, which we validate orthogonally by qRT-PCR assays. These results demonstrate that our model-free approach operates robustly across different types of RNAs and datasets generated with different nanopore sequencing chemistries.</description>

      <title>Covariance Scattering Transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.</description>

      <title>Controllable protein design through Feynman-Kac steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.</description>

      <title>Several Supporting Evidences for the Adaptive Feature Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimal and computationally tractable lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logit transform is arguably the most widely-employed link function beyond linear settings. This transformation routinely appears in regression models for binary data and provides a central building-block in popular methods for both classification and regression. Its widespread use, combined with the lack of analytical solutions for the optimization of objective functions involving the logit transform, still motivates active research in computational statistics. Among the directions explored, a central one has focused on the design of tangent lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods that can be tractably optimized, while providing a tight approximation of these log-likelihoods. This has led to the development of effective minorize-maximize (MM) algorithms for point estimation, and variational schemes for approximate Bayesian inference under several logit models. However, the overarching focus has been on tangent quadratic minorizers. In fact, it is still unclear whether tangent lower bounds sharper than quadratic ones can be derived without undermining the tractability of the resulting minorizer. This article addresses such a question through the design and study of a novel piece-wise quadratic lower bound that uniformly improves any tangent quadratic minorizer, including the sharpest ones, while admitting a direct interpretation in terms of the classical generalized lasso problem. As illustrated in realistic empirical studies, such a sharper bound not only improves the speed of convergence of common MM schemes for penalized maximum likelihood estimation, but also yields tractable variational Bayes (VB) approximations with higher accuracy relative to those obtained under popular quadratic bounds employed in VB.</description>

      <title>Testing and Improving the Robustness of Amortized Bayesian Inference for Cognitive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contaminant observations and outliers often cause problems when estimating the parameters of cognitive models, which are statistical models representing cognitive processes. In this study, we test and improve the robustness of parameter estimation using amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks. To this end, we conduct systematic analyses on a toy example and analyze both synthetic and real data using a popular cognitive model, the Drift Diffusion Models (DDM). First, we study the sensitivity of ABI to contaminants with tools from robust statistics: the empirical influence function and the breakdown point. Next, we propose a data augmentation or noise injection approach that incorporates a contamination distribution into the data-generating process during training. We examine several candidate distributions and evaluate their performance and cost in terms of accuracy and efficiency loss relative to a standard estimator. Introducing contaminants from a Cauchy distribution during training considerably increases the robustness of the neural density estimator as measured by bounded influence functions and a much higher breakdown point. Overall, the proposed method is straightforward and practical to implement and has a broad applicability in fields where outlier detection or removal is challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a federated learning approach for Bayesian model-based clustering of large-scale binary and categorical datasets. We introduce a principled 'divide and conquer' inference procedure using variational inference with local merge and delete moves within batches of the data in parallel, followed by 'global' merge moves across batches to find global clustering structures. We show that these merge moves require only summaries of the data in each batch, enabling federated learning across local nodes without requiring the full dataset to be shared. Empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method performs well in comparison to existing clustering algorithms. We validate the practical utility of the method by applying it to large scale electronic health record (EHR) data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-informed machine learning can exhibit advantages over machine learning which fails to account for symmetry. In the context of continuous symmetry detection, current state of the art experiments are largely limited to detecting affine transformations. Herein, we outline a computationally efficient framework for discovering infinitesimal generators of multi-parameter group actions which are not generally affine transformations. This framework accommodates the automatic discovery of the number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators. We build upon recent work in continuous symmetry discovery by extending to neural networks and by restricting the symmetry search space to infinitesimal isometries. We also introduce symmetry enforcement of smooth models using vector field regularization, thereby improving model generalization. The notion of vector field similarity is also generalized for non-Euclidean Riemannian metric tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to help decision-makers efficiently identify preferred solutions from the Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Our method uses a Bayesian model to estimate the decision-maker's utility function based on pairwise comparisons. Aided by this model, a principled elicitation strategy selects queries interactively to balance exploration and exploitation, guiding the discovery of high-utility solutions. The approach is flexible: it can be used interactively or a posteriori after estimating the Pareto front through standard multi-objective optimization techniques. Additionally, at the end of the elicitation phase, it generates a reduced menu of high-quality solutions, simplifying the decision-making process. Through experiments on test problems with up to nine objectives, our method demonstrates superior performance in finding high-utility solutions with a small number of queries. We also provide an open-source implementation of our method to support its adoption by the broader community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatin folding and the spatial arrangement of chromosomes in the cell play a crucial role in DNA replication and genes expression. An improper chromatin folding could lead to malfunctions and, over time, diseases. For eukaryotes, centromeres are essential for proper chromosome segregation and folding. Despite extensive research using de novo sequencing of genomes and annotation analysis, centromere locations in yeasts remain difficult to infer and are still unknown in most species. Recently, genome-wide chromosome conformation capture coupled with next-generation sequencing (Hi-C) has become one of the leading methods to investigate chromosome structures. Some recent studies have used Hi-C data to give a point estimate of each centromere, but those approaches highly rely on a good pre-localization. Here, we present a novel approach that infers in a stochastic manner the locations of all centromeres in budding yeast based on both the experimental Hi-C map and simulated contact maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random forests are a statistical learning technique that use bootstrap aggregation to average high-variance and low-bias trees. Improvements to random forests, such as applying Lasso regression to the tree predictions, have been proposed in order to reduce model bias. However, these changes can sometimes degrade performance (e.g., an increase in mean squared error). In this paper, we show in theory that the relative performance of these two methods, standard and Lasso-weighted random forests, depends on the signal-to-noise ratio. We further propose a unified framework to combine random forests and Lasso selection by applying adaptive weighting and show mathematically that it can strictly outperform the other two methods. We compare the three methods through simulation, including bias-variance decomposition, error estimates evaluation, and variable importance analysis. We also show the versatility of our method by applications to a variety of real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of simultaneously estimating arc travel times in a network \emph{and} parameters of route choice models for strategic and tactical network planning purposes. Hitherto, these interdependent tasks have been approached separately in the literature on road traffic networks. We illustrate that ignoring this interdependence can lead to erroneous route choice model parameter estimates. We propose a method for maximum likelihood estimation to solve the simultaneous estimation problem that is applicable to any differentiable route choice model. Moreover, our approach allows to naturally mix observations at varying levels of granularity, including noisy or partial path data. Numerical results based on real taxi data from New York City show strong performance of our method, even in comparison to a benchmark method focused solely on arc travel time estimation.</description>

      <title>Online Ensemble Learning for Sector Rotation: A Gradient-Free Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gradient-free online ensemble learning algorithm that dynamically combines forecasts from a heterogeneous set of machine learning models based on their recent predictive performance, measured by out-of-sample R-squared. The ensemble is model-agnostic, requires no gradient access, and is designed for sequential forecasting under nonstationarity. It adaptively reweights 16 constituent models-three linear benchmarks (OLS, PCR, LASSO) and thirteen nonlinear learners including Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and a hierarchy of neural networks (NN1-NN12). We apply the framework to sector rotation, using sector-level features aggregated from firm characteristics. Empirically, sector returns are more predictable and stable than individual asset returns, making them suitable for cross-sectional forecasting. The algorithm constructs sector-specific ensembles that assign adaptive weights in a rolling-window fashion, guided by forecast accuracy. Our key theoretical result bounds the online forecast regret directly in terms of realized out-of-sample R-squared, providing an interpretable guarantee that the ensemble performs nearly as well as the best model in hindsight. Empirically, the ensemble consistently outperforms individual models, equal-weighted averages, and traditional offline ensembles, delivering higher predictive accuracy, stronger risk-adjusted returns, and robustness across macroeconomic regimes, including during the COVID-19 crisis.</description>

Abstract: Bandit convex optimisation is a fundamental framework for studying zeroth-order convex optimisation. This book covers the many tools used for this problem, including cutting plane methods, interior point methods, continuous exponential weights, gradient descent and online Newton step. The nuances between the many assumptions and setups are explained. Although there is not much truly new here, some existing tools are applied in novel ways to obtain new algorithms. A few bounds are improved in minor ways.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Data Analysis for Growing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reuse of data in adaptive workflows poses challenges regarding overfitting and the statistical validity of results. Previous work has demonstrated that interacting with data via differentially private algorithms can mitigate overfitting, achieving worst-case generalization guarantees with asymptotically optimal data requirements. However, such past work assumes data is static and cannot accommodate situations where data grows over time. In this paper we address this gap, presenting the first generalization bounds for adaptive analysis on dynamic data. We allow the analyst to adaptively schedule their queries conditioned on the current size of the data, in addition to previous queries and responses. We also incorporate time-varying empirical accuracy bounds and mechanisms, allowing for tighter guarantees as data accumulates. In a batched query setting, the asymptotic data requirements of our bound grows with the square-root of the number of adaptive queries, matching prior works' improvement over data splitting for the static setting. We instantiate our bound for statistical queries with the clipped Gaussian mechanism, where it empirically outperforms baselines composed from static bounds.</description>

      <title>ExDBN: Learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks using Extended Mixed-Integer Programming Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal learning from data has received much attention recently. Bayesian networks can be used to capture causal relationships. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model. This formalism is utilized in the present contribution to propose a score-based learning algorithm. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 80 time series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bioscience and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the importance of developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle instances of modest size.</description>

      <title>Contextual Thompson Sampling via Generation of Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Thompson sampling (TS) contextual bandit algorithms, in which the algorithm's ability to quantify uncertainty and make decisions depends on the quality of a generative model that is learned offline. Instead of viewing uncertainty in the environment as arising from unobservable latent parameters, our algorithm treats uncertainty as stemming from missing, but potentially observable outcomes (including both future and counterfactual outcomes). If these outcomes were all observed, one could simply make decisions using an "oracle" policy fit on the complete dataset. Inspired by this conceptualization, at each decision-time, our algorithm uses a generative model to probabilistically impute missing outcomes, fits a policy using the imputed complete dataset, and uses that policy to select the next action. We formally show that this algorithm is a generative formulation of TS and establish a state-of-the-art regret bound. Notably, our regret bound depends on the generative model only through the quality of its offline prediction loss, and applies to any method of fitting the "oracle" policy.</description>

      <title>TAMIS: Tailored Membership Inference Attacks on Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) enable to empirically assess the privacy of a machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose TAMIS, a novel MIA against differentially-private synthetic data generation methods that rely on graphical models. This attack builds upon MAMA-MIA, a recently-published state-of-the-art method. It lowers its computational cost and requires less attacker knowledge. Our attack is the product of a two-fold improvement. First, we recover the graphical model having generated a synthetic dataset by using solely that dataset, rather than shadow-modeling over an auxiliary one. This proves less costly and more performant. Second, we introduce a more mathematically-grounded attack score, that provides a natural threshold for binary predictions. In our experiments, TAMIS achieves better or similar performance as MAMA-MIA on replicas of the SNAKE challenge.</description>

      <title>Weak instrumental variables due to nonlinearities in panel data: A Super Learner Control Function estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03228v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triangular structural panel data model with additive separable individual-specific effects is used to model the causal effect of a covariate on an outcome variable when there are unobservable confounders with some of them time-invariant. In this setup, a linear reduced-form equation might be problematic when the conditional mean of the endogenous covariate and the instrumental variables is nonlinear. The reason is that ignoring the nonlinearity could lead to weak instruments (instruments are weakly correlated with the endogeneous covariate). As a solution, we propose a triangular simultaneous equation model for panel data with additive separable individual-specific fixed effects composed of a linear structural equation with a nonlinear reduced form equation. The parameter of interest is the structural parameter of the endogenous variable. The identification of this parameter is obtained under the assumption of available exclusion restrictions and using a control function approach. Estimating the parameter of interest is done using an estimator that we call Super Learner Control Function (SLCF) estimator. The estimation procedure is composed of two main steps and sample splitting. First, we estimate the control function using a super learner . In the following step, we use the estimated control function to control for endogeneity in the structural equation. Sample splitting is done across the individual dimension. The estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal achieving a parametric rate of convergence. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation to test the performance of the estimators proposed. We conclude that the Super Learner Control Function Estimators significantly outperform Within 2SLS estimators.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach to Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground-truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data include label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. However, Bayesian inference for such spatially correlated discrete variables is notoriously intractable. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce a novel class of probabilistic models, which we term the ELBO-Computable Correlated Discrete Distribution (ECCD). By representing the discrete dependencies through a continuous latent Gaussian field with a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) structured covariance, our framework enables scalable and efficient variational inference for problems previously considered computationally prohibitive. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backwards SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering potential algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a tradeoff: mechanistic models provide scientific grounding but struggle with real-world complexity, while machine learning models achieve strong predictive performance but require large labeled datasets and are not interpretable. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), which use mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. Simulation-grounded learning has been applied in multiple domains (e.g., surrogate models in physics, forecasting in epidemiology). We provide a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning and evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks. We found that SGNNs were successful across domains: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one-third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task-specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a form of mechanistic interpretability. Back-to-simulation attribution matches real-world observations to the training simulations the model considers most similar, identifying which mechanistic processes the model believes best explain the observed data. By providing a unified framework for simulation-grounded learning, we establish when and how mechanistic simulations can serve as effective training data for robust, interpretable scientific inference.</description>

      <title>Generative AI models capture realistic sea-ice evolution from days to decades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sea ice plays an important role in stabilising the Earth system. Yet, representing its dynamics remains a major challenge for models, as the underlying processes are scale-invariant and highly anisotropic. This poses a dilemma: physics-based models that faithfully reproduce the observed dynamics are computationally costly, while efficient AI models sacrifice realism. Here, to resolve this dilemma, we introduce GenSIM, the first generative AI model to predict the evolution of the full Arctic sea-ice state at 12-hour increments. Trained for sub-daily forecasting on 20 years of sea-ice-ocean simulation data, GenSIM makes realistic predictions for 30 years, while reproducing the dynamical properties of sea ice with its leads and ridges and capturing long-term trends in the sea-ice volume. Notably, although solely driven by atmospheric reanalysis, GenSIM implicitly learns hidden signatures of multi-year ice-ocean interaction. Therefore, generative AI can extrapolate from sub-daily forecasts to decadal simulations, while retaining physical consistency.</description>

      <title>Jet Functors and Weil Algebras in Automatic Differentiation: A Geometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a differential-geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) based on jet functors and Weil algebras. In this framework, forward- and reverse-mode differentiation arise naturally as pushforward and cotangent pullback, while higher-order differentiation corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. This construction provides a unified, coordinate-free view of derivative propagation and clarifies the algebraic structure underlying AD. All results are realized in modern JAX code, where the Weil-mode formulation computes all mixed derivatives in a single forward pass with cost linear in the algebra dimension. The resulting implementation achieves algebraically exact and numerically stable differentiation with predictable scaling, demonstrating that geometric abstraction can yield more efficient and transparent computational differentiation systems.

      <description>arXiv:2510.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Optimization and Generalization Bounds for Stochastic Gauss-Newton in Overparameterized Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important question in deep learning is how higher-order optimization methods affect generalization. In this work, we analyze a stochastic Gauss-Newton (SGN) method with Levenberg-Marquardt damping and mini-batch sampling for training overparameterized deep neural networks with smooth activations in a regression setting. Our theoretical contributions are twofold. First, we establish finite-time convergence bounds via a variable-metric analysis in parameter space, with explicit dependencies on the batch size, network width and depth. Second, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for SGN using uniform stability in the overparameterized regime, characterizing the impact of curvature, batch size, and overparameterization on generalization performance. Our theoretical results identify a favorable generalization regime for SGN in which a larger minimum eigenvalue of the Gauss-Newton matrix along the optimization path yields tighter stability bounds.</description>

Abstract: Learning manipulable representations of the world and its dynamics is central to AI. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) offer a promising blueprint, but lack of practical guidance and theory has led to ad-hoc R&amp;D. We present a comprehensive theory of JEPAs and instantiate it in {\bf LeJEPA}, a lean, scalable, and theoretically grounded training objective. First, we identify the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution that JEPAs' embeddings should follow to minimize downstream prediction risk. Second, we introduce a novel objective--{\bf Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization} (SIGReg)--to constrain embeddings to reach that ideal distribution. Combining the JEPA predictive loss with SIGReg yields LeJEPA with numerous theoretical and practical benefits: (i) single trade-off hyperparameter, (ii) linear time and memory complexity, (iii) stability across hyper-parameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets) and domains, (iv) heuristics-free, e.g., no stop-gradient, no teacher-student, no hyper-parameter schedulers, and (v) distributed training-friendly implementation requiring only $\approx$50 lines of code. Our empirical validation covers 10+ datasets, 60+ architectures, all with varying scales and domains. As an example, using imagenet-1k for pretraining and linear evaluation with frozen backbone, LeJEPA reaches 79\% with a ViT-H/14. We hope that the simplicity and theory-friendly ecosystem offered by LeJEPA will reestablish self-supervised pre-training as a core pillar of AI research (\href{https://github.com/rbalestr-lab/lejepa}{GitHub repo}).</description>
