      <title>Beyond one-loop: higher-order effects on Gross-Neveu-Yukawa tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} &lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f &gt; N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Tuning between a fractional topological insulator and competing phases at $\nu_\mathrm{T}=2/3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a spinful, time-reversal symmetric lowest Landau level model for a flatband quantum spin Hall system at total filling fraction $\nu_\mathrm{T}=2/3$. Such models are relevant, e.g. for spin-valley locked moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides. The opposite Chern number of the two spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111) state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$, the relative angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Bosonized theory of de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillation in Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvA) of a 2d Fermi liquid remains poorly understood, due to the $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ contribution to the oscillations of grand potential from the oscillatory part of the fermionic self energy, which has no known closed-form solution. In this work, we solve this problem via coadjoint-orbit bosonization of the Fermi surface. Compared with the fermionic formalism, the issue of the oscillatory self energy is circumvented. As an effective field theory, Landau parameters $F_{n}$ directly enter the theory. We use the bosonized theory to derive the energies of cyclotron resonance and specific heat, which are consistent with Fermi liquid theory. Via a mode expansion, we show that the problem of dHvA is reduced to 0+1D quantum mechanics. We obtain analytic expressions for the behavior of dHvA at low and high temperatures, which deviate from the well-known Lifshitz-Kosevich formula. We contrast this behavior with that of 3d Fermi liquids, for which we show such deviations are parametrically small. We discuss the effects of disorder on dHvA within the bosonized theory.</description>

      <title>The electronic structures, magnetic transition and Fermi surface instability of room-temperature altermagnet KV$_{2}$Se$_{2}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.</description>

      <title>Spin Liquid Mimicry in the Hydroxide Double Perovskite CuSn(OH)$_6$ Induced by Correlated Proton Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra, making it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but relatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In the hydroxide double perovskite \cusnoh, magnetic frustration of the Cu$^{2+}$ quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller distortions. Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 45\,mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in specific heat and magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin correlations\, -- \,a behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such an unusual robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of quantum fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration on the highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated proton disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in YbMgGaO$_4$ and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range magnetic order by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction network. However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic sublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be tuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the prospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better understand its influence on the magnetic ground state.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Peierls transition with nonsymmorphic zone boundary gap formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonsymmorphic space group symmetry breakings in correlated electron systems. Under nonsymmorphic symmetry, it is well known that there are degeneracies in the electronic Bloch states at the Brillouin zone boundaries. When the system undergoes a phase transition into an ordered phase with breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry, the degeneracy is lifted. This happens even when the order parameter is uniform. We point out that this general feature leads to various {\it uniform} Peierls transition in nonsymmorphic systems. In particular, we show that such mechanism of the Peierls gap formation can be realized accompanying with uniform anisotropic Kondo singlet formations. This explains the hidden electric order observed in CeCoSi.</description>

      <title>New plasmon-like mode in PdTe$_{2}$: Raman scattering and memory function study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode. Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit anomalous behavior above 100 K.</description>

      <title>Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.</description>

      <title>The Interacting Energy Bands of Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene Revealed by the Quantum Twisting Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>An analysis of derivative absorption spectroscopy of multiferroic bismuth ferrite materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of bulk BiFeO3, nanostructured BiFeO$_3$, and thick film of BiFeO$_{2.85}$ were studied in detail based on their experimental absorption data. The goal of this study was to investigate the electronic transitions and the Urbach tail band in three samples of the magnetoelectric multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. The PDF and CDF functions were derived from the absorption data of these substances in the UV-visible-NIR region of light spectrum. For the BiFeO$_3$-based materials, charge transfer (p-d and/or p-p) transitions in the energy range of 2.5 eV to 5.5 eV were identified through PDF and CDF analysis. Furthermore, spin-orbit and electron-lattice interactions along with a low-symmetry crystal field cause two doubly degenerate d-d transitions of Fe$^{3+}$ ions in the FeO$_6$ octahedra of the BiFeO$_3$ samples to occur between 1.5 eV and 2.5 eV. Additionally, the BiFeO3-based materials exhibited strong direct and weak indirect transitions near the band edge, which point to a complex band structure of BiFeO$_3$. Finally, the energy of the defect-induced Urbach tail band was directly calculated by examining the CDF function of the materials, yielding estimated values of approximately 0.40 eV, 0.31 eV, and 0.33 eV for the bulk, nanostructured, and film BiFeO$_3$ samples, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics, chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition. Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Assisted Ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost. Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$ of the total CI basis states.</description>

One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry breaking in 1D spin chains and 1+1D field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1) ``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x, S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning. Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest. The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.</description>

      <title>Tuning Charge Order in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br, Cl) via Uniaxial Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate tuning in both directions across a second-order ferroelectric phase transition via uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Three-stage Phase Transitions and Field-induced Phases in CeCoSi:A Landau Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate both the nonmagnetic and magnetic ordered phases of CeCoSi using Landau theory. Our analysis predicts three successive phase transitions at zero magnetic field. A quadrupole order parameter that emerges below $T_0=12$ K acts as a weak symmetry-breaking field on the antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N}=9.4$ K, leading to two-stage magnetic transitions. In the higher-temperature antiferromagnetic phase within the range $T_{\rm s2}=8~{\rm K}&lt;T&lt;T_{\rm N}$, an out-of-plane component of the antiferromagnetic moment may or may not be present. If present, magnetic fields applied along the [100] and [110] directions induce additional magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Few-fermion resonant tunneling and underbarrier trapping in asymmetric potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum tunneling in many-body systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and nanoscale device design. Despite extensive studies of quantum tunneling, the role of interactions in determining directional transport through asymmetric barriers in discrete quantum systems remains unclear. Here we show that noninteracting fermions exhibit symmetric tunneling probabilities regardless of barrier orientation, while inter-particle interactions break this symmetry and create pronounced asymmetric tunneling behavior. We explore the dependence of tunneling behavior on the initial spin configurations of two spin-1/2 fermions: spin-triplet states preserve tunneling symmetry, while spin-singlet states show strong asymmetry. We identify regimes where interactions mediate tunneling through under-barrier resonant trapping and enhance tunneling via many-body resonant tunneling -- a phenomenon arising solely from inter-particle interactions and being fundamentally different from traditional single-particle resonant tunneling. Our results may be applied to the design of nanoscale devices with tailored transport properties, such as diodes and memristors.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</description>

      <title>TBHubbard: tight-binding and extended Hubbard model database for metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Due to their chemical diversity, MOFs can support a broad range of applications in chemical separations. However, the vast amount of structural compositions encoded in crystallographic information files complicates application-oriented, computational screening and design. The existing crystallographic data, therefore, requires augmentation by simulated data so that suitable descriptors for machine-learning and quantum computing tasks become available. Here, we provide extensive simulation data augmentation for MOFs within the QMOF database. We have applied a tight-binding, lattice Hamiltonian and density functional theory to MOFs for performing electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we provide a tight-binding representation of 10,000 MOFs, and an Extended Hubbard model representation for a sub-set of 240 MOFs containing transition metals, where intra-site U and inter-site V parameters are computed self-consistently. The data supports computational workflows for identifying structure-property correlations that are needed for inverse material design. For validation and reuse, we have made the data available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/tbhubbard/.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a realistic model relevant to La$_2$CuO$_4$ and other altermagnetic perovskite oxides, we study interrelations between weak ferromagnetism (WF), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and net orbital magnetization (OM). All of them can be linked to the form of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Nevertheless, while spin WF is induced by the DM vector components having the same sign in all equivalent bonds, AHE and OM are related to alternating-sign components, which do not contribute to any canting of spins. The microscopic model remains invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t} \}$, combining the shift ${\bf t}$ of antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices to each other with the spin flip $\mathcal{S}$. Thus, the band structure remains spin-degenerate, but the time-reversal symmetry is broken, providing a possibility to realize AHE in antiferromagnetic substances. The altermagnetic splitting of bands, breaking the $\{ \mathcal{S}|{\bf t}\}$ symmetry, does not play a major role in the problem. More important is the orthorhombic strain, responsible for finite values of AHE and OM.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>
