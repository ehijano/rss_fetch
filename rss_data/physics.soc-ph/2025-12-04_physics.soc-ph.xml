      <title>Quantum Simulations of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers powerful new approaches for modeling complex social phenomena. Here, we propose and demonstrate quantum simulations of opinion dynamics, leveraging quantum superposition, measurement-induced state collapse, and entanglement to model realistic psychological and social processes. Specifically, we develop quantum models of opinion dynamics, solving exactly and simulating on IBM Quantum hardware. Our results, based on quantum devices and validated with practical quantum circuits, illustrate how quantum effects can enhance understanding of consensus formation, polarization, and collective decision-making. These findings pave the way for further exploration into quantum-enhanced social modeling, highlighting the potential of near-term quantum computers for simulating collective behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Diplomacy within the Southeast Asia Quantum Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 (IYQ 2025), a significant portion of global funding has been dedicated to various quantum initiatives, with over 30 countries announcing their respective quantum strategies. Within the Southeast Asia context, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines have launched their respective quantum strategies and roadmaps. Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. While several discussions regarding Malaysia's quantum initiative and strategy are ongoing, it is vital to broaden the conversation and position Malaysia within the regional ecosystem. This paper provides an overview of Malaysia's quantum landscape and a summary of the regional initiatives since the establishment of Southeast Asia Quantum Network. We then analyse Malaysia's strengths in quantum research and provide four recommendations to strengthen the regional ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced stop-and-go traffic dynamics: Modelling and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution investigates an original stochastic approach for the emergence of stop-and-go waves in traffic flow, a collective phenomenon with significant safety and environmental implications. Using a stable nonlinear car-following model, the study shows that minimal white Gaussian noise can destabilise the flow, leading to a phase transition from laminar to periodic dynamics through a nonlinear instability phenomenon, analogous to Kapitza's pendulum. Furthermore, a simple linear transformation of the model, which amplifies the response and introduces a positive acceleration bias, counteracts noise-induced effects and recovers the stability of uniform solutions. The findings are supported by simulations, offering new insights into the modelling and mitigation of oscillatory traffic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Accumulated Local Effects and Graph Neural Networks for link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), a model-agnostic explanation method, can be adapted to visualize the influence of node feature values in link prediction tasks using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks. A key challenge addressed in this work is the complex interactions of nodes during message passing within GNN layers, complicating the direct application of ALE. Since a straightforward solution of modifying only one node at once substantially increases computation time, we propose an approximate method that mitigates this challenge. Our findings reveal that although the approximate method offers computational efficiency, the exact method yields more stable explanations, particularly when smaller data subsets are used. However, the explanations produced with the approximate method are not significantly different from the ones obtained with the exact method. Additionally, we analyze how varying parameters affect the accuracy of ALE estimation for both approaches.</description>

      <title>Inaccessibility in Public Transit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of networks derived from infrastructure systems has received considerable attention, yet the accessibility of such systems, particularly within public transit networks, remains comparatively underexplored. Accessibility encompasses a broad range of considerations, from infrastructure-based features such as elevators and step-free access to spatial factors such as the geographic distribution of accessible stations. In this work, we investigate infrastructure-based accessibility in two major transit systems: the London Underground and the New York City Subway. We construct network models in which nodes represent accessible stations and edges represent adjacency along transit lines. Using tools from network analysis, we examine the structural properties of these accessibility networks, including clustering patterns and the spatial distribution of accessible nodes. We further employ centrality measures to identify stations that serve as major accessible hubs. Finally, we analyze socioeconomic and tourism-related variables to assess the influence of neighborhood wealth and popularity on the prevalence of accessible stations. Our findings highlight significant disparities in accessibility across both systems and demonstrate the utility of mathematical and network-theoretic methods in understanding and improving modern transit infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Comparing land- and skyscapes in the three main manorial-conquered lands of the Canary Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a study of the relationship between astronomy and landscape focused on the orientation of Christian churches of the three main Manorial (Se\~nor\'io) Islands of the Canary archipelago (Spain): Lanzarote, La Gomera and Fuerteventura. As a background, we have the information provided by the texts of early Christian writers, which imposed that churches should be oriented towards the east [..]. The fieldwork that supports our comparative study is based on the measurement of the precise location coordinates, axis' azimuth and angular height of the horizon for most of the churches of the three islands, which amounts to about 120 sets of measurements. For the study of the sample, we have employed various analyses, both statistical, as well as calendric and orographic. Our results show that on all the islands, the pattern of double orientations is repeated, which contemplates the canonical tradition of orienting the altars of churches within the solar range (pointing either eastward or westward). Very few cases also occur where it is possible to identify constructions whose orientation follows solstitial patterns, perhaps as imitation of aboriginal worship. But this double pattern also includes a high proportion of churches with orientations far from this range. An example is Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, both islands subjected to the same flow of the prevailing trade winds in the region, but each with its own characteristics. Another example is given by the particular orography of deep ravines of La Gomera, which determines the orientation of the temples located in those geographical accidents. In this paper we show how the combination of elements of the land- and skyscape can, with a high degree of probability, offer a satisfactory explanation to the particular orientation of these insular centres of worship, which were built during the first decades after the European conquest.</description>

      <title>Diversity mitigates polarization and consensus in opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the opinion dynamics in a population by considering a variant of Kuramoto model where the phase of an oscillator represents the opinion of an individual on a single topic. Two extreme phases separated by $\pi$ represent opposing views. Any other phase is considered as an intermediate opinion between the two extremes. The interaction (or attitude) between two individuals depends on the difference between their opinions and can be positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) based on the defined thresholds. We investigate the opinion dynamics when these thresholds are varied. We observe explosive transition from a bipolarized state to a consensus state with the existence of scattered and tri-polarized states at low values of threshold parameter. The system exhibits multistability between various states in a sizeable parameter region. These transitions and multistability are studied in populations with different degrees of diversity represented by the width of conviction distribution. We found that a more homogeneous population has greater tendency to exhibit bipolarized, tri-polarized and clustered states while a diverse population helps mitigate polarization among individuals by reaching to a consensus sooner. Ott-Antonsen analysis is used to analyse the system's long term macroscopic behaviour and verify the numerical results. We also study the effects of neutral individuals that do not interact with others or do not change their attitude on opinion formation, nature of transitions and multistability. Furthermore, we apply our model to language data to study the assimilation of diverse languages in India and compare the results with those obtained from model equations.</description>

      <title>Musical consonance: a review of theory and evidence on perception and preference of auditory roughness in humans and other animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origins of consonance in human music has long been contested, and today there are three primary hypotheses: aversion to roughness, preference for harmonicity, and learned preferences from cultural exposure. While the evidence is currently insufficient to disentangle the contributions of these hypotheses, I propose several reasons why roughness is an especially promising area for future study. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate roughness theory and models, experimental data, to highlight areas that deserve further research. I identify 2 key areas: There are fundamental issues with the definition and interpretation of results due to tautology in the definition of roughness, and the lack of independence in empirical measurements. Despite extensive model development, there are many duplications and models have issues with data quality and overfitting. Future theory development should aim for model simplicity, and extra assumptions, features and parameters should be evaluated systematically. Model evaluation should aim to maximise the breadth of stimuli that are predicted.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-driven framework triangulating data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While traditional data systems remain fundamental to humanitarian response, they often lack the real-time responsiveness and spatial precision needed to capture increasingly complex patterns of displacement. Internal displacement reached an unprecedented 83.4 million people by the end of 2024, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, data driven approaches to monitor and understand population movements. This report examines how integrating traditional data sources with emerging digital trace data, such as mobile phone GPS and social media activity, can enhance the accuracy, responsiveness, and granularity of displacement monitoring. Drawing on lessons from recent crises, including the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the 2022 floods in Pakistan, the report presents a structured pilot effort that tests the triangulation of multiple data streams to produce more robust and reliable displacement estimates. Statistical indicators derived from digital trace data are benchmarked against the International Organisation for Migration, Displacement Tracking Matrix datasets, to assess their validity, transparency, and scalability. The findings demonstrate how triangulated data approaches can deliver real-time, high-resolution insights into population movements, improving humanitarian resource allocation and intervention planning. The report includes a scalable framework for crisis monitoring that leverages digital innovation to strengthen humanitarian data systems and support evidence-based decision-making in complex emergencies.</description>

      <title>Why is the estimation of metaorder impact with public market data so challenging?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating market impact and transaction costs of large trades (metaorders) is a very important topic in finance. However, using models of price and trade based on public market data provide average price trajectories which are qualitatively different from what is observed during real metaorder executions: the price increases linearly, rather than in a concave way, during the execution and the amount of reversion after its end is very limited. We claim that this is a generic phenomenon due to the fact that even sophisticated statistical models are unable to correctly describe the origin of the autocorrelation of the order flow. We propose a modified Transient Impact Model which provides more realistic trajectories by assuming that only a fraction of the metaorder trading triggers market order flow. Interestingly, in our model there is a critical condition on the kernels of the price and order flow equations in which market impact becomes permanent.</description>
